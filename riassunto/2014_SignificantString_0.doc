- Its an old idea: If you want to build  company that truly motivates its employees ,  it has to have  sense of purpose 


-  When such  purpose exists ,  it provides employees with  clear sense of direction ,  helps them prioritize and inspires them to go the extra mile  which ,  the argument goes ,  should ultimately be good for profit 


-  ,  Purpose ,  by its nature ,  transcends making money: It is about people coming together to do something they believe in and allowing profit to follow as  consequence ,  rather than as an end in itself 


-  ,  Is it possible for  company to strive for  higher purpose while also delivering solid profits? Some have argued that pursuing goals other than making money means ,  by definition ,  spending on things that arent profit-maximizing 


-  Others have countered that by investing in worthwhile causes ,  the company is doing something intrinsically valuable that will generate  long-term payoff to all parties 


-  Instead ,  the question to ask is: How can the tension between purpose and profits best be managed? What structures does  company need to put in place to ensure that its higher-order purpose isnt squeezed out by short-term profit seeking? How can executives ensure that employees keep these dual goals in mind on  day-to-day basis? And how can this balance be achieved on  long-term basis? ,  This article is based on research that we have conducted over the last five years looking at the organizational challenges involved in managing two different objectives at the same time 


-  )  We have discovered that there are  few fundamental organizing principles that help  company sustain its sense of purpose over time while still achieving  solid level of profitability 


-  Goal-framing theory provides  deep understanding of why pursuing what we call pro-social goals  which we define as goals that involve working toward common causes that go beyond just making money and staying in business  creates  stronger motivational basis for working in organizations than pursuing self-interest goals that emphasize financial gain or personal enjoyment 


-  ,  Understanding how  companys goals influence its performance requires understanding what motivates employees behavior on  day-to-day basis 


-  That individuals are motivated to do their own work well is important ,  but  company with  higher-order purpose is typically asking them to also take  broader view and influence their joint effort toward common goals 


-  Collaborative effort of this type involves  lot more than just doing  task well; it also takes understanding of and commitment to the common goal ,  and it takes the flexibility to use ones wits ,  especially when new situations arise 


-  For this kind of work ,  employees must be motivated in  special way 


-  ,  There are numerous ,  partly overlapping views on what drives motivation in companies 


-  However ,  most have little to say about the links between company goals and individual motivations ,  that is ,  what motivates employees to behave in ways that help  or dont help  the company or group to which they belong 


-  When employees are concerned about feeling good ,  they will look out for the fun parts of their job ,  for the one activity in their job that really excites them ,  and they will neglect things that feel boring or  bit uncertain 


-  And when the major concern is to realize  common goal ,  such as getting  product launched on  tight timeline or delivering on  fundraising campaign ,  employees will attend mainly to that goal and will downplay concerns for relaxation ,  making more money or getting  better position 


-  The essence of  pro-social goal is that it motivates the employee to ask ,  What should  do to make us succeed? rather than What should  do to get ahead? or What will be the most enjoyable thing to do? ,  What factors influence the relative strength of these three types of goals? Obviously ,  innate differences between individuals plays  part ,  but  much stronger influence is typically the immediate stimuli employees receive from those around them in their working environment and from their superiors 


-  But many companies want their employees to help the organization realize common goals ,  rather than to prioritize personal gain or fun on the job 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  and this is  key point ,  the motivation to pursue pro-social goals is inherently fragile 


-  Working toward company goals without being rewarded and without feeling good is not  stable long-term proposition 


-  So there is  delicate balance needed here ,  and goal-framing theory provides some valuable insights into how it might be maintained 


-  ,  Second ,  the fragility of pro-social goals means that they need reinforcing and supporting on  consistent and regular basis through incentive and reward systems ,  through informal conversations and discussions ,  through symbolic management and through formal structures that we call counterweights 


-  And managers should seek to acknowledge and highlight behaviors that support the pro-social goals of the company by ,  for example ,  building them into annual reviews and publicly celebrating and rewarding employees who successfully strive to meet the companys pro-social goals 


-  Our research found many companies with  clear sense of purpose ,  typically expressed as  set of pro-social goals such as putting employees first or investing in local communities 


-  )  In talking to employees at multiple levels and in looking at the way they behaved and the things they valued ,  we could see evidence that these companies pro-social goals were influencing employee motivation and behavior 


-  Unlike  number of its competitors ,  Handelsbanken steered  course through the Swedish financial crisis in the early 1990s without government help ,  and it has sailed through the last five years of turbulence with uninterrupted growth in equity per share and with top ratings for customer satisfaction 


-  ,  How has Handelsbanken been so consistently successful? Its pro-social goal is not very original: It is simply to be customer-focused 


-  As the company declares on its website: Since the early 1970s ,  Handelsbankens organization has been strongly decentralized and operations are always based on the customers requirements 


-  This means that all business decisions regarding individual customers relationships with the Bank are taken close to the customer 


- 13 ,  But rather than just talk about customer focus ,  Handelsbanken has built  management model that supports its goals 


-  Managers of individual branches have much more discretion regarding loans and employee salaries than is customary in the industry 


-  The company was also  pioneer of the beyond-budgeting movement: It has moved away from setting budgets on  top-down basis ,  and instead it expects branch managers to set their own targets 


- 14 ,  There is no emphasis on maximizing returns or shareholder returns; the goals are simply to track  moving target by always having higher customer satisfaction and profitability than  weighted average of the competition 


-  Family-founded trusts hold 66% of the equity capital of Tata Sons ,   holding company 


-  ,  The charitable trusts that own 66% of Tata Sons spend their profits on charitable causes such as clean water delivery ,  literacy and health care 


-  The Tata operating companies are then expected to put significant investments into the local communities they serve 


-  Nayar ,  who became CEO in 2007 ,  decided to differentiate HCL through the quality of its management  by putting his employees first and by enabling them to create value in their relationships with customers 


-  He embarked on  major transformation program ,  first pushing everyone to accept that the company was underperforming and needed to change and then putting in place  series of specific initiatives that were designed to help employees service their clients better 


-  For example ,  he pushed all managers to place the results of their 360-degree appraisals online to make them more accountable to their employees; he also created  service ticket scheme ,  so that if an employee wasnt happy about something he could open  ticket to get the attention of the relevant manager 


-  ,  As these initiatives began to take hold ,  Nayar captured his philosophy with the slogan employees first ,  customers second ,  which he announced  with some trepidation  at the annual global customer meeting 


-  )  ,  So what are the insights from these three brief case studies? The basic premise is that what motivates employees consistently to realize company goals also makes economic sense 


-  For Handelsbanken ,  it is all about the customer; for Tata ,  it is about the communities in which the company operates; and for HCL ,  the pro-social goal is employee well-being 


-  ,  Pro-social goals need supporting systems if they are to stick 


-  ,  Support systems are needed to reinforce goals 


-  For companies that see customer focus as their goal ,  the Net Promoter Score has become  popular measure; for those that seek to put their employees first ,  engagement scores are often used; and for those that focus on safety ,  lost-time injuries are typically  preferred metric 


-  ,  Pro-social goals need  counterweight to endure 


-  For Tata Group ,  it is the family-endowed trusts 


-  At the Guardian newspaper ,  the counterweight is the editor ,  who is appointed by the ultimate owner of the newspaper  ( the Scott Trust Limited )  and is free to exercise editorial control over content ,  regardless of the companys commercial priorities 


-  But goal-framing theory suggests that the most successful companies are balancing multiple objectives  ( pro-social goals ,  gain goals ,  hedonic goals )  that are not entirely compatible with one another ,  which makes  simple linear approach very hard to sustain 


-  ,  So an important mental leap to make is the notion that long-term profits are often best achieved obliquely ,  or indirectly 


- 20 As Ratan Tata ,  former CEO of the Tata Group ,  has observed ,  Profits are like happiness in that they are  byproduct of other things  [companies] need sustainability strategies that recognize that you can make money by doing good things rather than the other way around 


- 21 In their best-selling business book Built to Last ,  Jim Collins and Jerry Porras argue that visionary companies with pro-social goals had better long-term profitability than their benchmark competitors ,  which typically opted for narrower financial goals 


- 22 ,  What does this mean in practical terms? If you want your employees to align around  pro-social goal ,  you have to eschew narrow ,  linear thinking ,  and instead provide more scope for them to choose their own oblique pathway 


-  The logic of pro-sociality first ,  profitability second needs to find its way deeply into the collective psyche of the company 


-  But what if you are lower in the corporate hierarchy? It is tempting to think this is someone elses problem ,  but actually there is no reason why you cannot follow your own version of the same process 


-  Bushs exasperated reaction to friendly suggestions that he invest time in carefully thinking about his prospective presidency: Oh ,  the vision thing 


- 23 Many CEOs react in much the same way: They know they are supposed to have  corporate vision or purpose ,  but they secretly think that wordy statements about the purpose of their business are just empty rhetoric 


-  ,  The purpose of this article is to help you to understand why and how  corporate purpose matters and to show how it can be realized without sacrificing profitability  and indeed may result in higher profitability 


-  However ,  these goals compete with other goals for individual mind share and are easily driven out by gain and hedonic goals
