- If you ask most Americans what they know about the Endangered Species Act  ( ESA )  ,  they will likely respond ,  the spotted owl 


-  This Pacific Northwest controversy epitomizes the conflict between jobs and the environment that the ESA has come to symbolize 


-  To protect the spotted owl ,  large tracts of federal lands were withheld from logging ,  the supply of raw timber decreased ,  mill capacity was eliminated ,  logging jobs were lost ,  and prices increased 


-  As this example illustrates ,  endangered species protection can alter local ,  regional ,  and national economies 


-  It also shows the kind of win-lose negotiations that typify ESA debates 


-  Each side in the debate sees beating the other as the way to achieve its goals 


-  Environmentalists want  better environment and are willing to sacrifice economic development toward that end 


-  Development interests want economic growth and consider it unacceptable to forfeit jobs or economic prosperity for species protection 


-  ,  As species protection is weakened ,  we move toward satisfying development interests at the expense of environmental interests 


-  As species protection is strengthened ,  we move toward satisfying environmental interests at the expense of development interests 


-  Undoubtedly ,  such  tug-of-war debate will always persist ,  but we argue that there are opportunities to expand the scope of debate ,  finding solutions that will improve the potential outcome simultaneously for both environmental and development interests 


-  ,  In the managerial negotiations literature ,  scholars used to argue over whether to follow  win-lose philosophy or  win-win philosophy 


-  But more recent formulations argue that either is costly 


-  Rather ,  rational negotiators now think about how to first create  larger pie and then claim  significant portion of that pie ,  subject to concerns for fairness and the ongoing negotiation relationship 


-  But environmentalists and developers are still trapped in win-lose debates 


-  While political debates have fueled the dichotomy between environmentalists and development interests ,  we see the need for  balanced perspective to manage the two sets of concerns simultaneously 


-  We then argue that ,  when viewed from  broad economic perspective ,  the benefits derived from nature can ,  under certain circumstances ,  create mutual gain solutions for both economic and environmental interests 


-  It becomes clear that it is not the objectives of the Endangered Species Act that cause economic dilemmas but its implementation 


-  To that end ,  we offer practical ways to improve ESA implementation 


-  ,  In species protection debates ,  public opinion is often formed by anecdotes rather than by the substance or objectives of legislation 


-  The attention that the ESA garners centers on costs to individual landowners and ignores the aggregate economy 


-  For example ,  Ben Cone ,   forester in North Carolina ,  shifted from  sixty-year tradition of sustainable forest management to clear-cutting when he feared finding the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker on his property 


-  Clearly ,  this is not the solution that the ESA intended 


-  But this kind of image captures national attention and comes to symbolize ESA outcomes 


-  In reality ,  it was not the acts implementation that caused Cones actions but rather his misperceptions ,  which precipitated  hasty reaction 


-  Only after the story became  touchstone for ESA critics was it revealed that endangered species considerations affected only 15 percent of Cones land 


-  Furthermore ,  the Fish and Wildlife Service  ( FWS )  repeatedly offered Cone habitat conservation proposals ,  insulating him from future ESA responsibilities ,  but he refused to cooperate ,  fearing further economic loss 


-  Cones fear of the complete devaluation of his assets led him toward  radical protective strategy 


-  In 1973 ,  the ESA was created to protect endangered or threatened species and restore them to  secure status in the wild 


-  Each agency maintains  list of plants and animals considered worthy of protection under the act 


-  Species listed as endangered are at risk of extinction throughout all or  significant portion of their range 


-  Those threatened are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future 


-  Further ,  it becomes illegal to kill ,  harass ,  possess ,  or remove the protected species from the wild  ( taking  species )  


-  Section  is administered through an interagency consultation process ,  in which the FWS or NMFS gives biological opinions to development and permitting agencies on proposed action 


-  ,  Of the 781 domestic species for which the FWS was responsible as of May 1993 ,  the majority lived on private land  ( see Figure  )  


-  Although no court has ever found that operation of the ESA has taken private property in violation of the Fifth Amendment ,  the costs associated with endangered species protection are real ,  at times resulting in significant economic impacts at the local and regional level 


-  Economic effects are due to:  (  )  delays from providing permits and petitioning ,  (  )  alterations to development plans to accommodate endangered species protection ,  and  (  )  in the most extreme cases ,  job loss due to endangered species restrictions 


-  The last category is the most visible ,  but all three incur economic costs to private developers 


-  To balance the objectives of species protection and economic development ,  section 10 of the ESA allows private landowners to formulate habitat conservation plans  ( HCPs )  


-  Stephen Meyer ,  director of the Environmental Politics and Policy Center at MIT ,  studied the impact of endangered species listings on state economies and the agricultural sector 


-  He found that ,  first ,  endangered species listings have not depressed state economic development activity as measured by growth in construction employment and gross state product and ,  second ,  the assertion that the Endangered Species Act has harmed the American farmer ,  hobbled agricultural production ,  and decimated the forest industry is baseless 


-  And the number of projects hindered by ESA implementation between 1987 and 1995 is very small  ( see Figure  )  


-  As  result ,  in the ensuing debate ,  some had an interest in resisting and trying to delay this market transformation ,  while others quietly capitalized on the opportunity it created 


-  Some in the forestry industry deftly placed blame for their economic circumstances on the ESA ,  while others successfully adapted to its goals by formulating HCPs  ( for example ,  Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek )  or implementing sustainable forestry techniques  ( for example ,  Collins Pine Co 


-  Despite  cutback in timber use ,  most timber-dependent counties report rising property values ,  increasing timber wages ,  and an overall increase in jobs 


- 11 Tom Powers ,   University of Montana economist ,  recently reported that from 1988 to 1994 ,  jobs in the region grew by 18 percent ,  contrary to dire predictions 


-  An accurate appraisal of the costs of endangered species protection should also consider the external effects of individual development decisions 


-  For example ,   timber sale by the Bureau of Land Management  ( BLM )  in southern Oregon would allow increased logging ,  which the NMFS has determined would adversely affect the nearby Umpqua River ,  the centerpiece of  $36 million sports-fishing industry and the habitat for the threatened Umpqua cutthroat trout 


-  Portions of the river are part of the Wild and Scenic River system ,  which supports rafting ,  sightseeing ,  and ,  most economically important ,  fishing 


- 13 Traditional land-use decision making has often been ineffective in forcing developers to consider the external costs of individual actions 


-  Ironically ,  the decision-making processes of the ESA have provided interactions in which one economic interest can influence the actions of another 


-  ,  Other tangible economic benefits are associated with endangered species protection 


-  Some are direct ,  while others are more generalized benefits of ecosystem protection for which endangered species are useful indicators 


-  Here we highlight five areas that illustrate the broader economic potential of endangered species protection: pharmaceutical products ,  advanced materials ,  food production ,  flood control and drinking water filtration ,  and recreation 


-  Nature has already done the testing; labs can replicate it only at high cost and still not match the number of generations of product variability that evolution has provided 


-  Hence it is more cost-effective to look for new products with benefits to humans in nature than in the artificial ,  costly lab environment 


- 15 Taxol ,   promising treatment for ovarian and breast cancer  ( which kills approximately 40 , 000 women per year )  ,  comes from the bark of the Pacific yew tree ,  found primarily in endangered ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest 


- 16 The rosy periwinkle ,   native of  seriously endangered habitat in Madagascar ,  provides  critical component in the treatment of childhood leukemia and Hodgkins disease 


- 18 The National Cancer Institute is now studying four plant compounds that protect against the replication of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses 


-  Beyond the simple respect for diverse life forms ,  prudence and responsible management would dictate the protection of species for which we can find no current direct use 


-  ,  So valuable are the potential medicinal benefits that pharmaceutical companies are investing in biological diversity protection 


-  For example ,  in 1991 ,  Merck and  Costa Rican biological diversity organization called Instituto National de Biodiversidad  ( INBio )  agreed to catalogue all plants and animals in Costa Rica 


-  In exchange for the right to screen the results of this chemical prospecting ,  Merck pays INBio $1 million up front and royalties on any drug developments; 10 percent of the initial fee and 50 percent of the royalties are used for conservation and biological diversity protection through an arrangement with the Costa Rican government 


- 21 ,  In another example ,  Shaman Pharmaceuticals of San Francisco ,  California ,  sends medical anthropologists to work with indigenous peoples of Central and South America ,  Africa ,  and Southeast Asia to identify plants used for medicinal purposes 


-  In an industry where speed to market can mean success or failure through the control of crucial patent rights ,  Shaman foresees that this targeting will help it bring drugs to market in seven to eight years ,  compared with the industry average of ten to twelve years 


-  For example ,  biopolymers ,  which are stronger and more lightweight and biodegradable than synthetics ,  are derived from microbial systems ,  extracted from higher organisms such as plants ,  or synthesized chemically from basic biological building blocks 


-   wide range of emerging applications include medical materials ,  packaging ,  cosmetics ,  food additives ,  clothing fabrics ,  water treatment chemicals ,  industrial plastics ,  absorbents ,  biosensors ,  and even data storage elements 


-  For example ,   National Research Council report states that salmon hatcheries ,  once thought to be key to survival ,  are pushing many naturally spawning salmon species to extinction by inadequately maintaining the unique biological traits of hundreds of salmon varieties that eventually could become endangered 


-  One ,  the endangered Mexican wild corn ,  is immune to  serious agricultural viral corn disease 


-  Furthermore ,  through cross-fertilization ,  new types of strains can be created as well 


-  For example ,  crossing corn with an endangered grass from Mexico produced  corn strain with increased resistance to Northern leaf blight 


-  In response to the 1993 floods that killed 50 ,  left 70 , 000 homeless ,  and caused farm and property losses in excess of $10 billion ,  researchers and the government are beginning to realize that reserving bottom land for wetland conservation is more cost-effective in controlling floods 


-  Thus far ,  federal expenditures of nearly $250 million have been allocated to buy more than  , 000 bottom-land homes from Midwesterners willing to move 


-  As such ,  endangered species can signal when ecosystems are in crisis ,  much like the canary in the coal mine 


-  For example ,  the threatened Ozark cavefish is an indicator of water quality in the region; efforts to protect the cavefish also provide  valuable monitoring system for protecting the water supply 


-  The needs and desires of an increasingly urban and environmentally concerned population are supplanting the traditional interests of logging ,  mining ,  and grazing 


-  The 1990 census showed that the West  ( the location of nearly all BLM and much of Forest Service land )  has become nearly as urban as the Northeast ,  with more than 83 percent of its residents living in cities 


-  billion-a-year economy and are responsible for millions of jobs in the United States 


-  The number of hunters has similarly increased  percent ,  with  corresponding increase in expenditures of  percent to $12 billion 


- 33 Leading the list ,  birding has become one of North Americas fastest-growing hobbies ,  with enthusiasts spending $18 billion  year on travel and equipment 


- 34 ,  Some corporations and landowners have capitalized on this trend 


-  For example ,  International Paper has implemented  fee-based recreation program in its commercial forests in Texas ,  Louisiana ,  and Arkansas 


-  This shift ,  and the reality that 73 percent of sportsmen consider themselves to be conservationists ,  has led the countrys environmental and conservation groups ,  such as the Sierra Club and the National Audubon Society ,  to form coalitions with hunting and sporting groups 


- 36 Constituting  powerful economic and political interest block ,  many sportsmen now oppose the efforts of logging ,  mining ,  and oil interests to release federal lands to state control for fear that they will be sold and lost to sporting interests 


- 37 ,  Cities and states are also tying economic prosperity to ecosystem protection 


-  It plans to create  wildlife sanctuary that the local community expects will attract bird-watchers and hikers 


- 39 ,  Not all the value of endangered species is tangible 


-  For example ,  economists have priced the annual  ( nonmarket )  benefits of spotted-owl protection in excess of $1 billion ,  which represents the popularity of endangered species protection among the  


- 41 In the same survey ,  63 percent opposed any reduction in protecting endangered species; 59 percent opposed the expansion of logging ,  mining ,  and ranching on public land; and 67 percent were against opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to gas and oil exploration 


- 42 ,  We are not arguing that economics should be the sole criterion for determining the merit of endangered species protection 


-  Clearly ,  the economic costs of protection are often overstated ,  and the direct and indirect economic benefits are often understated 


-  Indeed ,  when viewed more broadly ,  environmental protection is an important component of economic systems ,  both in providing natural capital and in inducing economic transitions that promote efficiency and productivity over the long term 


-  ,  In building the natural resource base of democracy in the United States ,  Thomas Jefferson noted ,  The greatest service which can be rendered any country is to add  useful plant to its culture ,  especially  bread grain 


-  ,  It is inconsistent to argue that we are morally obligated to ensure that future generations are not burdened with massive debt and then not ensure  sound resource base and  stable living environment 


-  Responsible economic foresight necessitates present-day ecosystem management 


-  As plants and animals become scarce ,  the costs of protecting them rise exponentially 


-  While the spotted-owl case was  costly effort to protect an endangered species ,  it was also  mistake that could have been avoided ,  had the agencies and interest groups dealt with the underlying issues early and proactively 


- 44 ,  Including natural capital in the conception of  healthy economy introduces the notion of environmental protection as necessary to economic management 


-  For example ,  declining eagle populations in the 1960s signaled an ecosystem overburdened by DDT spraying 


-  ,  Economic transitions are underway at all times 


-  For example ,  the typewriter industry was virtually eliminated by the computer ,  the compact disc replaced the phonograph album ,  and the dissolution of the Bell system wrought structural changes in the telecommunications industry 


-  With changing federal forest management due to spotted-owl protection ,  price fluctuations have made steel studs an economically viable alternative to framing lumber in new-home construction and have stimulated  new ,  more sustainable market in engineered wood products 


-  ,  The protection of endangered species promotes economic transitions designed to protect the natural resource base 


-  By moving away from  purely extractive view of natural resources ,  it shifts us toward stewardship 


-  For example ,  the diminishing supply of large timber from old-growth forests signals that this resource will eventually be exhausted and that an economic transition may occur 


-  ,  Any assessment of the economic implications of endangered species protection must include the long-term interests of diverse stakeholders to communicate economic transitions and develop alternative strategies consensually 


-  Most people have the common ,  unfortunate perspective that what is good for the other side is bad for us in terms of the economy and the environment 


-  But ,  to the extent that environmental and economic interests weigh issues differently ,  we can find new opportunities by shifting our mind-sets 


- 45 ,  According to  1995 poll ,  69 percent of Americans believe that environmental protection and economic development can work together 


- 46 Some companies are following the trend 


-  million in reduced manufacturing costs 


- 48 ,   shift in mind-set is critical if the ESA is to enhance economic competitiveness rather than diminish it 


-  As Howard Raiffa explains: We must recognize that  lot of disputes are settled by hard-nosed ,  positional bargaining 


-  But efficiently settled? Often not 


-  There may be another carefully crafted settlement that both [parties] might prefer to the settlement they actually achieved 


-  For example: ,  Under sections  and 10 of the ESA ,  federal agencies can negotiate the provisions of their projects to ensure that they do not jeopardize endangered species and can expand this process to private landowners 


-  HCPs are  way for companies to develop plans that serve the interests of the endangered species and the proposal 


-  ,  An enhanced Endangered Species Act that will integrate economic and environmental interests must have three objectives: first ,  it must work within the market system to create individual incentives for protecting biological diversity; second ,  it must foster an inclusive regulatory program that incorporates the interests and needs of all affected parties; and third ,  it must evolve beyond the single-minded focus on individual species and consider the whole ecosystem 


-  Relevant parties in the debate must acknowledge that the environment and the economy are intertwined 


-  ,  To improve the implementation of the ESA ,  we propose:  (  )  the promotion of economic incentives ,  (  )   reduction in the uncertainty facing affected groups ,  (  )  the allocation of adequate resources ,  (  )  more stakeholder involvement in the ESA decision-making process ,  and  (  )   move toward ecosystem-based management 


-  To make the ESA consistent with this ,  we should incorporate policies to harness the power of the marketplace so landowners and corporations find it in their interest to protect biological diversity based on properly adjusted prices 


-  The policies include tax incentives  ( estate ,  property ,  and income )  ,  special trust funds ,  transfer of critical habitat from private to public control ,  and user fees on federal lands 


-  ,  Currently ,  both estate and property taxes are calculated based on lands highest and best-use value ,  which usually involves development 


-  Estate tax reform would allow heirs to defer or avoid applicable estate taxes on inherited land in return for managing their land in ways that benefit endangered species 


-  The agreement could be revocable ,  and the estate taxes would become due when heirs have stopped managing the land as agreed on 


-  For example ,   bill before the 104th  


-  Congress proposed easing inheritance taxes to give landowners incentives to create and maintain wildlife habitats 


- 52 Estate tax reform could also allow the estate  ( or heirs )  to make tax-deductible gifts of land or an interest in land to  qualified organization 


-  ,  Property tax reform could create credits for the cost of land management programs that benefit endangered species on private lands 


-  In  move that has gained the support of both property-rights advocates and environmentalists ,  the Texas legislature recently approved proposition 11 ,   law that allows owners of agricultural land to convert it to wildlife management uses without losing valuable property-tax exemptions 


- 53 Or an income tax deduction could allow for the costs of land improvement to enhance its value as an endangered species habitat 


-  ,  Tax law could also establish  program of tradable permits in endangered species protection 


-  Any landowner wishing to decrease the conservation value of his or her land would do so by offsetting this decrease with credits gained by arranging an equivalent increase elsewhere or by purchasing those credits from another landowner 


-  ,  Two impediments to reestablishing endangered species are  (  )  building adequate local support and  (  )  providing enough funding for management of  particular species 


-  Authorizing  species-specific trust fund with nonfederal cost-sharing requirements could relieve these impediments 


-  Individual and corporate donors could contribute to the protection of particular species ,  as Exxon Corporation has worked with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to establish the international Save the Tiger fund 


-  This technique engages private-sector and local interests in recovery of endangered species while also stimulating the local economy associated with species recovery 


-  All nonprofit organizations and government agencies would be eligible for ecosystem management grants on  matching basis 


-  Such  program would motivate competitive forces and provide flexible funding arrangements 


-  ,  In the few situations in which all or most of the development of  property is precluded because of the needs of an endangered species ,   program could be devised to trade federal lands with low biological diversity value for private land with high biological diversity value ,  thereby shifting some ESA costs back to the government and reducing the burden on private landowners 


-   recently proposed swap involved $380 million in federally owned oil and gas fields and timberland in exchange for thousands of acres of old growth in the Headwaters Forest in California ,  currently owned by Maxxam Inc 


-  Through such trades ,  the Department of the Interior can use its surplus land portfolio ,  including oil and gas subsurface leases ,  as assets in exchange for private-sector lands 


-  By targeting economically valuable federal lands that lack biological diversity ,  the department can sell them to the highest bidder and use the money to benefit endangered species 


-  ,   test of this concept is underway in the Umpqua River Basin ,  which extends from the crest of the Cascade Mountains to the Pacific Ocean 


-  The team will then determine the feasibility of land exchanges between private owners and the government landowners in the area  ( such as the Bureau of Land Management ,  the Forest Service ,  and the state and local counties )  to protect vital areas 


-  Extending this to lands that the other federal agencies manage could bring the total to $11 billion 


- 55 These fees could offset the tax burden for operating expenses and link users and land managers to ensure that managers provide the resources that users most want 


-  ,  Current proposals call for takings legislation to offset the loss of private land value 


-  ( Unlike the terms connotation as harmful to endangered species ,  takings refers to government control of private land 


-  )  We are concerned that providing  subsidy for takings would promote opportunism and excessive costs to state and federal treasuries 


-  Second ,  there are tremendous opportunities for speculation 


-  If  parcel of land is  known habitat for an endangered species ,   developer could obtain the property with the intention of extorting rewards at the expense of the federal or state government 


-  Third ,  takings can often assign property rights to the wrong individual 


-  If clear-cutting is the stated right of the logging industry ,  should loggers be compensated for not creating runoff that damages the downstream salmon fishery? If  developer chooses to fill in  wetland ,  should it be compensated for not destroying fish-breeding grounds ,  natural water-filtering capacity ,  or the ability of the river to absorb rising floodwaters? ,  Each complication affects sport fishermen and downstream municipal water plants and communities 


-  Which party should be assigned the property right of  balanced ecosystem? How can the social costs of habitat destruction be included in development economic formulas? Takings legislation resolves neither issue ,  while market incentives offer an efficient solution to both 


-  To cut funding would undermine their efforts ,  creating costly uncertainty ,  delaying corporate expenditures already allocated ,  and ultimately increasing overall costs 


-  ,  At the same time ,  we know that information on species needs ,  development impacts ,  and the most cost-effective protection methods will change over time 


-  If new information suggests that protection needs to be altered significantly and imposes increased costs ,  the public should share or largely underwrite the burden of that change 


-  ,  Another way to reduce landowners uncertainty is to streamline ESA review procedures where possible 


-  ,  But the primary ways of ensuring more certainty are to  (  )  generate more information about species needs and ecosystems ,  (  )  encourage collaborative problem solving by all participants considering all available information ,  and  (  )  provide adequate resources for local ,  regional and federal implementation 


-  These critical points correct market inefficiencies and involve the business community in species protection 


-  ,  Developing ecosystem management requires adequate funding and resources for generating the scientific and economic information essential to wise investment decisions 


-  And ,  in resolving ESA disputes ,  high-quality information is needed to resolve conflicts 


-  Gap analysis represents state-of-the-art inventory and landscape mapping to identify areas needing protection 


-  The public will be able to learn about identified areas through interactive geographic information systems  ( although it might be necessary to withhold the identity of some parcels to discourage opportunistic collecting of endangered species )  


-  million for the FWSs endangered species program ,  of which only 20 percent was for consulting 


-  On  relative basis ,  this amount is out of proportion with the increased activities that the service is undertaking 


-  Formal project opinions grew by 280 percent ,  and species listings increased by 37 percent  ( see Figure  )  


-  By most accounts ,  The endangered species program is severely short of money and overwhelmed by  backlog of hundreds of imperiled species  and by almost as many lawsuits demanding action to save them 


- 58 ,  It is economically irresponsible to create an endangered species protection program and then starve it of needed resources 


-  An impoverished program is likely to lead to delays ,  uncertainties ,  and impasses ,  which create uncertainty for business ,  which ,  in turn ,  cause more delays and cost overruns 


-  ,  Generated information must incorporate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders 


-  Science-based assessment of alternative conservation strategies is critical ,  but it is also important for affected interests to participate in recovery planning 


-  Advisory boards of affected and interested groups can identify ways to minimize local impact and future impasses 


-  ,  The current process for granting federal protection to species requires no formal involvement of affected groups beyond an opportunity for public comment in the rule-making process 


-  On one level ,  it seems appropriate to limit consideration of  species status to scientific input and assessment 


-  ,  Through HCPs ,  public and private parties can interact and devise plans that are sensitive to local economies while protecting endangered species 


-  ,  Ultimately ,  an overarching federal mandate can help ensure that interested parties negotiate 


-  Multiparty negotiation can function in an incentive structure that encourages parties to bargain in good faith and seek creative solutions 


-  In the many negotiations already conducted under the ESA ,  it is clear that the absolute mandate to protect species helped motivate various public and private interests to simultaneously protect environmental and economic concerns 


-  ,  In many ways ,  this approach parallels that of other market-based mechanisms to pollution control ,  in which government standards set binding objectives but affected interests determine how to reach those standards 


-  Having clear performance measures and flexibility will yield the most efficient ,  effective strategies for achieving economic and environmental objectives simultaneously 


-  ,   new type of resource management ,  called ecosystem management ,  incorporates many themes  science-based decision making ,  stakeholder involvement ,  articulation of social values ,  and long-term planning 


-  Ecosystem management attempts to shift from  single-minded focus on individual species to  broad-based focus on regional resource management 


-  Endangered species management is useful as an indicator of ecosystems in crisis ,  but the ultimate objective is  stable ecosystem 


-  Hence it is necessary to protect species as components of ecosystems and as  proxies for ecosystem integrity 


-  ,  Early research on ecosystem-based approaches to resource management suggests that they may be appropriate for the future 


- 61 They are regional in scale ,  emphasize collaborative decision making by  full range of public and private interests ,  and seek to balance economic and environmental concerns 


-  Their ability to focus public and private resources on shared problems and work through conflicts that have often led to impasse can yield substantial efficiencies for all parties 


-  ,  One way to move toward an ecosystem-based approach might be to delegate aspects of ESA implementation to state and local officials 


- 62 Many states already have sensitive-species programs underway that might result in program efficiencies and more sensitive ,  local decision making 


-  But other parties ,  including nongovernmental organizations ,  can play  role in consortia to protect valuable ecosystems 


-  These consortia must have the capacity ,  motivation ,  and authority to implement endangered species programs 


-  For example ,  the current ESA state-grants program could promote the regional consortias ecosystem-level action with  provision to delegate program authority 


-  Providing ways for citizens to sue guarantees that such innovative approaches are monitored for effective implementation 


-  ,  Ecosystem-based approaches to species management ,  underway in many places ,  are likely to represent the future of natural resource management in the United States 


- 63 For example ,  the Georgia Conservancy has proposed  statewide watershed protection project centered on clusters of community-based groups in fifteen major watersheds in Georgia ,  while the Conservation Fund has formed  voluntary land-protection program along Georgias Ebenezer Creek 


-  In Maine ,  three large paper companies  Baskahegan ,  Champion International ,  and Georgia Pacific  have banded together to form the Salmon Habitat and River Enhancement Project  ( SHARE )  to protect the habitat of the Atlantic salmon 


-  And landowners in southwest Florida are joining to voluntarily protect more than  million acres that make up the habitat for the endangered Florida panther 


-  These kinds of locally based ,  public-private partnerships will move resource management debates from  reactive ,  crisis mode to  more proactive ,  deliberative community approach 


-  ,  When first written ,  the ESA was intended as  policy of last resort ,  in which species deserving intensive care received protection 


-  But our understanding of resource management ,  policy implementation ,  and the interrelationship between the economy and the environment have evolved considerably 


-  Ultimately ,  the goal of endangered species protection represents the goal of the entire framework 


-  Rather than pursuing environmental goals based on the fluctuations of best available technology or most practicable economic calculations ,  endangered species protection has the goal of maintaining valuable ,  productive ecosystems 


-  By developing management plans that are guided by the objective of balancing local ,  regional ,  and state economies with the health of the ecosystem on which they are based ,  the ESA seeks the end-point of all environmental objectives: economic and environmental sustainability 


-  ,  Species protection is not only for ourselves but for future generations 


-  As stewards ,  we can enhance the benefits of our actions ,  minimize the costs ,  limit the hidden externalities ,  maintain our natural capital ,  and avoid the precipitative effects of boom-and-bust economic transitions only if we promote improvements in the ESA process 


-  One way to be more proactive is to move toward ecosystem-scale management that includes human populations while still providing  safety net for the most endangered organisms 


-  By including the human population ,  the ESA process must become more inclusive and negotiations more creative 


-  By taking  broad look at all aspects of this process  economic ,  environmental ,  and political  cooperative ecosystem management is the best way to foster joint gains in environmental protection and economic growth over the long term 


- Let us assume that mastering the capabilities to learn and to collaborate  to manage knowledge and relationships  is the foundation for competitive success in the future 


-  Where should we turn for guidance in developing these skills? Which are the benchmarks ,  the best-practice leaders in the knowledge business ,  the firms whose source of competitive advantage resides in their capacity to tap the collective intelligence of members and to work together to create value for customers? ,  Those firms ,  we argue here ,  are professional service firms  ( PSFs )  they are lawyers ,  accountants ,  doctors ,  consultants ,  and investment bankers 


-  They represent the kinds of inverted organizations that have captured managers interest 


-  With their flat structures ,  service-oriented workforce ,  and participative decision processes ,  PSFs can provide  model toward which larger ,  more hierarchical organizations can turn for guidance as they become leaner ,  quicker ,  and more flexible 


-  PSFs represent  pure form of knowledge-based business when many leading business theorists are arguing that the management of collective knowledge and the ability to work together to translate that knowledge into customer value are the critical competencies for the future 


-  ,  We recently visited three leading professional service firms ,  each privately held partnerships recognized as outstanding performers in investment banking ,  law ,  and medicine ,  respectively 


-  We left these conversations believing that the organizations had mastered the capabilities for collaboration and learning that created value for the firms beyond the value of each individuals skills 


-  Those capabilities would allow them to sustain their success despite the significant changes in each field and provide  needed prototype for all organizations struggling to enhance and utilize their knowledge to broaden and deepen their customer relationships 


-  From our conversations ,  we framed  set of propositions about the similar ways in which all three firms achieved those capabilities ,  by creating  generative cycle of mutually reinforcing ,  self-sustaining employee and client development 


-  ,  This generative cycle succeeds despite the other characteristics that have made PSFs among the most difficult firms to manage  contentiousness and self-interest ,  fiefdoms ,  insensitivity to clients ,  exploitation of staff professionals ,  and slow ,  inefficient decision making 


-  How could the firms we studied bypass these obstacles to create new models of management for all organizations? Our thesis is that the capabilities that the generative cycle of reinforcing behaviors creates allowed them to minimize and overcome the dysfunctional behaviors often accompanying diffused ,  democratized decision making 


-  These behaviors include the self-interest that sometimes dominates both firmwide and client-specific interests and consensus-based processes that can hinder action 


-  The elements of the generative cycle that overcome these obstacles are specific capabilities in the development of individual professionals and clients that fuse the professionals interests with the firms interests 


-  Hence ,  there is significant interest in organizational learning in writings by both practitioners and academics 


-  Nowhere is the potential strategic value of learning more evident than in professional services 


-  Yet individual learning is merely  precondition for the kind of organizational learning that the partners in the PSFs we studied saw as the source of their competitive advantage 


-  Next ,   capacity for collaborative learning unleashes the creativity involved in joint exploration of solutions that transcend technical boundaries and define tomorrows possibilities 


-  Even the ability to collaborate to achieve single-loop learning of an incremental nature is valuable; transformed by leveraging diverse perspectives into double-loop learning that reexamines fundamental assumptions ,  it can add tremendous value ,  especially in changing environments 


-  Processes for recruiting ,  developing ,  and retaining professional staff develop  capability for collaborative learning ,  which ,  in turn ,  produces valued outcomes for clients ,  which further support professional development 


-  Taken alone ,  none of the elements of the cycle are remarkable; in conjunction ,  however ,  they produce extraordinary results  ( see Figure  )  


-  The key elements of the model are  (  )  the process through which ,  and the context within which ,   firm enhances and extends individual expertise through collaboration ,  and  (  )  the process through which  firm leverages individual learning to create  capacity for collaborative learning 


-  Despite the pressure ,  due to their growth ,  to hire many people at the same time ,  one partner spoke of the importance of hiring candidates carefully: ,  The quality of the person hired is the single most important thing in my mind 


-  Again ,   go back to the business principles  putting the clients interest first ,  operating as  team ,  making sure that you subordinate your own interests to the firms 


-  ,  All three firms looked for analytic talent to do the technical work ,  human qualities to do the relationship work ,  and entrepreneurial instincts to do the organization-building work 


-  ,  Analytic talent was not hard to find and identify among the many bright prospects seeking positions at the firms 


-  The qualities for the relationship work   combination of interpersonal skills and personal qualities of integrity and respect  were essential to developing what one partner called team consciousness 


-  For example ,  the partners at the medical firm ,  in looking for this quality ,  asked support staff who answered prospective physicians phone calls to comment on the respect with which they were treated by the candidates 


-  The firms thought entrepreneurial instincts were manifested in an inquisitive ,  energetic mind that saw and recognized opportunity ,  skills likely to translate that opportunity into new business and the motivation to do so 


-  ,  There was also  high degree of consistency between the qualities the firms looked for when promoting people to partner and those they looked for in new hires ,  although the emphasis gradually moved toward the entrepreneurial and relationship work as they expected the technical skills had become  given 


-  The firms expected partners ,  in particular ,  to move from merely working with others to energizing others by example and interactions 


-   law partner asked us ,  Isnt one of the great tests whether or not the people that you care most about in the organization will be motivated or demotivated by seeing an individual made partner? ,  Another important criterion for partnership selection was  capacity to continue to grow and learn 


-  ,  Thus the selection process began with clear criteria that focused on qualities designed to make collaboration work in the long term: capable ,  trustworthy colleagues ,  with high potential for personal growth ,  who were oriented toward working together and committed to thinking ,  at an organizationwide level ,  about the firms business 


-  One founding partner in the law firm remarked: ,  Ive always viewed the objective of the firm as identifying what is the highest and best use of the people that you have 


-  ,  This willingness to invest was ,  in turn ,  based on beliefs about the reciprocal commitment of the individual to the firm and the benefits to the firm as  result 


-  That sets things on  very even plane ,  in terms of cooperating ,  interacting ,  and cross-selling ,  which is very crucial 


-  ,  Senior partners willingness to personally invest in the growth of new hires was always present 


-  One investment banker remarked: ,  It has to be constant talking about this ,  constantly going from abstractions down to day-to-day examples so people can see how the core principles apply 


-  In terms of things like integrity or conflict avoidance ,  managers have to give constant seminars on day-to-day work 


-  Not in  classroom setting ,  but in brainstorming with their younger associates on how  particular situation was handled 


-  ,  Moreover ,  professional development at the PSFs did not end when  person became partner 


-  The responsibility to maintain value remains throughout  career 


-  An investment banker commented: ,  You cannot create an environment in which someone can sit and use up space ,  if you will ,  and not really add significant value 


-  Senior managements willingness to retire partners who are not contributing at the level they once did is  very important ingredient in adding to the enthusiasm and incentive of the younger people 


-  Everyone here is evaluated by people senior to them ,  junior to them ,  and their peers ,  one investment banking partner explained ,  and partners have the same kind of evaluation process 


-   senior physician described its purpose: It doesnt go into your file or into your compensation; its just  tool for learning ,  for asking How am  doing as  provider of caring service? ,  Throughout development ,  firm members believed they were both learners and teachers: according to one law partner ,  top performers and role models were elevated to  platform ,  not  pedestal ,  where others could join because everyone was expected to help elevate each others performance 


-   senior investment banking partner described the relationship between the development experiences of professionals and the ability to retain them: ,  People have to feel that they are being assessed fairly and given thoughtful feedback ,  and that the people who are responsible for their careers are genuinely helping them develop their potential 


-   founding partner in the law firm captured this pervasive theme: ,  The way an institution becomes excellent is if the partners like being partners 


-  If its just the career path they chose or they feel protected by  strong institution and have  good income ,  thats not only bad for them  its terrible for the institution 


-  ,  Loyalty developed from the firms developmental focus but was also due to  sense of stewardship   belief in and commitment to something that each partner saw as meaningful beyond his or her own interests  that encompassed clients ,  colleagues ,  and the firm itself 


-   retired investment banking partner likened it to preserving Buckingham Palace for future generations: ,  It wasnt only our firm 


-  Weve always had that attitude toward building ,  growing ,  and protecting the firm 


-  One physician recalled his initial interview at the medical center ,  almost twenty years earlier: ,  I remember distinctly  three-hour conversation that  had with an oncologist whod been president of the group for years 


-  We arent just here to see patients and send bills and make the most money that we can make 


-  These values created  sense of unity and coherence that simplified the complexities inherent in working within the firms often complicated organizational structures 


-  The director of the medical center explained: ,  Most of our decision making is consensus and not voting 


-  That doesnt mean that everybody agrees with everything ,  but it means there is sufficient understanding and dialogue so people see the broader picture 


-  ,  At each firm ,  respect for others opinions was key 


-  An investment banker remarked: ,  Its very ,  very important that people here respect each others opinion and consider it ,  and that they work toward consensus and things dont get polarized 


-  Even when  majority of the executive committee feels strongly about  subject ,  if theres  minority position thats not irrational and has  strong base of intellectual support ,  thats usually the opinion that sways ,  even at the risk of losing the competitive advantage of moving very quickly 


-  ,  Partners frequently referred to their concern about the inability to act quickly ,  but they saw it as  necessary trade-off to protect dialogue 


-  An investment banker said: ,  In  partnership ,  you need the goodwill of the other partners to make the right kinds of decisions 


-  If you build consensus the right way ,  youre potentially stronger ,  and it affects the way that the whole place operates 


-  ,  The quality of collaboration resulting from the consensus process paid dividends ,  as the complexity of products expanded 


-  The managing partner of the investment bank explained: ,  A large proportion of our products and services requires more teamwork than we could have imagined five ,  ten ,  or fifteen years ago 


-  If every time you deliver  product to people ,  you have turf warfare ,  sharp elbows ,  and transfer-pricing debates ,  you will be much slower ,  your reaction time will be much slower than competitors ,  and youre on the slippery slope to failure 


-  It doesnt serve any customers best interest to sit around haggling about how  dollar gets sliced up around the firm 


-   few were more interesting 


-  ,  For partners ,  shared values ,  sense of enjoyment ,  stewardship ,  equitable reward system ,  and inclusive decision processes together created significant barriers to exit 


-  They produced an environment in which an individual could use the larger network to reach outcomes not possible when acting alone or within less connected ,  less capable firms 


-  This ,  in turn ,  created marketplace outcomes that made the relationship financially rewarding and professionally satisfying for all 


-  These capabilities become strategically significant because they contribute superior value to clients ,  are not easily matched by rivals ,  and speed the firms ongoing adaptation to environmental change 


-  They ,  of course ,  provide the more standardized services as well ,  but none of the partners we spoke with felt that their firms enjoyed significantly superior advantages in these areas; it was in handling complexity that they felt they excelled 


-  The law firm ,  for example ,  was known for integrating product liability issues with its bankruptcy practice; the physician practice ,  for integrating across all its medical specialties 


-  We identified issues running from pure litigation strategy ,  to bankruptcy considerations ,  to civil and criminal forfeiture law ,  tax law ,  and corporate securities 


-  We were successful in part because we brought all those resources together and focused them on one person ,  as opposed to sending six people to the  


-  ,  Thus the central asset of the firms is not the individual technical expertise of their members; that is merely  precondition at these firms 


-  Rather ,  the collective wisdom of their multidisciplinary teams sets them apart 


-  ,  The capacity to work together rested on an individual willingness to learn and  belief that no one had all the answers 


-  When collaboration facilitates learning at organizational and individual levels ,  the solutions tend to be more innovative and more integrated 


-  Many researchers have argued that shared problem solving leads to greater creativity 


-  Otherwise ,  the ability to create new knowledge is limited by organizational routines ,  individual expertise ,  and biased interpretation of the potential value of new possibilities 


-  ,  Enjoyment in the work itself that we spoke of earlier also seemed to contribute to members willingness to engage in creative conversation 


-  One lawyer remarked: ,  The people working here find the work challenging and interesting 


-  As  result ,  if you approach them with  novel or interesting way to handle  problem ,  they start off by being interested in it 


-  Theres support for people developing new practices even though it takes them away from doing the things that produce good short-term results 


-  ,  The president of the medical center expressed  similar view: ,  We give people time to focus on their work 


-  ,  The capability for collaboration ,  extended to  capability for organizational learning ,  is nurtured through professional development processes and leveraged into value for clients 


-  The breadth of expertise that the firms made seamlessly available to clients allowed them to develop broader ,  deeper relationships with them 


-  If you can do that ,  you create  different relationship with your client 


-  Specialists are seen as specialists who can be replaced with other specialists 


-  We want to become advisers to our clients 


-  One investment banker remarked: ,  Weve tried very hard to have  relationship approach and  transaction capability 


-  So every client has someone ,  usually  group ,  but certainly one person who is charged with managing that relationship and knows everything about the client and its needs ,  objectives ,  and idiosyncrasies 


-  That relationship manager or team is our first and foremost line of attack so the client never sees business units or P&Ls or departments or divisions 


-  All the client sees is  team of experts ,  each of whom is trying to contribute  piece to the puzzle 


-  An investment banker said: In this firm ,  its more difficult to try to establish or protect or defend or segregate turf than it is to forget about all those issues and just say ,  Heres the problem 


-  We have  triple-layered matrix management system 


-  By grabbing this process ,  we were better able to create the chain reaction that occurs when  woman has symptomatic breast problems 


-  The best clients for  professional services firm ,  we suggest ,  are those with the most complex problems who are willing to invest in state-of-the-art solutions and ,  in so doing ,  push each professional to new levels of expertise 


-  One law partner described the relationship between his clients issues and his professional development: ,  My goal is to be recognized as someone at the top ,  at the cutting edge of the business reorganization and bankruptcy practice 


-  In addition ,  because the number of competitors able to solve new ,  complex problems effectively and efficiently is more limited than the number offering standardized solutions ,  the risk of margin erosion is less 


-  In much the same way as in the high-tech industry ,   given firm can avoid commoditization of its products only if it can continually create enhanced solutions that deliver  better price/performance ratio to its clients 


-  ,   firms ability to enhance its capability to deliver these kinds of solutions depends on clients willingness to bring it problems for which either current solutions are inadequate or no solution exists 


-   senior partner in the law firm explained: ,  My firms clients tend to develop new kinds of problems that ,  if youre intellectually interested ,  constantly reinvigorate the field 


-  ,  The collaborative capacity for boundary crossing is more difficult for competitors to replicate than individually-based expertise and ,  hence ,  is considerably more valuable not only to customers but also to the firm itself in sustaining advantage 


-  Development processes based on mentoring cannot be grafted onto firms with uninterested partners 


-  The most gifted professionals will always have many options to go elsewhere 


- 12 Talented people can always be wooed from one firm to another 


-  ,  Another benefit of the generative cycle is the increasingly valuable ,  enhanced ability for successfully adapting to  changing marketplace 


-  These firms are Mintzbergs adhocracies ,  which bring together individuals pursuing their own professional interests ,  whose allegiance to the firm is sublimated to their allegiance to their profession and own interests 


-  Here ,  again ,  the capability for collaborative learning that we noted in the firms in our study benefits their management and their clients 


-  The quality of the relationships across the formal structure allows for the continual reconfiguration of work groups ,  as demands necessitate 


-  Because of their mind-sets and their T-shaped skills ,  individuals move in and out of these webs with an alacrity not found in their more narrowly focused competitors 


-  ,  The same context and processes that sustain collaboration and learning about client issues also sustain it for internal management issues 


-  The capacity for collaboration relies on mutual respect ,  openness ,  and trust; on an ability and desire to maintain an open dialogue; on shared goals and an interest in  common stewardship; and on systems that foster and reward teamwork 


-  The capacity for learning relies on different contextual factors   willingness to be self-critical ,   belief that one doesnt have all the answers ,  and  commitment to lifelong development 


-  Taken together ,  these qualities create an institutional capacity for flexibility and responsiveness that greatly enhances the firms ability to have  sense of their future ,  to be patient in searching for consensus ,  and to reengineer themselves as necessary to adapt to changing circumstances 


- 15 Such communities are fundamentally and simultaneously concerned with producing both practical outcomes for customers and learning for members 


-  The nature of learning ,  proponents of this view contend ,  requires participation in doing ,  shared perspectives about doing ,  and mutual development of both the individuals and the collectives capabilities in the process 


-  ,  Thus  business organization as  community of practice is one held together by  shared concern for both the outcomes it achieves for customers and its members personal development and learning 


-  In fact ,  it sees the two as inseparable in that increased capabilities at the organizational level flow from development at the individual level 


-  ,  Much of the power of the community-of-practice metaphor lies in its ability to move beyond the traditional dichotomies that we have often accepted in management  the decoupling of who we are from what we do or of the work from the person ,  the juxtaposition of shareholders and employees ,  and the tension between caring for and respecting individuals and insisting they change 


-  Perhaps most prominently ,   focus on  community of practice refuses to see individuals interests at odds with those of the organization 


-  Yet ,  in doing so ,  community of practice challenges the organization to find the shared purpose that links individual development with institutional direction in  far more reciprocal way than the old dictum of whats good for the firm is good for the employee 


-  Historically ,  communities of practice have evolved; no one has consciously created them 


-  They resist management as we generally think of it; instead they require value-driven leadership by members 


-  Like so many other attempts to implement fundamentally value-driven initiatives  ( total quality management is  good example )  ,  piecemeal attempts at imitating its techniques will fail 


-  It is the whole cloth that one must purchase ,  and this requires embracing  set of values that have not traditionally been part of business 


-  They create value for their clients by caring more about client issues than internal politics ,  sharing their knowledge with each other as efficiently as possible ,  and constantly looking for better ways to solve their clients tough problems 


-  ,  This should be simple ,  except that firms have gotten it so wrong for so long by hiring people without concern for their long-term fit with the businesss principles ,  by treating them as commodities ,  by denying them  voice in decisions that affect them ,  and by giving them reason to leave for more lucrative offers 


-  Firms have failed customers in similar ways  by caring more for their own comfort than client issues ,  by guarding turf and creating inefficient hand-offs ,  and by targeting the easy problems and convenient answers 


-  Such  process begins ,  we believe ,  with value-driven leaders willing to fundamentally reexamine organizational capabilities ,  values ,  and practices and ask ,  What kind of firm are we committed to being? ,  The PSFs traditional areas of weakness  narrow specialists who see only their own solutions ,  self-centered egoists unwilling or unable to collaborate with colleagues ,  fragmented perspectives and interest group politics that stymie institutional change  are the areas in which the firms studied have found their sources of sustainable advantage 


-  The people in the firms have the self-confidence and independence that such demanding professional work with clients demands ,  yet they remain willing to acknowledge their need to learn from and rely on each other 


-  They encourage calculated risk taking and innovation ,  yet they do not sacrifice quality ,  reliability ,  speed ,  or efficiency 


-  Most of the extant frameworks in strategic management implicitly assume  benign environment that is simple and not very dynamic 


-  Yet ,  recent advances in technology ,  coupled with  global political climate that is favorable to free markets ,  have made parts of many industries such as financial services ,  health care ,  and transportation more turbulent 


-  For firms competing in these industries ,  the organizational set ,  or the number of competitive forces that  firm faces ,  has expanded ,  and technological innovations have accelerated the rate of change 


-  The larger the firms organizational set ,  the greater the complexity that it faces 


-  The existing models of competitive strategy do not help firms seeking to compete in such environments 


-   offer an alternate framework that conceives of competitive strategy as flexible commitments   paradoxical blend of early commitments  ( so vital for competitive success )  and timely exits  ( crucial for managing risks )  


-  ,   must note at the outset that not all Infocom firms experience turbulence; some are in simple ,  less dynamic niches 


-  Market leaders must face and cope with turbulence by reconceptualizing strategy ,  sharing the responsibility for strategy more broadly within the firm ,  and focusing on organizational capabilities as the real source of competitive advantage 


-  ,  There are four major clusters of Infocom industries: information providers ,  information processors ,  communication providers ,  and communication support  ( see Figure  )  


-  Information providers include firms in the media ,  film ,  music ,  and publishing industries that are primarily concerned with creating and assembling new information 


-  These firms also seek to add value by selectively archiving some of this information for future use 


-  Information processors are beginning to focus their attention on voice and moving images as well 


-  Communication providers ,  which move information ,  include transporters of voice and data  the telephone companies  ( including cellular telephone operators )  and distributors of books ,  movies ,  and other entertainment software  and the broadcasting and cable TV companies 


-  Another cluster ,  communications support ,  includes firms that provide equipment and services to support the communication providers 


-  The growing political trend toward deregulation and market liberalization has been another contributing factor 


-  In the United States ,  for example ,  the Telecommunications Act of 1996 promises to eliminate the barriers that currently separate the communication providers in Infocom 


-  ,  Technological advances have lowered many entry and mobility barriers that have historically protected Infocom industries 


-  Information will be available via  communication utility in much the same way that electricity is today 


-  The provision of this new service will call for the seamless integration of various information forms like newspapers ,  books ,  scientific and business information ,  and  broadband ,  interactive communication channel 


-  ,  Semiconductor devices can now process high-speed images and manage data communication interfaces at hundreds and thousands of megabits per second 


-  As technological performance rises ,  the price of semiconductor devices continues to drop 


-  Integration density and performance per chip has doubled every one and  half years ,  while prices have remained virtually the same 


-  Trends show that ,  every seven years ,  the cost of processing has fallen by  factor of ten 


-  Tasks that only large mainframes costing millions of dollars performed twenty years ago can now be done on machines costing  few thousand dollars; perhaps in another twenty years ,  the same power will cost only  few hundred dollars 


-  This impressive improvement in performance ,  coupled with falling prices ,  has made it commercially feasible to extend digitization of information beyond data to include voice ,  video ,  and moving images 


-  Televisions ,  on the other hand ,  have been part of many home computer setups and integral to computer-game configurations 


-  Soon ,   single telecomputer will be  fax-phone ,  radio ,   high-definition TV ,  an audio and video recorder/player ,  an image copier ,  and  computer 


-  Recent developments in Internet-related technologies will make this battle even more interesting 


-  The telecomputer of the future might actually be  cheap device without large data storage and processing capabilities that relies instead on the Internet 


-  Computer companies such as IBM and Hitachi are competing with Alcatel and AT&T for high-end telecommunication equipment like the asynchronous transfer mode  ( ATM )  switch ,  and consumer electronics firms such as Sony and Philips compete with the telecommunication equipment manufacturers on telephones ,  answering machines ,  and low-end telecommunication systems 


-  Frame relay and cell transfer technologies transmit  mixture of image ,  data ,  and voice through self-healing ,  highly reliable networks 


-  They are capable of providing  bandwidth-on-demand service 


-  B-ISDN  ( broadband ISDN )  has already enhanced the capacity of telephone networks to carry data 


-  Newer technologies like the asymmetric digital subscriber line  ( ADSL )  make it possible to squeeze even more capacity from existing twisted-pair telephone wiring 


-  The cost of producing  meter of fiber has dropped dramatically from $11 


-  Also ,  technological advances will allow wireless networks to emerge faster and offer the same capacity that wireline services offer today 


-  ,  Microsoft is an example of  firm that has exploited the wide range of strategic alternatives that are now available in Infocom 


-  The company began as an information processor ,  specializing in operating and applications systems software  ( see Figure  )  


-  For example ,  it has forged alliances with Sega ,  the video game maker ,  and DreamWorks SKG ,  the innovative film producer ,  to gain special access to distinct information content 


-  Microsoft has alliances with communication providers on interactive TV and various on-line services 


-  Bill Gates also has an interest in Craig McCaws ambitious new venture ,  Teledesic ,  that will create  constellation of 840 low-altitude satellites that transmit signals from any point on the planet with the speed and capacity of fiber-optic cable 


-  Their competitive environment has become more complex 


-  Products or companies that get ahead in such  market eventually run into limitations and reach  predictable equilibrium of prices and market shares 


-  The evolution of the microcomputer industry provides an illustration of Arthurs thesis  ( see Figure  )  


-  Tandy ,  Commodore ,  and Apple all offered complete machines ,  but Apples user-friendly operating system gave it an early lead over its competitors 


-  ,  IBMs name recognition gave it early market penetration ,  and the growing base of IBM/DOS users encouraged independent software vendors to develop new application software for the IBM PC 


-  The greater variety of application software encouraged additional users to try the IBM PC ,  which led to  virtuous cycle of more users and more application software ,  making it the industry standard ,  despite Apples arguably more user-friendly operating system 


-  As the price of the cloned PCs started dropping ,  more users flooded the market 


-  This ,  in turn ,  encouraged Intel ,  Microsoft ,  and the independent software vendors to set an ambitious development strategy ,  increasingly independent of IBM 


-  The availability of user-friendly applications further boosted PC sales ,  but now the hardware itself had become  mere commodity 


-  The World Wide Web and its system software could become the next dominant platform ,  superseding the personal computer and its operating system 


-  ,  The digitization of information allows information content providers and communication conduit companies to add value in several ways  ( Figure  shows three such approaches for  content provider )  


-  Some firms have focused on speed by providing near-instant business intelligence on  wide range of items from stock market performance ,  to patent and other scientific information ,  to presentations at public conferences 


-  Finally ,   number of innovations seek to extend the half-life of information ,   


-  ,  how long it is valued ,  through  range of archival products from technologically freshened movie classics to new databases stored conveniently and inexpensively on CD-ROMs for personal use 


-  Similarly ,  the communication providers and their respective support companies will compete to control the value added to the communication conduits  ( see Figure  )  


-  Satellite broadcasting ,  for example ,  is  one-to-many communication conduit that is not specific to any viewer 


-  This is ,  for example ,  the intent of the Teledesic project 


-   conduit is versatile if it can carry all forms of information  voice ,  data/ image ,  and video 


-  But technological advances have made it capable of handling data/image transmission and ,  more recently ,  even video signals ,  using new signal-compression technologies 


-  ATM switch technology breaks messages into packets and stuffs data packets into spaces between voice and video packets ,  thus expanding the carrying capacity of  telephone line 


-   conduit is interactive when it allows two-way communication 


-  Future technological advances are expected to remove this limitation 


-  The communication support companies ,  on the other hand ,  prefer to create these features in CPEs 


-  By going directly to the end user ,  the equipment manufacturers can bypass the power of well-entrenched communication providers 


-  The Internet is hardware independent and equally accessible to any terminal ,  whether  PC or Mac 


-  It also liberates the user from the costs and hassles of frequent software updates; the user has access to the latest version of the software on the Internet 


-  Industry watchers see  communications network that will become the primary repository of data and applications software; all  user will need for access is  $500 terminal ,  which even the game machine companies Nintendo and Sega can make 


-  Andrew Grove and Bill Gates ,  whose strategies have been aimed at increasing the power of the stand-alone desktop computer ,  point out that the low-cost ,  high-bandwidth ,  interactive communication pipelines needed to make the Internet  serious threat will be unavailable to most users globally ,  even by the year 2000 


-  ,  Actors in each Infocom cluster have different visions for its future 


-  ,  Falling entry and mobility barriers ,  increasing returns to scale ,  and frequent innovations are trends that researchers have observed in other industries 


-  DAveni defines hypercompetition ,   condition similar to the turbulence  described ,  as an environmental phenomenon in which competitive advantages are rapidly created and eroded because of dynamic strategic interactions in four areas of competition:  (  )  cost and quality ,  (  )  timing and know-how ,  (  )  strongholds ,  and  (  )  deep pockets 


-  ,  In  hypercompetitive environment ,  advantages due to  low-cost position or superior features  ( what DAveni calls quality )  are constantly challenged 


-  In the case of Infocom ,  technological innovation allows features to improve constantly even as costs drop 


-  Traditional barriers built around switching costs and captive distribution are being challenged by an open information architecture and access to  broadband communication utility 


-  DAveni sees hypercompetition as  desirable stop on the inevitable descent to perfect competition: ,  Thus ,  even though perfect competition is treated as the equilibrium state in static economic models ,  it is neither  desired state nor  sustainable state from the perspective of corporations seeking profits 


-  They would prefer low and moderate levels of competition but often settle for hypercompetitive markets because the presence of  small number of aggressive foreign corporations wont cooperate enough to allow the old ,  more genteel levels of competition that existed in the past 


-  Hypercompetition assumes  less complex environment by contrast ,  involving conflicts within and across the four areas of cost and quality ,  timing and know-how ,  strongholds ,  and deep pockets 


-  Some popular frameworks for formulating competitive strategy assume an even more benign environment  ( see Table  )  


-  ,  Porters framework is useful only if the competitive forces represented by competitors ,  suppliers ,  buyers ,  and substitutes are relatively stable and independent 


-  Then  company can find an appropriate strategy for each industry configuration and erect the necessary barriers for protecting this strategy 


-  ,  The traditional sources of competitive advantage  economies of scale ,  product differentiation ,  capital investments ,  switching costs ,  access to distribution channels ,  and government policy  have all lost their importance as barriers to competition in Infocom 


-  ,  Hamel and Prahalad argue that the role of strategy should be not to accommodate an existing industry structure but rather to change it 


- 11 They see the role of competitive innovation as identifying the orthodoxy in an incumbents strategy and redefining the terms of engagement to exploit this orthodoxy 


-  Of particular relevance to the Infocom industry is their example of  poorly resourced competitor ,  Canon ,  which successfully attacked Xeroxs dominance in the office products industry 


-  The Canon innovation ,  at least initially ,  was to offer the same or reduced functionality at substantially lower prices than the industry leaders 


-  Other competing frameworks question the determinism implicit in this approach and focus instead on the firm  its competencies ,  organizational capabilities ,  and ,  above all ,  its managerial ingenuity  as the key drivers of its strategy 


-  DAveni ,  therefore ,  prescribes  strategy that is continually seeking to change the rules of the game ,  even when  firm is successful and ahead of its competitors 


-  He extends the Hamel and Prahalad notion of competitive innovation to  continual process rather than  one-time breakthrough 


-  However ,  in departing from Hamel and Prahalad ,  he proposes that  firm should carefully guard its strategic intent from its competitors and seek instead to confuse them 


-  The primary driver of strategy is strategic soothsaying and the anticipation of future customer needs through  constant monitoring of stakeholder  ( especially customer )  satisfaction 


-  First ,  it assumes that strategic soothsaying is possible ,  and second ,  it assumes that competitive battles are won or lost by the firms own actions in the four areas of competition: cost and quality ,  timing and know-how ,  strongholds ,  and deep pockets 


- 13 While DAveni is right in pointing out that competitive advantage in  hyper-competitive environment is fleeting ,  his belief that  firm can continuously move from one advantage to the next is misplaced 


-  Arthur points out that ,  while corporate maneuvering  ( an economists term for strategy )  can be helpful ,  winners in  turbulent environment are also picked by external circumstances and luck 


- 16 ,  Companies cannot manage turbulence ,  but they can cope with it 


-  ,  The three elements of my proposed framework are: reconceptualizing strategy ,  sharing the responsibility for strategy more broadly within the firm ,  and focusing on organizational capabilities as the real source of competitive advantage 


-  On the face of it ,  the idea seems to contradict the previous theorizing on first-mover advantages 


-  In their thoughtful survey on first-mover advantages  ( and disadvantages )  ,  Lieberman and Montgomery note that  first-mover strategy has severe disadvantages when there is the possibility to free ride on an innovation ,  the technological and commercial uncertainties are high ,  and technology or customer needs are fluid 


- 18 This seems to apply to the Infocom industries 


-  The fundamental support for  first-mover strategy comes from this ever-present threat of substitution 


-  ,   strategy is viable if it can be defended by distinct resources 


- 19 In manufacturing industries ,  the primary resources that are typically used to gain competitive advantage are tangible and intangible assets ,  which are difficult to either procure or imitate 


-  For example ,  Caterpillar used its brand name ,  manufacturing capacities ,  sales network ,  and worldwide spare-parts distribution and servicing capabilities as distinct barriers that kept competition at bay 


-  In the earlier PC industry example ,  IBM succeeded in displacing Apple by introducing  new PC architecture 


-  Compaq ,   player with substantially lower assets ,  displaced IBM ,  again through an innovative product design 


-  The more recent challenges to the PC come not from asset-rich competitors but from industry upstarts like Sun and Netscape 


-  ,  Unlike the competitive context of manufacturing industries ,  in which the challenger avoids head-on competition until it has assembled an asset base comparable to that of the industry leader ,  challengers in the Infocom sectors do not show any such courtesy to the leader 


-  Each successive challenger takes the industry leader head-on by offering  product or service that offers the same or better performance at  substantially lower price 


-  Canon ,  for example ,  launched its inkjet printers despite the damage to the companys dominant position in laser printers 


-  First movers are not always guaranteed success 


-  Prodigy ,  for example ,  was the first to offer on-line services but has since lost to America Online and CompuServe 


-  In addition to being  first mover ,   firm aspiring to lead in  turbulent environment must also be quick to build  customer network centered on its product or service offering 


-  ,  For example ,  when Novell introduced NetWare ,   network operating system for connecting PCs in  local network ,  it first made sure that its product was technically superior 


-  It then discounted the product heavily to build an installed base of users and also set up special incentives to encourage software developers to write for NetWare 


-  The more software that was available for NetWare ,  the more popular it became ,  benefiting both Novell and its software developers 


-  Novell managed the cross-product positive feedbacks actively to lock in its market and ,  subsequently ,  made huge profits from upgrades ,  spin-offs ,  and applications of its own 


-  The per-user costs to  provider do not increase with the number of users; in fact ,  they may drop 


-  Also ,  networks with the largest number of consumers always provide more value to consumers than do smaller networks 


-  Therefore ,  consumers may be willing to pay higher prices to join  large network than they would pay to join  small network 


-  As more and more users flock to it ,  there is  product or service lock in 


-  ,  Some have argued that the network effects may lead to the lock-in of inferior technologies 


- 20 The lock-in of JVCs VHS format for videotapes instead of Sonys Betamax format or the dominance of the Qwerty keyboard over the rival Dvorak keyboard are examples 


-  Liebowitz and Margolis argue that ,  contrary to some suggestions ,  VHS and Qwerty were not inferior to the competing technologies then available 


-  ,  While it is important for  first mover to build  customer network early in the innovation process  ( without waiting for the perfect technical offering )  ,  its technology must be at least on par with that of its competitors 


-  Moreover ,  it must continually upgrade its product or service offering to prevent customers from switching to rival offerings 


-  Microsoft ,  for example ,  has been able to maintain its lead in operating systems by offering easy upgrades from DOS to Windows to Windows 95 to Windows NT 


-   customer network is not an asset that  firm owns but is  fickle system of influence that the firm must nurture continuously through its own offerings and the complementary offerings of its alliance partners 


- 22 Left unmanaged ,  the network can become useless very quickly 


-  On the other hand ,  as the Microsoft example suggests ,   well-managed network can be  powerful launching pad for related products and services 


-  Steve Jobss NeXT workstation ,  for example ,  was technically good but not distinctive enough to overcome the network effects of Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard in this market 


-  ,  We can compare  first-mover initiative to  financial call option 


- 23 Options create flexibility and ,  in  turbulent world ,  the ability to value and use flexibility is critical 


-  Being  first mover creates options for  firm ,  but it has to be backed by investments in  customer network in order for the innovation to pay off 


-  But ,  then ,  incentives systems must begin to reward senior managers for timely exits from markets when the flow is unfavorable to the firm ,  even as they do now for timely entries into markets when the flow is favorable 


- 25 However ,  it is difficult to define an enduring strategic intent in  turbulent environment 


-  For example ,  was NEC wise in staying with its computers and communications  ( C&C )  mission? The uncoupling of AT&Ts communication and computer businesses raises questions about the synergies between the two 


-  Perhaps NEC would have been better off if it had moved from hardware to the more lucrative software and information sectors of Infocom ,  as Sony has done 


-  ,  Collins and Porras distinguish between  firms guiding philosophy and its tangible image 


-  Purpose is the broad arena in which the firm seeks to contribute to society ,  whereas its core beliefs and values define how it will achieve its purpose 


-  Tangible image ,  on the other hand ,  consists of  mission that clearly focuses the organizations efforts and  vivid description by which the mission becomes alive and engaging 


-  The concept of strategic intent is ill defined ,  but based on the examples that Hamel and Prahalad provide ,  strategic intent appears to be what Collins and Porras call  tangible image 


-  ,  In turbulent environments ,   tangible image can be useful if it is seen as temporal 


- 27  successful coping strategy in  turbulent environment requires constant experimentation with several images until the firm finds  successful flow 


-  Holding on to one tangible image ,  no matter how carefully crafted ,  can trap  firm in  market that it cannot dominate 


-  For example ,  Silicon Graphics guiding philosophy is  computer screen that will be  window into  virtual world 


-  ,  By relying on  guiding philosophy rather than  tangible image or strategic intent ,  top management is ,  in fact ,  democratizing the strategy-making process 


-  Many firms in Infocom have flattened their organizations ,  not so much to eliminate middle managers or take advantage of advances in corporate information systems ,  but to create the small ,  highly focused units that must innovate 


-  Burgelman ,  in describing the social learning process associated with the development of  new venture ,  connects the opportunistic actions of front-line managers with the vision of top management 


- 28 The initial uncertainty concerning outcomes and the ambiguity of fit with the corporate vision is progressively reduced through an intense process of communication between frontline managers and senior management 


-  Successful entrepreneurship requires both the willingness to experiment outside  plan and the ability to communicate freely and debate openly the value of the resulting outcomes 


-   firms fuzzy vision and opportunistic actions must be reconciled in an ever-changing array of tangible images 


-  They may not shape every innovation in their firms ,  but they certainly have the savvy to evaluate innovative ideas that their frontline managers propose 


-  Grove helped move Intel out of the storage device business; and Gates was behind Microsofts recognition of the Internets possibilities and its decision to trim the companys ambitions for its own on-line strategy 


- 29 However ,  many firms competing in Infocom have deep pockets and are undifferentiated in their distinctive assets or skills 


-  Competence diversification ,  on the other hand ,  is the importing of skills ,  knowledge ,  and assets from other firms ,  building new tacit skills and know-how within the firm ,  and retiring an old competence 


-  Intel ,  for example ,  had to leave the storage device business before it could establish its world-class superiority in microprocessors 


-  In companies such as Sharp ,  competence strengthening is the responsibility of top-level functional committees 


-  Every business unit manager is responsible for competence leveraging 


-  Top management balances the relative emphasis on the three competence management capabilities by balancing the power of the various organizational units 


-  ,  The emerging Infocom mega-industry provides an interesting laboratory for testing the adequacy of existing frameworks for competitive strategy 


-   suggest that they are not designed to deal with the kind of turbulence that we are witnessing in this industry 


-  While being  first mover and an innovator will help ,  it is insufficient 


-  Investing in and growing  customer base can enhance the chances of success ,  but success in the end is determined by industry forces outside the firms control 


-  Constraining them with top-down strategic intent can be counterproductive ,  but their innovative ideas need to be channeled within  guiding philosophy   broad vision of the opportunities that the firm seeks to participate in 


-  Also ,  the added latitude given to frontline managers must be counterbalanced by  context-aware top management ,  which must know the business and be familiar with its supporting technologies 


-  Top managements skills in managing the tensions among these dynamics are  firms real source of competitive advantage 


-  Instead of worrying about designing the right strategic architecture ,  top management should devote more energy to building  proper organizational architecture
