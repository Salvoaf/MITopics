- We live in  quick-fix world where people look for easy solutions to solve complex problems 


-  This goes for both business and personal problems 


-  We want one trick to get employees to adopt behavior that improves quality and causes customers to gush with appreciation ,  or one trick to help us shed 30 unwanted pounds 


-  Usually ,  there is  conspiracy of causes 


-  In management and in their personal lives ,  influencers succeed where others fail because they overdetermine success 


-  Instead of looking for the minimum it will take to accomplish  change ,  they combine  critical mass of different kinds of influence strategies 


-  And while the results are impressive ,  they do not rely on an obscure calculus  if anything ,  they are built on simple arithmetic 


-  Effective influencers drive change by relying on several different sources of influence strategies at the same time 


-  Those who succeed predictably and repeatedly dont differ from others by degrees 


-  By combining multiple sources of influence ,  they are up to 10 times more successful at producing substantial and sustainable change 


-  ,  This claim is based on three studies 


-  We got similar results when we surveyed executives and senior managers 


-   handful  fewer than 5%  had used four or more sources of influence in combination 


-  ,  Study participants who used four or more sources of influence in combination were 10 times more likely to succeed than those who relied on  single source of influence 


-  ,  We continued our exploration into how executives exert influence in  subsequent survey about corporate change initiatives such as restructurings ,  quality or productivity programs and new-product launches  all of which demand new behaviors from employees to be successful 


-  ,  In our third study ,  we shifted the focus from organizational to personal challenges: how people change personal habits such as overeating ,  smoking ,  overspending or drinking too much alcohol 


-  ,  Our model organizes influence strategies into six sources 


-  ,  The first two domains ,  personal motivation and ability ,  relate to sources of influence within individuals  ( motives and abilities )  that determine their behavioral choices 


-  The next two ,  social motivation and ability ,  relate to how other people affect an individuals choices 


-  And the final two ,  structural motivation and ability ,  encompass the role of nonhuman factors ,  such as compensation systems ,  the role of physical proximity on behavior and technology 


-  Effective leaders need to learn how the different sources operate and how to identify implementation obstacles 


-  ,  Source 1: Link to Mission and Values Leaders frequently have  hard time getting people to adopt  new behavior 


-  When  leader asks employees to undertake dramatic quality improvement efforts ,  there is an enormous amount of discomfort ,  conflict and uncertainty 


-  Reasonable people resist things that are uncomfortable or stressful ,  which is why most of these efforts fail 


-  ,  Ineffective influencers assume there is no way to change someones attitude toward  behavior so they compensate for peoples lack of personal motivation by putting pressure on them  ( social motivation )  or bribe/threaten them  ( structural motivation )  


-  Skilled influencers help people transform their attitudes toward  behavior 


-  They are effective at helping people become personally motivated to enact new behaviors 


-  The key is to help people see the broad implications of their actions and choices 


-  How does VanVranken persuade people to make the right decision every time? He makes it personal and connects what they do to individual patients 


-  At the start of  recent meeting ,   man in his early 60s began to talk about his accident several months earlier when his motorcycle was hit by  car that ran  red light 


-  He introduced the physicians and nurses who attended him and also singled out countless others  the employees who provided warm blankets before his surgeries and the people who ordered Popsicles he could eat when he wasnt allowed solid foods 


-  ,  When leaders want to influence people to make significant changes ,  they need to help them connect the changes to their deeply held values 


-  This establishes  moral framework that shifts peoples experience of the new behaviors 


-  If leaders fail to engage peoples values ,  they must compensate for  lack of personal motivation with less profound and sustainable sources of motivation ,  such as carrots and sticks 


-  ,  Although personal motivation can be powerful ,  its rarely enough 


-  Successful influencers find ways to engage personal motivation ,  but then combine it with several additional sources of influence 


-  ,  Source 2: Overinvest in Skill Building Far too many leaders equate influence with motivation 


-  We have an iconic image of the leader at the podium revving up his or her troops ,  and then sending them off to conquer 


-  To these types of leaders ,  the name of the game is motivation 


-  ,  In fact ,  our study showed that  robust training initiative is at the heart of almost all successful influence strategies 


-  Mike Miller ,  vice president of business customer billing at AT&T Inc 


-  ,  succeeded in turning around   , 000-person IT function by creating  culture where everyone spoke up early and honestly about the risks they saw affecting project goals 


-  Early in the change initiative ,  Miller saw that people needed more than the motivation to speak up 


-  He realized people also needed the ability to step up to crucial conversations 


-  In the heat of the moment ,  speaking up about emotionally risky issues requires as much skill as motivation 


-  So Miller made sure people got the right kind of training 


-  ,  Research shows that training is far less effective when its given in one large dose  people retain less than 10% of what they learn in concentrated classes 


-  Learning that is scheduled over time is markedly more successful 


-  His goal was not to finish the training ,  but to keep people focused on it long enough to absorb it  and to adopt new behaviors 


-  He also trained realistically ,  focusing on real business problems 


-  For example ,  participants role-played on such issues as how to challenge unrealistic deadlines ,  how to report project risks and how to hold peers accountable when tasks fall behind schedule 


-  Within six months ,  internal surveys showed that behavior was changing markedly ,  and within nine months virtually every software release in Millers group was coming in on time ,  on budget and with no serious errors 


-  ,  Source 3: Harness Peer Pressure It is tempting to conclude that  strong dose of personal motivation and  substantial investment in personal ability is enough to tip us into new behavior 


-  ,  Whether people acknowledge it or not ,  they often do things to earn praise from friends and coworkers 


-  When  senior engineer tells  junior engineer that production work is for dropouts ,  something very important happens 


-  The junior engineer begins to form impressions about the choices that bring honor and prestige ,  and conversely about choices that lead to  less respected career path 


-  When  new hire challenges an idea in  meeting only to be ostracized by her colleagues ,  another message is delivered 


-  They realize that unless and until they get the social actions positively aligned ,  their chance of influencing change is slim 


-  ,  When Ralph Heath was assigned the job of getting the F-22 Raptor off the drawing boards and into production in 18 months ,  he knew it was  formidable challenge 


-  It was compounded by the fact that he needed the active support of  , 000 Lockheed Martin Corp 


-  employees ,  many of whom saw the move to production as  threat to the stability of the jobs they knew and loved 


-  Leaders in the organization placed  high value on engineering ,  ideas ,  tinkering and design 


-  So he decided to invest in the most influential people  both the formal leaders and the opinion leaders 


-  He brought in customers from the various military agencies and encouraged them to explain their frustrations and concerns with the program 


-  He spoke candidly about the problems he saw and demonstrated  willingness to be challenged when his own actions conflicted with the behavior he asked of people 


-  As Heath won the trust of supervisors ,  they began to influence others 


-  Heath also worked closely with opinion leaders ,  making time available to visit informally with them every week 


-  The group met production deadlines ,  and the resulting product was  success 


-  The F-22s reliability is better than that of the F-15 ,  which has been in use for decades; its operating costs are lower; its repair times are shorter; and its mission capabilities are far superior 


-  ,  Source 4: Create Social Support Its tempting to think that social influence is mostly about motivation 


-  However ,  if you focus only on the motivating power of the people around you ,  you limit your own influence 


-  The reality is that people around you dont just motivate; they can undermine behavior as well 


-  ,  At AT&T ,  for example ,  Mike Miller was the information technology executive charged with improving his groups track record in meeting quality ,  schedule and cost targets 


-  Even when leaders spoke about this behavior ,  they didnt always enable it 


-  They had to get out of their offices and be available when people needed their help 


-  He gave his direct reports lesson materials and tasked them with teaching the skill to people who reported to them 


-  Over the next six weeks ,  the process cascaded down through the ranks until the lesson was implanted throughout the organization 


-  Leaders identified more closely with the concepts and began to feel more responsible for embracing them and encouraging others to do likewise 


-  In addition to getting real-time coaching ,  employees got real-time encouragement 


-   respected person  ( often their boss )  was urging them to try something new exactly when they needed the encouragement 


-  The combination of social motivation and social ability became  powerful force for change in Millers organization 


-  ,  Source 5: Align Rewards and Ensure Accountability If you want to understand peoples priorities and why they put their effort into some areas as opposed to others ,  it usually helps to follow the money 


-  If  leader talks about quality but rewards productivity ,  employees will notice 


-  Chronic problems such as lack of accountability ,  poor productivity and slipshod quality can often be traced to poorly designed incentives that reward the wrong behaviors 


-  In fact ,  creating incentives is often the only real way senior leaders can separate serious priorities from pipe dreams 


-  The CEO might stick his neck out and say ,  Starting now ,  at least 25% of our incentive pay should be contingent on achieving these new measures 


-  At Spectrum Health Systems ,  AT&T and Lockheed Martin ,  management made  point of tracking both results and behaviors 


-  Progress was reviewed three to four times  year ,  sometimes more frequently 


-  Moreover ,  leaders elected to put their own skin in the game: The top two levels of management had at least 25% of their pay at risk 


-  ,  But its not just the top people who need to have  stake in changing entrenched behaviors 


-  People wont support change if the behavior management wants to encourage doesnt make their lives better  ( in the form of opportunities ,  money ,  promotions and so on )  


-  Otherwise ,  you might actually undermine peoples intrinsic motivation 


-  Begin with personal and social sources of motivation ,  and then reinforce them with well-designed incentive systems 


-  ,  Source 6: Change the Environment Three times more people die from lung cancer than from road accidents 


-  Twice as many people die from tuberculosis as from fires 


-  The reason: The daily information people see  the data stream  is at odds with reality 


-  ,  If you want to change an organizations mental agenda ,  you need to change the data that routinely crosses peoples desks 


-  Unlike training or coaching ,  this involves giving people  different diet of information to help them track problems and solutions 


-  ,  which owns an Oklahoma City-based electric utility ,  was concerned about the utilitys reputation for being insufficiently customer driven 


-  When streetlights were out ,  people always blamed the company and said it was unresponsive to the problem 


-  In an effort to turn things around ,  Ryan established  companywide target of having streetlights repaired within five days and created  new weekly reporting mechanism to help managers monitor the problem 


-  Within  short time ,  all but two areas had fixed the problem 


-  Whats more ,  these improvements led to further quality improvements 


-  Citizens and police officers began to see that when they reported dark streetlights ,  the problems got fixed 


-  So they improved their reporting ,  and the entire system became more responsive 


-  Consider the case of an international logistics company that serves the electronics industry 


-  Although the company was meeting all of its internal customer metrics ,  an alarming number of customers  ( more than 12% per year )  were defecting to competitors 


-  The vice president of quality was puzzled ,  so he decided to explore how the customer metrics were calculated 


-  Heres what he found:  salesperson would ask  customer ,  How quickly do you need your deliveries? The customer would reply ,  Within two days 


-  The salesperson would analyze the request ,  and often he or she would say ,  Sorry ,  we cant do it in two days  how about four? Frequently ,  the customer would say that was OK 


-  ,  When it came to tracking the data ,  this company measured how well it kept its word to the customer  in this case ,  whether it delivered packages within four days  and the record was nearly perfect 


-  So why was it losing customers? Well ,  despite what customers agreed to ,  some of them really wanted two-day delivery 


-  Rather than measuring the actual delivery time against the promised delivery time ,  the VP began keeping track of  new number: the delivery time against the customers preferred delivery times 


-  Using this metric ,  performance fell to below 50% ,  which helped to explain the increasing number of customer defections 


-  While this performance metric was discouraging to many of the companys employees ,  it had  positive effect 


-  ,  Sometimes changing the data stream to influence behavior isnt enough 


-  Spectrum Health recently went so far as to create  separate new physical space where people can work on new ideas without the normal distractions and receive the back-end support they need 


-  In the first year ,  says Kris White ,  vice president of patient affairs ,  company employees identified 35 ideas to pursue commercially and received provisional patents on three of them 


-  Leaders of organizations frequently make similar miscalculations in trying to influence change 


-  Too often they bet on  single source of influence rather than tapping  diverse arsenal of strategies 


-  We have learned that the main variable in success or failure is not which sources of influence leaders choose 


-  By far the more important factor is how many
