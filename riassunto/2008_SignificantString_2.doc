- Trying  with difficulty  to shake up  staid industry? It could be that you arent thinking small enough 


-  Joe Fox ,  who has founded two industry-changing companies with his older brother ,  Avi ,  is  big believer in mini-innovations ,  small insights that add up to  big disruption 


-  ,  FOX:  really believe you cant force innovation; its not something that happens in  vacuum 


-  We kept thinking about that five hours and we thought ,  There has got to be  better way and within the next year or two we saw what was going on with the Internet 


-  If  am going to innovate ,   like to start with the desired result ,  that base idea 


-  You have to think about what it is you want to do 


- 95  trade  as we wanted to do  you dont want there to be any potential extra cash needed 


-  You want to make sure youve got that covered 


-  ,  FOX: You know what  lot of people do? They say to themselves ,  if it could have been changed ,  it would have been changed 


-  But you know what? Thats just not how life works 


-  You know theres an opportunity there if people tell you they would use your service 


-  This isnt about nuclear science; its about obvious needs 


-  You know you are on to something successful when somebody says ,  Why didnt  think of that? If you split the atom ,  the next guy isnt going to wonder why he didnt think of that 


-  ,  FOX:  get more fueled and more excited by people saying that they love the concept and that it makes sense to them 


-  As long as you ,  an intelligent person ,  believe that  consumer would use  service like this  which is where  am going to make my money  then Ill find the answers 


-   want to make real-time information available 


-  Can you give us the formulas for real-time balances ,  buying power and margin buying power?  wanted us to calculate intraday ,  after every transaction ,  how much buying power you have left ,  what your balances are ,  how much money youve made and how much youve lost 


-  Wouldnt you want to know your balance in real time and how many more times you can trade? Of course you would 


-  But when we went to the New York Stock Exchange and asked them the formula for buying power ,  they said ,  We dont know 


-  That made no sense to us 


-   started going out to raise money and nobody wanted to give me any 


-  But  knew it was  real business; it just seemed like common sense to me 


-  Who was going to believe us? What have we done? Have we ever run an industry-changing company before? It was tough 


-  ,  FOX: We knew we had to keep thinking about what could make us  little different ,  especially since we didnt have the money to spend on marketing 


-  One day ,   was driving and thinking: What would absolutely get people to want to use our services? Well ,  we could offer free trades 


-  If you are going to trade ,  wouldnt you want streaming quotes like they have in  brokers terminal? We went through four programming groups before we got that done 


-  Two years into it ,  my brother  who is more of  traditional guy  made  comment about how he sometimes wants to touch and feel his money ,  to have somebody explain  new platform or which mutual fund is  better investment 


-  That got us to thinking about what services we could offer in  brick-and-mortar setting 


-  We opened four of them ,  and they became our second-best customer-acquisition tool 


-  ,  FOX: We had  mind-set that made us willing to turn off of the path 


-  People laughed at us ,  and some of our shareholders didnt understand 


-  But my brother was able to think it through logically ,  and from his clear-headed perspective ,  it was the right move 


-  It made sense that people would feel better even if they just drove by our sign ,  or just knew it was there 


-  It made Web Street feel more real 


-  When people feel more comfortable ,  they put more money in  and we make more money on that money 


-  Actually ,  there are some ideas  still believe in that we never got to try at Web Street because the market changed on us 


-  ,  FOX: We did approach E-Trade and we said ,  You need to buy us 


-  We knew they wanted us  our branches ,  our partnerships ,  our technology 


-  They needed the investment community to think of them as the roll-up player 


-  If we had been able to build the company more quickly ,  it would have been  greater opportunity  in the billions 


-  There was time in between when  sat down and tried to think of what  could do ,  and out came nothing 


-   had some time on my hands ,  and  few bucks ,  and you know what happened? Nothing 


-  What  saw in the real estate industry was  basic injustice ,  and  began questioning the establishment 


-  Besides ,  while the media wants everyone to believe that no one is buying  home ,   million homes will be bought and sold in 2008 


-   have the support  need to figure out how we can make ideas work 


-  We couldnt help but think something was wrong with this picture; we were going to do all of the work ,  and the agent was going to make all of this money 


-  ,  FOX: In April 2005 ,   called Joe Barr ,  who had been my president and CFO at Web Street ,  and  said ,  I think weve got something even bigger this time ,  and were doing it 


-  Thats all  needed to hear 


-  Theyve got to believe in it 


-  When people say ,  Joe ,   love the idea and Im willing to work unpaid until weve got what it takes to raise money  thats when  know  have believers on my hands 


-   want them to get to the point where their spouses believe in it ,  and are excited about the opportunity 


-  When somebody says ,  My wife had an idea about this ,   have confirmation that these people really believe in it 


-   want everybody to share their ideas ,  and  make sure they know that 


-  Everyone submitted mission statements based on what they thought we should be all about ,  and they were all somewhat similar: people believed we were changing the industry ,  or helping consumers by putting cash back in their pockets 


-  That opened up everyones thinking ,  and gave us something to talk about 


-  And  want to know what they are hearing from their friends who are still traditional real-estate agents 


-  With Web Street ,   sketched the concept by drawing  computer screen  what youll see on it ,  what advantages it will offer consumers ,  and the different levels of service well provide 


-  You have to know your product ,  what the industry is all about and what you are going to do 


-  In fact ,   went to five different colleges ,  and never graduated 


-  ,  FOX: We were  couple of months into BuySide and into the rebating ,  and  saw that we were going to need to spend  lot of money on marketing ,  just to educate the consumer 


-  If youre selling  home ,  theres an 80% chance youll be buying one ,  too 


-  Wouldnt it be wonderful ,   thought ,  if we could acquire customers by offering them free access to the listings services?  figured that would be too expensive ,  but one day  asked one of my managing brokers and she told me that it is all included in our $100  quarter we pay in dues and we could list as many homes as we wanted 


-  Once you sell  house through me ,  youll probably buy through me ,  too 


-  We just launched  mortgage brokerage in  couple of states; my loan officers are salaried ,  and their bonus depends on how well customers feel they were treated 


-  Thirty years later ,  were trying to come up with  company name and my brother says: Theres something about Iggy
