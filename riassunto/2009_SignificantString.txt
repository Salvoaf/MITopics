- Sustainability is garnering ever-greater public attention and debate 


-  The subject ranks high on the legislative agendas of most governments; media coverage of the topic has proliferated; and sustainability issues are of increasing concern to humankind 


-  ,  However ,  the business implications of sustainability merit greater scrutiny  and scrutiny of  different kind than the green-oriented focus thats most common 


-  Will sustainability change the competitive landscape and reshape the opportunities and threats that companies face? If so ,  how? How worried are executives and other stakeholders about the impact of sustainability efforts on the corporate bottom line? What  if anything  are companies doing now to capitalize on sustainability-driven changes? And what strategies are they pursuing to position themselves competitively for the future? ,  To begin answering those questions ,  we conducted  year-long inquiry that involved in-depth interviews with more than 50 global thought leaders ,  followed by the Business of Sustainability Survey of more than  , 500 worldwide executives and managers about their perspectives on the intersection of sustainability and business strategy ,  including their assessments of how their own companies are acting on sustainability threats or opportunities right now 


-  The survey will be conducted annually ,  in order to track changes in how companies are thinking and acting 


-  ,  This article can contain only the high-level findings and highlights from the interviews and survey 


-  For  complete look at the survey results as well as more extensive reporting and analysis ,  go online to the MIT Sloan Management Reviews Web-based guide to all the articles ,  results and data reports yielded by the project 


-  ,  There ,  as here ,  you will find not only answers but ,  equally interestingly ,  questions that are coming to the fore as sustainability concerns of all kinds reshape management practices and strategy 


-  Why is the business case for sustainability-related investments hard to build ,  even when opportunities seem apparent? What particular capabilities and characteristics must organizations cultivate in order to compete most effectively in the new ,  sustainability-altered landscape? How will the relationships among companies ,  communities ,  individuals and governments be changed by sustainability issues ,  and what opportunities does that present? ,  First ,  though ,  the immediate questions: What are executives thinking and doing about sustainability-driven concerns right now? Whats impeding their attempts to both capitalize on opportunities and defend against threats? ,  Heres what our thought-leader interviews and corporate executive survey revealed 


-  ,  When managers and executives refer to sustainability ,  what do they mean  and how important do they think it is? The survey revealed that there is no single established definition for sustainability 


-  Companies define it in myriad ways  some focusing solely on environmental impact ,  others incorporating the numerous economic ,  societal and personal implications 


-  Yet while companies may differ in how they define sustainability ,  our research indicates that they are virtually united in the view that sustainability ,  however defined ,  is and will be  major force to be reckoned with  and one that will have  determining impact on the way their businesses think ,  act ,  manage and compete 


-  Over 92% of respondents told us that their company was already addressing sustainability in some way 


-  ,  Nor does sustainability appear to be an ephemeral strategy concern ,  if we can judge by how little the view of it has been affected by the pressure of the economic downturn 


-  )  ,  Indeed ,   number of thought leaders shared their belief that the downturn has accelerated  shift toward  greater corporate focus on sustainability  particularly toward sustainability-related actions that have an immediate impact on the bottom line 


-  At the same time ,  several survey respondents lamented having to meet higher than normal criteria for sustainability investments 


-  ,  Opinions diverge on some aspects of sustainability 


-  Although the points above reflect  strong convergence of views on the overarching question of sustainabilitys impact on business ,  significant divergence in opinion arose regarding particular aspects of sustainability 


-  ,  Self-identified sustainability experts viewed the topic differently than those who considered themselves novices in the area 


-  We asked survey respondents to rate their experience with sustainability by classifying themselves as either  sustainability expert ,  an individual with some experience or  novice 


-  In  number of cases ,  the perspectives held by these three groups were at odds 


-  ,  It is noteworthy that experts views on the points above were largely consistent with those of the thought leaders we interviewed ,  with experience being the common denominator between the groups 


-  Simply put ,  the more people know about sustainability ,  the more thoughtfully they evaluate it and the more opportunity they see in it  and the more they think it matters to how companies position themselves and operate 


-  ,  As an overall group ,  survey respondents held different opinions from those of the thought leaders we interviewed 


-  On average ,  the thought leaders had more experience with sustainability than the survey respondents ,  so it was not surprising that their views diverged on several aspects of sustainability  particularly on the topics drivers and benefits 


-  The major points of contention included the following: ,  By  wide margin ,  survey respondents identified the impact on  companys image and brand as the principal benefit of addressing sustainability 


-  ( See What Are the Benefits of Action? )  But thought leaders rarely cited this factor  ( or when they did ,  they described it as  second-order benefit )  ,  emphasizing instead  broad continuum of rewards that were grounded more in value creation  particularly sustainabilitys potential to deliver new sources of competitive advantage 


-  Several thought leaders offered other provocative ideas about the potential benefits of addressing sustainability 


-  For example ,  some thought leaders suggested that leadership in sustainability might be viewed as  proxy for management quality 


-  The group of so-called first-class companies in sustainability ,  as identified by survey respondents ,  is populated by the usual suspects often highlighted in business articles ,  reports ,  books and sustainability indexes 


-  In aggregate ,  these companies are demonstrating that  sustainability strategy can yield real results 


-  Our survey and interviews demonstrated that there is  large degree of consensus regarding the potential business impact of sustainability 


-  And our research further confirmed that there are stirrings of activity throughout the business realm 


-  On the one hand ,  more than 60% of respondents said that their company was building awareness of its sustainability agenda 


-  On the other hand ,  most companies appeared to lack an overall plan for attacking sustainability and delivering results 


-  Many of their actions seemed defensive and tactical in nature ,  consisting of  variety of disconnected initiatives focused on products ,  facilities ,  employees and the greater community 


-  While these efforts might be impressive on some levels ,  they largely represented only incremental changes to the business 


-  ,  Clearly ,  companies can do more to connect their stated intent in sustainability with business impact  and they can do it in  way that maintains explicit links to the bottom line over both the short term and long term 


-  But why arent they ,  given that they believe sustainability will materially affect their business? ,  Many thought leaders and survey respondents viewed sustainability as  unique business issue ,  both strategically and economically 


-  They embraced the following principles: ,  These principles make sustainability  uniquely challenging issue for business leaders to manage and address effectively 


-  Second ,  companies struggle to define the business case for value creation 


-  Our survey revealed  pervasive lack of understanding among business leaders of what sustainability really means to  company 


-  This shortcoming results from several underlying information gaps 


-  ,  All of these issues point to  critical need for  thorough and structured gathering and sharing of basic facts about sustainability as  first step toward helping managers to be more decisive in the choices they face 


-  ,  Some companies have difficulty modeling the business case  or even finding  compelling case  for sustainability 


-  Most survey respondents who considered themselves experts in sustainability ,  as well as most thought leaders ,  said that their company had found  compelling business case  one that reflected multiple tangible and intangible costs and benefits  for sustainability 


-  ( See How Sustainability Affects Value Creation for  summary of sustainabilitys potential impact when viewed through the lens of shareholder value creation 


-  )  ,  The majority of survey respondents ,  however ,  disagreed: Almost 70% of overall respondents said that their company did not have  strong business case for sustainability 


-  Of these ,  22% claimed that the lack of  business case presented their company with its primary barrier to pursuing sustainability initiatives 


-  ,  Why do companies struggle in their efforts to develop the business case for sustainability? Our survey uncovered three main challenges that trip up companies 


-  The first challenge is forecasting and planning beyond the one-to-five-year time horizon typical of most investment frameworks 


-  But in practice ,  calculating the costs and benefits of sustainability investments over time frames that sometimes span generations can be difficult with traditional economic approaches 


-  Companies find it difficult enough to identify ,  measure and control all of the tangible facets of their business systems 


-  So they often do not even attempt to model intangibles or externalities such as the environmental and societal costs and benefits of their current business activities and potential moves in sustainability 


-  Factors contributing to uncertainty include potential changes in regulation and customer preferences 


-  Strategic planning ,  as traditionally practiced ,  is deductive  companies draw on  series of standard gauges to predict where the market is heading and then design and execute strategies on the basis of those calculations 


-  But sustainability drivers are anything but predictable ,  potentially requiring companies to adopt entirely new concepts and frameworks 


-  ,  Many thought leaders and survey respondents with experience in sustainability believe that clarifying the business case for sustainability may be the single most effective way to accelerate decisive corporate action ,  since it gets to the heart of how companies decide where they will  and will not  allocate their resources and efforts 


-  Indeed ,  survey respondents overall cited outdated mental models and perspectives as the top internal roadblock to addressing sustainability issues 


-  ,  The third major obstacle cited is measuring ,  tracking and reporting sustainability efforts 


-  ,  Some of these barriers ,  it should be noted ,  will accompany any major change effort in corporate strategy and operations 


-  But they are intensified in the case of sustainability ,  given the topics unique economic and strategic challenges and companies limited experience with it 


-  ,  As they confront the barriers to pursuing and achieving sustainability ,  many  if not most  business managers are struggling to understand where their companies are ,  where they need to go and how to get there 


-  They do ,  however ,  share  consensus view that sustainability will have an increasingly large impact on the business landscape going forward 


-  Thought leaders and executives who self-identify as experienced with sustainability issues point out the following emerging realities: ,  The experiences of executives already wrestling with sustainability-driven business issues suggest that companies need not make large ,  immediate investments in new programs 


-  The findings reveal instead that what is essential is that companies start to think more broadly and proactively about sustainabilitys potential impact on their business and industry  and begin to plan and act 


- About halfway through the Wall Street Journals recent ECO:nomics conference   confab of several hundred A-list corporate executives and several dozen green-strategy headliners  there was  Moment 


-  Which means ,  he was implying ,  that if you think his climate goals are too high ,  its only\nbecause your notion of whats possible is underdeveloped 


-  But now it was question time ,  and first there was   ( self-identified )  scientist who questioned all Gores science; Gore effortlessly backhanded him by citing 3 , 000 scientists of his own 


-  It seems to me youre probably the most well-known person arguing that we should be spending  large sum of our money ,  and we should be spending most of our concern ,  on cutting carbon emissions ,  and cutting very very soon 


-  ,  He continued ,  I would argue that the Copenhagen Consensus ,  and  lot of well-esteemed Nobel laureates ,  tell us that scientifically and economically its not  very good way to spend our money 


-  So my point is to say ,  should we have that debate?  know youve sort of dodged that bullet before ,  and  dont mean to corner you 


-  Do you want to have  debate on that? Would you be willing to have  debate with me on that point? ,  Eyes swung from Lomborg to Gore  for whom this could hardly qualify as being cornered 


-  ,  Gore then proceeded to liken questioners of Lomborgs ilk to the tobacco industry rejecting the surgeon generals report and claiming that cigarettes werent all that bad for you ,  after all  and millions and millions of people died as  result 


-  ,  To several of us looking on ,  this analogy seemed  little hard on Lomborg ,  but maybe Gore wouldnt agree  and in any case Lomborg wouldnt be getting any chance for rebuttal 


-  ( Gores answer to Lomborgs request was plenty clear enough 


-  Lomborg: Wanna debate this? Gore: Um ,  no 


-  )  ,  We have long since passed the time when we as  civilization ,  Gore said ,  let alone we as the United States of America ,  should pretend that this is an on-the-one-hand ,  on-the-other-hand kind of situation 


-  ,  ( Now building momentum for his close )  Its really kind of silly ,  for those of us in this generation ,  to look at those coming after us ,  and figure out what were going to say to them if the North Pole ice cap goes away 


-  The Maldives had  new line item in their budget this year 


-  ,  And the punchline: It was listed as fund to buy  new country 


-  ,  At least two things are interesting about the Gore-Lomborg exchange  not to mention the ECO:nomics exploration as  whole ,  which was at every turn both smart and serious ,  if often puzzling 


-  Which was not the only time at the conference when all the ambiguous forecasts ,  authoritative but contradictory policy plans and certain predictions of uncertainty bred bewilderment 


-  No one could agree on anything 


-  It sometimes felt like screenwriter William Goldmans Hollywood ,  where nobody knows anything but everybody would have to go back home and run  business anyway 


-  ,  The second thing is how Gore-Lomborg epitomized another characteristic of not just ECO:nomics but most of the public discussion about sustainability and business: Its nearly always  policy makers debate ,  with managers left to fend for themselves 


-  If youre  business executive ,  its probably not 


-  The lowest return: efforts to immediately cut carbon emissions  ( $0 


-   global warming strategy was ranked second ,  garnering  nearly identical 30% of votes ,  but it wasnt the emissions-reduction approach that Gore and so many others advocate 


-  cap-and-trade ,  or how high to push the price of gasoline or whether to substitute natural gas for oil and build an auto transportation system that could run on it  ( the widely publicized pitch by executive  


-  Almost always the theme was energy  how to change its source  ( can renewables succeed? )  or how to use it more efficiently 


-  ,  And as policy making goes ,  these are seminal questions 


-  ( And the focus on them wasnt entirely unexpected 


-  )  ,  But it was hard to escape the notion ,  during coffee-break chats and in the taxi rank with our rollaways packed to leave ,  that from  managers perspective there might have been  utility problem here 


-  ,  Of course ,  thats  gross oversimplification; no one expects to return from  conference with definitive operating instructions in hand 


-  In many ways ,  wed all better get used to being confused 


-  ,  Neither is the point here to undervalue the kinds of essential policy discussions being held in the press and at official meetings all over  ( and that were conducted especially well at ECO:nomics )  


-  ,  What were interested in at the MIT Sloan Management Review is not sustainability policy alone but its deceptively widespread management implications 


-  Our inquiry: Define and explore how the growing imperative for sustainable business practices will transform managerial decision making and strategy ,  how that imperative will require new organizational structures and ways of working ,  how it will reshape the organizations of the future  and how it will present leaders with new kinds of choices ,  whether they want to confront them or not 


-  To figure out ,  from  managers perspective ,  what to do 


-  ,  The invitation: As this issue goes to press ,  were launching  global survey about sustainability and its strategic management implications ,  and we hope youll join us by taking it and sharing your views  ( if you havent done so already )  


- edu/links/ and youll find  link to the survey along with other links related to this article 


-  Those interviews and now the survey itself aim to explore everything from how executives define sustainability to which sustainability-related issues will be drivers of competitive strategy to what sustainability-related opportunities and threats managers foresee  ( as well as what impediments they encounter when trying to address them )  


-  In other words ,  what will the new ,  sustainability-altered competitive landscape look like? And finally ,  what will businesses have to become in order to succeed in it? What new capabilities and characteristics will leaders have to cultivate in their organizations? In the emerging sustainability economy ,  what will businesses have to be good at in order to thrive? ,  In Thriving in the Sustainability Economy ,  you can see some preliminary answers to that last question ,  along with snippets of comment from the interviewees and follow-on questions that the preliminary answers prompted 


-  ,  The findings from all of the interviews ,  along with the results of the current survey ,  will be explored and interpreted in depth in the months to come  in the Review ,  at sloanreview 


- At the A-list conferences on sustainability and business ,  Amory Lovins is the speaker whom all the other speakers mention from the stage 


-  Hes the touchstone  the talisman that others figuratively hold aloft in order to reaffirm their own sustainability bona fides and intellectual chops 


-  He sits in the front row ,  bespectacled and mild mannered ,  and mostly appears to be curious  about everything  and to have no time for fluff 


-  )  ,  Lovins has worked the intersection of sustainability and business for longer than most of us have known the intersection exists ,  along the way authoring dozens of books ,  including the pathbreaking Natural Capitalism  Creating the Next Industrial Revolution ,  and receiving  MacArthur Foundation genius grant 


-  ,  When audiences of organization leaders ask what you mean by sustainability ,  what do you tell them? ,  The question wouldnt arise because  dont use the word 


-  There are various standard definitions you can quote  ( Brundtland ,  Forum for the Future ,  etc 


-  ,  But behind your question is the core of something very important: the idea that doing business as if nature and people were properly valued actually creates stunning competitive advantage 


-  To put it another way ,  if capitalism is  productive use of and reinvestment in capital ,  we cant deal only with financial and physical capital  money and goods 


-  We also need to productively use and reinvest in the two more valuable kinds of capital  people and nature 


-  If you play with  full deck ,  using all four kinds of capital ,  then you make more money ,  do more good and have more fun 


-  ,  But our survey and others show that businesspeople dont generally believe that 


-  What do you find they do believe ,  when you first talk with them? What misconceptions about sustainability  by whatever name  do you find yourself having to correct? ,  Thats  more useful question 


-  ,  In business ,   love to have competitors who think that way  especially those who think that efficiency costs more or green costs more ,  because thats extremely rare in our experience 


-  And when we do new installations ,  we save more ,  typically 40% to 90% ,  but the capital cost almost always goes down 


-  Its certainly not the case in well-designed new buildings or factories ,  nor in most green vehicles ,  with modest exceptions 


-  In fact ,  in every factory we go into we find the floor lined with $10 , 000 bills 


-  ,  Why dont people pick up that money? What keeps companies from seizing opportunities that you describe as having no downside? ,  Well ,  it requires thought ,  which for some people is exhilarating and for others is painful 


-  It requires change  which requires relentless patience and meticulous attention to detail 


-  In other words ,  its the same as any other management innovation 


-  Its like deciding to have  safety culture or Six Sigma; you really have to pay attention to make it work 


-  It doesnt happen auto-magically because you issue  memo saying its  good idea 


-  ,  Company leaders often characterize the challenge  different way  they talk in terms of the business case for addressing sustainability 


-  In our survey ,  executives say that they cant figure out how to make the business case ,  even when theyre convinced conceptually that there should be competitive benefits 


-  When executives tell you they cant make the business case ,  what do you tell them? ,  If theyve read Natural Capitalism  ( free at www 


- org ,  along with an overview from Harvard Business Review )  and nothing occurs to them ,   sometimes suggest we spend  day together looking at their typical plants and operations ,  and something very interesting will turn up 


-  After all ,  Dow [Chemical] recently invested $1 billion to save $9 billion worth of energy so far ,  and when United Technologies started paying attention ,  they cut their energy intensity 45% in five years 


-  Or consider  very large beverage maker that could ,  we found together ,  make more money from something it was paying to throw away than from its main product  ( but it could continue making that money too )  


-  Typically ,  Principle Two comes next  making things the way nature does ,  with closed loops ,  no waste and no toxicity 


-  These shifts are both encouraged and rewarded by Principle Three ,  the solutions economy business model 


-  Some firms have good opportunities when they follow Principle Four  reinvesting some of the resulting profits into the kinds of capital were shortest of ,  especially nature 


-  ,  Is there particular information that companies need to collect  and understand  in order to construct the business case that will argue for investment? ,  Yes 


-  In many plants that the owners think are running well ,  one can stand in the doorway and see 50% to 75% savings waiting to be exploited 


-  For now ,  dont worry about whether you have enough capital to exploit them; the capital can be found if theres  good business case 


-  ,  What do companies get wrong about this process? Are there common mistakes that ,  if avoided ,  would make the business case much easier to build? ,  The most pervasive mental handicap under which most executives labor is the assumption that  very efficient building or factory must cost more ,  probably  lot more ,  up front 


-  With good design ,  its capital cost will generally go down ,  not up ,  so questions about discount rates and payback periods wont even arise 


-  ,  Many CEOs ,  astonishingly ,  confuse their top and bottom lines 


-  million  year to our bottom line 


-  But in the next breath ,  he added ,  I cant get excited about saving energy ,  though  its only  few percent of my cost of doing business 


-   had to do the arithmetic and show him that if ,  hypothetically ,  he achieved the same result in his 90-odd-million square feet of facilities worldwide ,  his total net that year would rise by 56% 


-  That got his attention! The great engineer was quickly promoted and spread his practices all over the company 


-  ,  Another common error is to tell the shop floor engineers to meet  12- or 18-month simple payback on energy efficiency ,  even though the payback implied by the firms IRR or ROI discounted cash flow hurdle rate is many times longer 


-  In such cases  try to get the comptroller and the engineers to sit together with  graph translating between their respective metrics  then maybe theyll stop misallocating capital 


-  ,  What other counterproductive managerial assumptions do you encounter? ,  Most executives assume that energy and other resources will be used optimally without being well measured and without accountabilities and rewards 


-  )  Hence RMIs effort to overhaul engineering pedagogy and practice  ( www 


-  ,  The list goes on like this ,  but these examples may suggest the richness of the opportunity when one really pays attention 


-  You discuss the business case in terms of resource efficiency or building and process design or financial strategy 


-  You dont make  case for addressing sustainability 


-  ,   think the key is to not try to make  business case for addressing sustainability 


-  Instead ,  create  robust business strategy that takes into account all four kinds of capital but leads you to actions that youd wisely undertake even if you had no environmental concern 


-  Think about it: You dont want to make your business depend on  random variable ,  like oil prices ,  as the automakers have discovered 


-  And you dont want to make your business depend on the availability of something thats insecure ,  like fossil fuels or water ,  or things that can create conflict 


-  You dont want to have those embarrassing conversations with OSHA or the EPA ,  so its better to design out of your process anything that can harm the workers or the neighbors 


-  ,  This goes back to the question about common misconceptions 


-  The social and market forces that are demanding and receiving such amazing innovation in technology design and competitive strategy can all be phrased in different ways depending on what youre personally worried about 


-  Whether youre driven by environmental issues or national security issues or competitiveness and profit issues ,  you can still end up doing precisely the same things 


-  ,  So you think strategy ought to be formed in ways that dont require somebody to be invested in protecting the environment ,  just invested in making smart strategy? ,   wouldnt put it quite that way 


-  Often people do come for help because of environmental concerns ,  but if they do ,  Ill say ,  Well ,  heres how to do what you want ,  and by the way ,  itll be extremely profitable  much better than your present business and more robust and secure 


-  If they are concerned about ,  say ,  national security ,  Ill say ,  Oh ,  by the way ,  this also has these economic and environmental benefits 


-  If they have  truly narrow bottom line approach ,  Ill say ,  Boy ,  are you going to make  lot of money off of this 


-  And by the way ,  it will also have security and environmental benefits 


-  ,  Indeed ,  energy efficiency is an interesting example ,  because besides being very profitable in private internal cost ,  it often has side benefits that are worth one or two orders of magnitude more than the saved energy 


-  An efficient data center will have an order of magnitude better uptime 


-  Oh ,  and since in  typical office you pay 164 times as much for people as for energy ,  if you had   


- 6% or so gain in labor productivity ,  that would have the same bottom line effect as making your energy bill zero 


- 6% but about 6% to 16% ,  there are one to one-and-a-half orders of magnitude greater bottom line benefits from labor productivity than from the energy savings themselves ,  even if the energy savings were 100% 


-  ,  Are there other rewards that you think companies addressing sustainability will experience  regardless of their angle of entry? ,  Anybody who runs such  company is likely to tell you that their biggest win is in recruiting ,  retaining and motivating the best people 


-  Take an example like Wal- ,  Mart ,  which you would perhaps not normally think of in terms of talent competition; its not like  high-tech or financial services company 


-  And yet ,  once the associates realized that what the company was up to and what they were being personally invited to take responsibility for would make their communities better and their families healthier and give more meaning to their lives ,  they grabbed the initiative with such enthusiasm that one of the officers in charge of the greening of Wal-Mart told me about  year ago ,  It feels like Im hanging on to  few hairs coming out the end of the tail of  powerful tiger thats bounding off in all directions; Im hanging on for dear life trying to learn fast enough to steer this critter that we have somehow mobilized beyond our wildest dreams 


-  What have you seen happen to  businesss external relationships? ,  They gain an obvious advantage simply from this: If you want to succeed in any business ,  you have to be the kind of business people want to do business with and feel good about 


-  Conversely ,  if you screw up ,  especially environmentally and increasingly now in social issues ,  you will lose your franchise ,  your social license to operate ,  and then youre dead 


-  Which means we have to keep asking ,  what prevents organizations from adopting them? Youve already mentioned the odd combination of zeal and patience that any sort of major change requires ,  and weve explored the challenges of the business case 


-  What else gets in the way? ,  Arrogance 


-   culture thats hermetic and not properly permeable to outside ideas  especially if the ideas come from people who are different or are ideas that people in the organization disagree with 


-  Its  way of learning 


-  Theres  line  love from Judy Brown ,  in  Leaders Guide to Reflective Practice ,  that proposes we ask ourselves whenever we fail to connect with someone ,  What is it about me that makes me unable to learn from this person? ,  Or as my wife Judys late father ,  an ex-Marine ,  used to say in his later years ,  I dont like that man 


-  ,  Whats an example of how those mind-set barriers keep businesses from seeing their opportunities or threats? ,  Im having this difficulty at the moment working with senior people in the nuclear power industry 


-  Im trying to help them understand who their competitors are ,  who supply more energy than they do and are growing tens of times faster because theyre cheaper and have less financial risk ,  but the nuclear industrys theology says these are not real competitors; theyre not legitimate; they cant amount to much 


-  ,  The power of accepted models? ,  Paradigms hold immense sway over our minds 


-  Youve talked often about system problems  such as in the energy or health care markets ,  among many  in which all the incentives are misaligned in ways that discourage efficiency 


-  Do you believe that individual companies can achieve competitive advantage even when working against an ill-conceived system? ,  Absolutely 


-  My own view of  sound national energy policy is that all ways to save or produce energy should be allowed and required to compete fairly at honest prices ,  regardless of their type ,  technology ,  size ,  location or ownership 


-  ,  But customers are not simply stuck with the resulting offers from various monopolists and monopsonists 


-  If you dont like the kind of officially sanctioned and subsidized energy supply youre offered ,  you can bypass the whole system by buying your own efficiency and ,  increasingly ,  renewables 


-  ,  Are there particular organizational capabilities or attributes that you think companies need to cultivate in order to be able to capitalize on sustainability-related opportunities? ,  Ive already mentioned humility 


-  Anderson says ,  the summit is really high and encased in swirling mists 


-  We know which way is up ,  he says ,  and you get there  step at  time  which  think is  much wiser approach than the usual hoopla 


-  If youre  company that sticks to its knitting ,  minds its own business and doesnt pay attention to whats happening in the world around you ,  youre probably riding for  fall and missing some big business opportunities ,  because in any business  can think of  including all of them in the 30 sectors weve worked in so far  its the hidden connections between your business and other opportunities that you think are well outside your boundaries that create extraordinary opportunity or risk ,  depending on the way you handle them 


-  ,  This is another way of saying that you need  really wide-angle lens 


-  You can still have  sharp focus ,  but you sure need peripheral vision
