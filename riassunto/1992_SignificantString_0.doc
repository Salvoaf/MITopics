- Philosophers and writers have long tried to raise awareness about the difficulty of balancing confidence with realism ,  yet the consequences of unsupportable confidence continue to plague businesses 


-  Managers deal in opinions  they are bombarded with proposals ,  estimates ,  and predictions from people who sincerely believe them 


-  But experience tells managers to suspect the certainty with which these beliefs are stated 


-  For instance: ,  Managers know that some opinions they receive from colleagues and subordinates will be accurate and others inaccurate ,  even when they are all sincerely held and persuasively argued 


-  Moreover ,  given any strongly held opinion ,  one seldom has to look far to find an opposing view that is held no less firmly 


-  When asked for his position ,  he replied ,  I feel strongly about this;  just havent made my mind up which way 


-  As  case in point ,  the manufacturer cited above accepted the staffs confidently bracketed sales projections of twenty-three to thirty-five units per day and designed its highly automated factory to take advantage of that narrow range 


-  ,  How should managers deal with the often unreliable opinions they receive? The answer lies in recognizing that most peoples beliefs are distorted by deep-seated overconfidence 


-  Once we understand its nature and causes ,  we can better devise plans for controlling it 


-  ,  Recall the loan officer who believed that his colleagues were overconfident about their competitors 


-  He went to his boss with this concern and proposed measuring the degree of confidence his colleagues had in their knowledge about the banks competitors 


-  ,  The loan officers test asked for both best estimates and ranges of confidence around those estimates 


-  The bank test included confidence ranges for questions like: What was the total dollar value of new commercial loans made by [Competitor X] last year? and What is the total number of commercial loan officers at the sixth- through tenth-ranking banks in [our city]? ,  We believe that ,  like the loan officers reluctant boss ,  you will be surprised at how poorly you do on the test below 


-  For each of the ten quantities in the quiz ,  simply give  low guess and  high guess such that you are 90 percent sure the true value will lie between them 


-  Try it before reading further ,  particularly if you are apt to be confident of your ability to predict accurately 


-  ,  The confidence quiz measures something called metaknowledge: an appreciation of what we do know and what we do not know 


-  Normally ,  we define knowledge as consisting of all the facts ,  concepts ,  relationships ,  theories ,  and so on that we have accumulated over time 


-  Metaknowledge concerns  higher level of expertise: understanding the nature ,  scope ,  and limits of our basic ,  or primary knowledge 


-  Metaknowledge includes the uncertainty of our estimates and predictions ,  and the ambiguity inherent in our premises and world views 


-  ,  At times ,  metaknowledge is more important than primary knowledge 


-  For example ,  knowing when to see  lawyer or  doctor  ( metaknowledge )  is more important than how much we know about law or medicine  ( primary knowledge )  


-  We draw on our metaknowledge when we conclude that we have enough information and are ready to make  decision now 


-  Only when we appreciate the limits of our primary knowledge can we sensibly ask for more or better information 


-  ,  Examining confidence ranges ,  one of several ways researchers study metaknowledge ,  is  practical means of assessing personal uncertainty 


-  Having sound metaknowledge means being able to predict within reasonable ranges 


-  ,  Whether you should focus on 90 percent ,  70 percent ,  or just 50 percent confidence ranges depends on the issues and risks involved 


-  When building  complex new oil refinery ,  where the downside risks are high ,  you may want to incorporate even extreme swings in oil prices 


-  In that case ,  perhaps  95 percent confidence range on future crude oil price levels should be assessed 


-  ,  We and others have found that whether managers are asked for 50 percent ,  70 percent ,  or 90 percent confidence ranges ,  few employees are able to supply them realistically 


-  Yet to size up and factor uncertainty into our judgments is crucial to successful decision making 


-  In technical language ,  few people are well calibrated; that is ,  few people can accurately assess their uncertainty 


-  No group of managers we tested ever exhibited adequate metaknowledge; every group believed it knew more than it did about its industry or company 


-  Of the  , 000-plus individuals to whom we have given  ten-question quiz using 90 percent confidence intervals ,  fewer than  percent were not overconfident 


-  The only cross-cultural studies ,  done with Asian managers of several nationalities ,  further confirm the ubiquity of overconfidence 


-  ,  If  question falls outside your area of expertise ,  should you be excused if your confidence interval misses it? When we ask ,  How many total employees did IBM have on its payroll on 31 December 1990? managers outside the computer industry sometimes remark that IBMs staff size is irrelevant to their job ,  so they should be forgiven for their poor performance on an overconfidence quiz 


-  If you know  lot ,  as  computer industry manager should ,  your 90 percent confidence intervals will be narrow; if you know less ,  they should be wider 


-  In either case ,  your subjective 90 percent confidence intervals should ,  by definition ,  capture the true answers 90 percent of the time 


-  )  ,  In actuality the job relevance of the questions does affect results ,  possibly because experience reduces over-confidence 


-  The data-processing managers ,  too ,  showed less overconfidence on industry-specific items  ( 42 percent misses )  than on general business facts  ( 62 percent misses )  


-  ,  Although these results suggest that job relevance tends to reduce overconfidence ,  would such  pattern be confirmed by  more systematic study? Moreover ,  is the reduction in overconfidence only partial ,  or would questions very specific to peoples jobs drastically reduce overconfidence? We tested this using ninety-six professionals drawn from  variety of occupations 


-  We used two different confidence quizzes: the first contained fifteen job-specific questions; the second contained fifteen questions unrelated to these professionals jobs 


-  As  check ,  we asked everyone afterwards to rate the job relevance of the fifteen questions in the first quiz ,  using  scale from   ( irrelevant )  to   ( highly relevant )  


-  For these 90 percent confidence ranges ,  the unrelated quiz yielded 53 percent misses  ( instead of the ideal 10 percent )  


-  Note that overconfidence does not vanish ,  but remains at 29 percent over the ideal ,  even for the most relevant questions 


-  ,  In sum ,  better primary knowledge is generally associated with better  ( though still imperfect )  metaknowledge 


-  That is ,  experts know better what they dont know ,  and this fact is one key to effective solutions ,  as we discuss next 


-  ,  How might professionals develop  sharper sense of how much they do and do not know? Once the existence of overconfidence is acknowledged ,  two elements are essential: feedback and accountability 


-  Accountability forces us to confront that feedback ,  recalibrate our perceptions about primary knowledge ,  and temper our opinions accordingly 


-  Overconfidence persists in spite of experience because we often fail to learn from experience 


-  In order to learn ,  we need feedback about the accuracy of our opinions and doubts 


-  We also need the motivation to translate this information into better metaknowledge 


-  ,  At least three groups of professionals have used systematic feedback and accountability to develop excellent metaknowledge: Shells geologists ,  public accountants ,  and weather forecasters 


-  Shell had noticed that newly hired geologists were wrong much more often than their levels of confidence implied 


-  This overconfidence cost Shell considerable time and money 


-  How could well-trained individuals be overconfident so much of the time? Put simply ,  their primary knowledge was much more advanced than their metaknowledge 


-  To develop good metaknowledge requires repeated feedback ,  which was coming too slowly and costing too much money 


-  As part of this training ,  the geologists received numerous past cases that incorporated the many factors affecting oil deposits 


-  ,  When experienced auditors pro vided estimates and confidence ranges for account balances ,  they actually proved slightly underconfident 


-  Perhaps accountants have learned to compensate for overconfidence because of their role as detectors of fraud and error 


-  The profession places an extraordinarily high value on conservative judgments 


-  This superb accuracy holds along the entire range of probability ,  except at the highest levels 


-  ,  What these three groups have in common is precise ,  timely feedback about repeated judgments in  field whose knowledge base is relatively stable ,  unlike the stock market or fashion industry; for instance 


-  Furthermore ,  all three groups are held accountable by their supervisors or professional colleagues for the accuracy of their confidence judgments 


-  Within  day; the weather forecasters receive feedback about whether or not it rains ,  and their predictive performance is factored into their salary increases and promotions 


-  We believe that timely feedback and accountability can gradually reduce the bias toward overconfidence in almost all professions 


-  Performance reviews should emphasize the value to the firm of realism and back this emphasis up with both assessments and incentives 


-  In addition ,  training programs can provide feedback on simulated or past decisions whose outcomes are not widely known ,  just as Shells training program did 


-  ,  Systematic feedback works ,  even though it treats only the symptoms of overconfidence 


-  That is ,  it corrects overconfidence without teaching what caused it in the first place 


-  Several other techniques for reducing overconfidence directly attack its causes 


-  No single cause or prototypical situation can be consistently connected with overconfidence 


-  There are three classes of causes: cognitive ,  physiological and motivational ,   major reason for overconfidence in predictions is that people have difficulty in imagining all the ways that events can unfold 


-  Psychologists call this the availability bias: whats out of sight is often out of mind 


-  Because we fail to envision important pathways in the complex net of future events ,  we become unduly confident about predictions based on the fewer pathways we actually do consider 


-  Bridge players provide  telling example of how availability can cause over-confidence 


-  Less experienced players believe they can make hands they often cannot ,  precisely because they fail to consider uncommon occurrences 


-  ,   second reason for overconfidence relates to the anchoring bias ,   tendency to anchor on one value or idea and not adjust away from it sufficiently 


- 10 It is typical to provide  best guess before we give  ballpark range or confidence interval 


-  For example ,  we usually estimate next quarters unit sales before we come up with  confidence range 


-  One group  ( of eighty-four people )  first gave  best estimate ,  that is ,  an anchor point ,  and then provided  90 percent confidence interval 


-  The second group  ( of fifty-one people )  directly supplied  confidence range without ever committing to  best guess 


-  Thus ,  overconfidence was reduced substantially by simply skipping best guesses and moving directly to ranges 


-  )  ,  Although this de-anchoring technique has yet to be verified outside the controlled laboratory ,  we see no reason why it should not work as well in managerial environments 


-  Interestingly ,  how well it works will depend on managers ability to focus on the confidence interval and block out of their thinking any earlier estimate that might serve as an anchor 


-  ,   third cognitive reason for overconfidence concerns our mental search process 


-  When making predictions or forecasts ,  we often lean toward one perspective ,  and the natural tendency is to seek support for our initial view rather than to look for disconfirming evidence 


-  Realistic confidence requires seeking disconfirming ,  as well as confirming ,  evidence 


- 12 Whenever source credibility is low ,  as is often the case in business ,  and the strength of the evidence is highly suggestive ,  overconfidence is likely to occur 


-  Ironically ,  Griffin and Tversky predict under-confidence under reverse circumstances ,  when the credibility of the source is high ,  but the evidence does not point strongly to one action or opinion 


-  ,  Hindsight makes us believe that the world is more predictable than it really is 


-  What happened often seems more likely afterwards than it did beforehand ,  since we fail to appreciate the full uncertainty that existed at the time 


-  At the time of the nominating conventions ,  the outcome of the election seemed far from certain 


-  Indeed ,  University of Chicago MBA students that summer gave Bush only  49 percent chance of winning , 13 and the political press frequently cited the wimp factor 


-  ,  What remedies are available for cognitive sources of overconfidence? We look at five techniques 


-  ,  Recall how successful Shell was in training its junior geologists on past cases where the outcome was known ,  so they could get immediate feedback 


-  Using tests derived from actual company records ,  employees could be trained to estimate their confidence in knowledge relevant to their new jobs 


-  And ,  in contrast to learning from experience ,  which tends to be slow and expensive ,  good feedback will reduce overconfidence cheaply 


-  ,  But what can you do when faced with  single decision that you must make soon? Try to improve your thinking by bringing to mind relevant considerations that might easily be overlooked 


-  ,  Think of reasons why your initial beliefs might be wrong ,  or ask others to offer counterarguments 


-  This groups mean estimated probability of being correct was 72 percent 


-  The other half of the participants were asked to think of the major reason why the alternative circled might be wrong before giving their subjective probabilities 


-  This groups average estimated probability of being correct was 73 percent ,  and they actually picked the correct answer 62 percent of the time 


-  Thus ,  their level of overconfidence was only 11 percent ,   reduction of nearly two-fifths thanks to  single counterargument 


-  Other studies have found that ,  when listing pros and cons ,  the cons do the most good in countering overconfidence 


- 16 ,  But is this practical? It depends 


-  We see no reason why major capital budgeting requests could not have  counterargument section in which managers are asked to identify the major reasons not to go ahead 


-  ,  managers withholding their genuine concerns in favor of saying whatever gets the budget approved )  


-  ,  If we are overconfident in predicting success because we cannot see the paths to potential trouble ,  fault trees may help 


-  To be useful ,  fault trees must be reasonably complete ,  at least in identifying the major categories of potential trouble 


- 20 In the restaurant study ,  some people were shown branches with only six instead of twelve causes and asked to provide further reasons 


-  In sum ,  the more causes generated ,  the smaller is the error of assuming that all relevant causes are already listed ,  If deeper thinking is called for ,  beyond the listing of reasons ,  explicit scenario analysis may be useful 


-  Envisioning vastly different worlds than those expected has helped companies like Royal Dutch/Shell to better estimate economic and political uncertainty 


- 21  direct test that compared 90 percent confidence intervals before and after scenario construction found ,  on average ,   30 percent stretching of ranges 


- 22 Asking managers to construct different scenarios makes them better appreciate the uncertainty in key parameters or estimates 


-  ,  Although these techniques are valuable ,  we happily acknowledge that ,  for many managers ,  awareness alone may be all that is needed 


-  Good managers often devise their own solutions to the problems of overconfidence 


-  After failing the tailored overconfidence quiz ,  he took immediate action 


-  ,  The head of sales for Index Technology took  different approach when his salespeople were overconfident about if and when orders of the companys product would be written by potential customers 


-  He called some customers himself His salespeople didnt like it ,  but the approach worked: soon they were predicting orders and the timing of those orders much more accurately 


-  ,   negotiation experiment further underscores the value of awareness alone 


- 23 Subjects believed they had  65 percent chance of winning in  simulated negotiation task entailing binding arbitration 


-  The researchers then took  random half of the people aside and warned them about overconfidence 


-  Twelve financial officers were asked to estimate ten quantities pertinent to their organizations business operations and to provide  90 percent confidence interval for each 


- 24 As usual ,  these intervals failed to capture the true value  high percentage of the time; in this case ,  the failure rate was 78 percent versus the ideal of 10 percent 


-  will contain the actual value 


- every officer should have answered nine because that is what  90 percent confidence interval means ,  by definition 


-  The others estimated that fewer than nine of the ten intervals would capture the true value 


-  These data suggest that people are more aware of overconfidence in general than they are in particular 


-  ,  The same problem  of general awareness but specific blindness  was described by John Stuart Mill ,  the 19th century economist and social philosopher ,  in On Liberty: ,  Because overconfidence is  distortion of judgment ,  it is often thought of as  purely mental phenomenon; however ,  at times it has biochemical causes 


-  Euphoria ,  the elated feeling of well-being that commonly follows personal or professional success ,  may cause overconfidence 


-  )  We also suspect that drugs like cocaine and alcohol can produce overconfidence 


-  In response to these conditions ,  Ford organized meetings of its plant managers and assistant managers to solicit and communicate suggestions for improving manufacturing quality 


-  Because of the euphoric mood at the end of the meetings ,  senior executives distrusted their managers judgment ,  and they wanted time for  more calculated look prior to committing major funds 


-  ,  Dealing successfully with physiological causes of overconfidence ,  as with all types of overconfidence ,  requires awareness of the problem: you cant fix it if you cant find it 


-  In this regard ,  individual awareness is the single most important factor 


-  ,  By this time ,  you may wonder if gr9ups do better than individuals when sizing up uncertainty 


-  At other times ,  however ,  groups may bolster the majority opinion to even more extreme levels 


-  ,  To test group overconfidence ,  we conducted  simple experiment with eighty-three managers 


-  First ,  people were asked to privately form 90 percent confidence ranges on ten questions 


-  Some groups argued heatedly; others merely averaged the individual guesses; still others used the most extreme values in the group as their outer brackets 


-  The initial ,  unrevised private judgments generated an average of 72 percent misses  ( compared to an ideal of 10 percent )  ,  signifying serious overconfidence 


-  At worst ,  they forced  compromise; at best ,  they encouraged openmindedness 


-  There are relatively simple techniques for minimizing this recidivist tendency: ,  Delphi techniques and other procedures for sharing and averaging opinions are especially feasible in  networked PC environment 


-  After group discussion ,  ask for one more round of opinions and run with those averages 


- 27 ,  Overconfidence isnt all bad! One legitimate cause of overconfidence is our need to believe in our abilities 


-  Indeed ,  confidence in ones abilities is particularly widespread 


-  ,  Many of these people are distorting reality ,  yet their optimism has motivational value 


-  Would risky projects be undertaken if  few key people did not have an unrealistic belief in their chances of success? As Goethe wrote ,  For  man to achieve all that is demanded of him he must regard himself as greater than he is 


-  ,  If the motivating value of overconfidence is clear ,  so is its downside 


-  The value and danger of overconfidence may especially conflict for entrepreneurs 


-  They often take risks others would not ,  and they must persuade investors and employees to join them in highly uncertain endeavors 


-  Yet their eventual success also requires realism 


-  an unshakable sense that they absolutely cannot fail 


-  ,  Moreover ,  to succeed in many business endeavors ,  we have to project confidence even when it cannot be justified 


-  Because people often equate confidence with competence ,  you had better sound confident if you want your opinions to be treated as credible 


-  ,  Can anything be done to reconcile the danger of distorting reality with the value of optimism? Perhaps the best advice is: Dont fool yourself Dont permit yourself to be overconfident when making important decisions or commitments 


-  ,  We believe that much of the damage can be avoided if managers distinguish between deciding and doing 


-  But in implementing the decision ,  the motivational benefits of overconfidence frequently outweigh its dangers 


-  When you are implementing ,  indulge in overconfidence when ,  and if it is valuable to your performance or that of others 


-  ,  All of us need self-confidence to function 


-  We might not show up for work every morning if we did not believe we could make  difference 


-  Nevertheless ,  too much confidence can backfire  can cause us to bet on plans ,  people ,  or projects which  more realistic appraisal would have rejected 


-  Though normally an advocate of rational calculation ,  Lord Keynes keenly observed this human dilemma: A large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than on mathematical expectation  


-  if animal spirits are dimmed and the spontaneous optimism falters ,  leaving us to depend on nothing but mathematical expectation ,  enterprise will fade and die
