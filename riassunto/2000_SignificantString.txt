- Give me  global-pricing contract ,  and Ill consolidate my worldwide purchases with you 


-  Increasingly ,  global customers are demanding such contracts from suppliers 


-  For example ,  in 1998 ,  General Motors Powertrain Group told suppliers of components used in GMs engines ,  transmissions and subassemblies to charge GM the same for parts from one region as they did for parts from another region 


-  ,  As globalization increases ,  customers will rachet up pressure on suppliers to accept global-pricing contracts  ( GPCs )  


-  Purchasers may promise international markets ,  guaranteed production volumes and improved economies of scale and scope 


-  But what if they fail to deliver or if suppliers global-price transparency inspires them to make unrealistic demands?2 ,  Suppliers must make three key decisions: whether to pursue  GPC ,  how to negotiate the best terms and how to keep  global relationship on track 


-  We have found that the best tool for suppliers is solid information on customers 


-  Information can help the supplier make  sensible counterproposal to demands for the highest levels of service at the lowest price 


-  In 1996 ,  Proscenium XL agreed to  global contract to manage worldwide advertising for   


-  Fortune 100 company 


-  Having no significant business with the client in nonU 


-  markets ,  Proscenium XL saw an opportunity to expand its relationship 


-  However ,  the contract stipulated that Proscenium XL would charge lower fees in anticipation of higher volumes and would not represent any of the clients nonU 


-  ,  Upon inking the contract ,  Proscenium XL discovered new information 


-  The clients managers in nonU 


-  markets had considerable autonomy 


-  They demanded localized programs and services  and resented having to displace their old agencies 


-  When many of the clients managers abroad stopped using Proscenium XL ,  the agencys  


- based global-account-management team was powerless ,  fearing to jeopardize  


-  business with the client 


-  Soon the client dropped all nonU 


-  business with Proscenium XL ,  which then was in  worse position in markets where it had sacrificed existing relationships with the clients competitors 


-  ,  Managers can learn much from other companies GPC experiences 


-  We saw  need to extend current globalization research and study how suppliers approach global-pricing contracts 


-  )  ,  For suppliers to understand when they could benefit from  GPC ,  they should first consider why customers want them and then what they  the suppliers might gain 


-  ,  Customers recognition of procurement as  value-adding activity has sparked their interest in GPCs 


-  Global customers now have the information technology and standardization of product lines to track suppliers product and service prices worldwide ,  consolidate demand and purchase centrally 


-  Multinational corporations country subsidiaries continue to reduce autonomous contracting for supplies 


-  So far customers enjoy most of the benefits ,  but some GPCs help suppliers ,  too 


-  )  ,  For the customer ,   GPC improves operations efficiencies  for example ,  in product development ,  inbound logistics and marketing 


-   GPC helped one manufacturer  ( building the same motor to different design specifications ,  with different parts from suppliers in different locations )  get  central design team ,   standardized design and  single global supplier 


-  ,  Suppliers do not need to lose out when customers globalize 


-  The most attractive global-pricing opportunities are those that involve suppliers and customers working together to identify and eliminate inefficiencies that harm both 


-  ,  Sometimes suppliers do not have  choice 


-  They dont want to shut themselves out of business with their largest and fastest-growing customers 


-  Supplier Procter  Gamble finds that 39 customers with international sales distribution account for 47% of total sales to P&Gs top 100 customers  and are growing 3% faster than the other 61 


-  ,  For smaller suppliers and those lacking global reach ,  GPCs can provide international legitimacy and access to global markets 


-  Multiyear GPCs can give suppliers  predictable flow of business ,  eliminate competition and tighten customer relationships 


-  Suppliers with guaranteed volumes do not have to worry as much about beating the bushes for customers 


-  ,  Also ,  global customers can become showcase accounts ,  bathing suppliers in  halo effect 


-  One chemicals manufacturer concentrated on relationships with  few select customers 


-  It had decided that its strength lay in value-added services but that potential customers in emerging markets were fixated on price 


-  The select customers ,  however ,  were interested in money-saving supply and inventory-management initiatives developed jointly with the supplier 


-  ,  Once the systems were established and providing benefits ,  competitors of the chemicals suppliers showcase customers had to develop equivalent systems 


-  Their first choice for  supplier was obvious 


-  ,  If suppliers think  GPC will have  negative impact ,  they should negotiate better terms 


-  The supplier should never customize to the point that it cannot transfer the learning and economies of scale 


-  )  ,  The successful chemicals supplier customized only logistics and inventory-management systems ,  whereas Proscenium XL ,  the advertising agency ,  was forced to customize the basic product and incurred added costs 


-  The chemicals suppliers cost savings let it reduce the prices it charged the customer ,  creating  win-win situation 


-  Proscenium XL found  whole new meaning for win-win: The customer won twice at the suppliers expense 


-  ,   suppliers size and account concentration can determine if  GPC is worthwhile 


-  Committing to  global supply contract may increase risks for suppliers that are smaller than their global customers 


-  One medium-sized Brazilian chemicals manufacturer committed 80% of production to  pharmaceutical company and nearly collapsed when the customer integrated production into its own operations 


-  ,  Without  clear plan for how to serve global customers ,  suppliers can end up forging market-entry strategies on  case-by-case basis ,  as  


-  That companys entry into new countries is dictated primarily by the support requirements of its global customers 


-  ,  Global customers demands for detailed cost information also can put suppliers at risk 


-  Toyota ,  Honda ,  Xerox and others make suppliers open their books for inspection 


-  Their stated objectives: to help suppliers identify ways to improve processes and quality while reducing costs  and to build trust 


-  But in an economic downturn ,  the global customer might seek price concessions and supplementary services 


-  Throughout the 1990s ,  Japanese automotive companies pushed suppliers to accept lower margins 


-  Since Asias economic downturn ,  large Asia-based electronics and personal-computer customers have postponed or delayed purchasing from smaller  


-  suppliers and have demanded price reductions 


-  ,  And  global customers sudden growth can hurt the supplier who fails to think long term 


-  Bausch  Lomb was supplier to Sunglass Hut ,  but the  


- based B&L account manager who negotiated the contract failed to anticipate the customers subsequent overseas expansion; he arranged  quantity discount schedule that was not anchored to the  


-  market 


-  When Sunglass Hut expanded globally ,  the order quantities it placed with B&L soared; B&L had to supply large volumes of lenses globally at lower prices and margins than would have been the case with country- or region-specific pricing contracts 


-  ,  The supplier has many questions to research 


-  Will its products and services represent such  high percentage of the customers cost in  country that constant cost-reduction requests are likely? Will the suppliers standardization spur customers to compare the suppliers prices across markets ,  divert products across countries  ( creating gray markets )  and resolve anomalies that might have given the supplier higher profitability? ,  Suppliers must gather information on competitors in local markets  ( specific geographic markets )  


-  Full-line suppliers may be able to offer lower prices through distribution economies of scale but then find that specialty players offer both cost savings and superior cross-border logistics management 


-  Detailed information means informed decisions and better terms 


-  ,  To design an effective global-pricing strategy ,  suppliers also must determine whether numerous single-country customers might be easier to deal with and more profitable than  large global customer 


-  Suppose  supplier has been using local distributors to access and support local customers 


-  Suppliers must determine whether the global contract brings enough extra volume in  particular market  and an insignificant enough price spread  to warrant acceptance 


-  ,  Will the global customer deliver on its promises? If the customers local operating units have profit-and-loss responsibility and see no price advantage in using  global supplier ,  they wont 


-  Only if local compliance is essential to  customers global strategy  ( for example ,  to ensure product integrity )  or has  significant economic benefit can  supplier expect to be able to enforce  global contract 


-  ,  To extract prices that are commensurate with service levels ,  suppliers need  thorough knowledge of how customers vary in their product and service requirements across various country markets 


-  They also need good information on their own companys experience in different markets  the competitive intensity ,  distribution costs and price levels 


-  )  ,   product sold in different markets might vary as to formula ,  packaging or size ,  depending on local tradition ,  regulations or customer preferences 


-   supplier who forwards freight cannot offer the same price everywhere 


-  The procedures involved in clearing products through customs and the costs of setting up warehouses vary 


-   supplier needs detailed ,  activity-based cost information before discussing global pricing 


-  ,  All variations that affect the cost of serving  global customer  ( expedited delivery ,  backup inventory ,  technical assistance ,  after-sale service )  should be reflected in  suppliers price 


-  One freight forwarder had useful information   customers headquarters wanted faster cycle times ,  but its country managers cared most about lower handling costs; the firm was able to define the scope of services for each country and spread the price across markets 


-  ,  Suppliers should research all variances: how global customers local managers differ as to typical size ,  frequency and predictability of orders; or whether  country offers only one distributor ,  which can charge whatever it wants 


-  ,  Information is also needed on sourcing  ( whether the government mandates local sourcing of raw materials ,  transportation ,  processing and labor )  ,  different production costs in plants of varying sizes ,  and exchange-rate fluctuations 


-  Because contractual terms can be difficult to change ,  anticipating ways to handle variances is important 


-  ,   suppliers ability to extract different prices is also affected by competitive intensity in local markets 


-  If one of  suppliers subsidiaries controls  particular countrys supply ,  it can charge  higher price there 


-  But if  supplier has broken into  new market using  low-price strategy to compete with an incumbent ,  it will have difficulty securing higher prices from  global customer in that market 


-  ,  To prepare for  GPC ,   supplier also must have detailed information about its own costs and prices worldwide 


-  Suppliers must try to resolve matters such as the same customer paying different prices for the same product in different countries 


-  Otherwise ,  suppliers could be blindsided by  customer or competitor with greater knowledge of their prices than they themselves possess 


-  ,  That is happening to suppliers of telecommunications infrastructure 


-  Their fastest-growing customers regional and global telecom operators  are uncovering price discrepancies 


-  Customers that find significant variations righteously demand that suppliers lower prices  ( but without compromising service )  


-  ,  However ,  customers truly committed to the global marketplace realize that suppliers have legitimate cost variances that necessarily result in pricing differences 


-  They hesitate to push too hard for the lowest price for fear of reduced service quality or suppliers unwillingness to help out in times of need 


-  The more powerful  supplier ,  the less likely it is to offer the lowest price  especially if it expects  chain reaction among its other customers 


-  ,  Ironically ,  the customer pressing for uniform prices is often itself pricing differently in different markets 


-  It should be made to acknowledge this fact  ( another information-gathering task for the supplier )  


-  Suppliers need all the leverage they can get  especially if the customer commands  large percentage of the suppliers profits 


-  ,  When invited to bid on  global contract ,   supplier may: decline to bid ,  submit  bid but hope to lose ,  bid for the business using the customers current terms ,  or bid only after modifying the terms 


-  ,  Declining to bid is feasible only if the global customer is peripheral to the suppliers current sales  ( and the loss of business can be made up )  or if the customer is not critical to the suppliers future strategy 


-  The option is viable for suppliers with diverse ,  fragmented customer bases that show no signs of consolidation and for suppliers that favor other global customers for strategic reasons 


-  ,  Bidding to lose is an option for  supplier that already has good customers at the global customers country level 


-  If the supplier is sure it can sustain the higher prices it gets from those customers ,  it might bid to lose is by demanding exclusivity 


-  Most customers wont accept that ,  fearing the supplier will leverage its monopoly later to raise prices 


-  ,   small or midsize supplier with international ambitions might accept  global customers terms 


-  If the supplier is recently internationalized and lacks the solid local support organizations it needs ,  it might welcome the short-term convenience of  global contract 


-  Or the supplier might accept the terms because it is highly dependent on the customer and cannot afford to lose the business 


-  ,  In negotiating or bidding on the contract ,  the supplier might want to modify terms that define ,  for example ,  who makes decisions ,  what products and services are covered ,  the geographic scope ,  and the mechanisms for recognizing and rewarding price concessions 


-  It might insist that the customers decision-making unit include line managers not just in procurement  especially those who like the suppliers products and services and are not principally focused on price 


-  ,  One of the most important areas for negotiation is service 


-  The supplier should try to move the procurement discussion from product volumes and prices to cost-to serve  ( what it costs the supplier to serve the customer at the levels of quality ,  availability ,  warranty coverage and speed-of-repair service the customer wants )  


-  If the suppliers market share ,  positioning and pricing are more similar within  region than globally ,   regional contract might be less disruptive 


-  Or  supplier might offer  progressive year-end rebate based on the customers purchases  ( or on its increase over the previous year )  


-   rebate concept can test the customers commitment and its ability to deliver 


-  Even in industries that have well-documented adversarial buyer-seller relationships ,  suppliers can find the right GPC customer 


-  In 1990 ,  ABB found one in Ford ,  which cooperated on  deferred-fixed-price contract 


-  ,  Thus ,  to ensure that  GPC will work for them ,  suppliers should gather information about the customer ,  the markets and the suppliers own practices worldwide 


-  Additionally ,  our research suggests that six factors are critical 


-  )  ,  First ,   customers senior managers must communicate total commitment   prerequisite for overriding pockets of resistance from country subsidiaries 


-  ,  Second ,   customers corporate purchasing staff must not be the sole GPC implementers 


-  The suppliers local offices and the customers local managers must establish  good working relationship prior to the global contract ,  or it will buckle under resistance from purchasers who favor past suppliers 


-  ,  Third ,   systematic implementation process is needed for dealing with the idiosyncrasies of individual markets 


-  Both suppliers and customers must contribute respected ,  empowered people to the implementation team  people able to analyze and assimilate cost-to-serve and price variances across markets and to get acceptance from stakeholders 


-  ,  Fourth ,  the ease with which the two sides can work through the process is  function of the degree of homogeneity across the customers local markets 


-  ,  Fifth ,  suppliers  especially suppliers of products that are core to  global customers business should guide the customer away from  focus on price alone and toward an emphasis on value enhancement combined with price 


-  ,  Sixth ,  suppliers can promote value enhancement through more efficient logistics and inventory management ,  although most customers would consider only the top 5% to 10% of their suppliers as suitable for such coordination 


-  Only those top suppliers sell the customer enough to enable lower costs through logistics and inventory enhancements 


-  ,  Once the supplier has weighed the six success factors ,  it should adopt six behaviors that ,  according to our observations ,  ensure optimum preparation for global pricing: ,  Many global customers try to have it both ways 


-  They want low global pricing from suppliers but prefer their own customers to accept prices based on costs and service 


-  But when procurement consolidation occurs at one level of the value chain ,  the principle of countervailing power inevitably stimulates interest in global or regional contracts at the next level 


-  Interestingly ,  in contrast to todays focus on worldwide contracts ,  Ignacio Lopez ,  the former General Motors manager  known for ,  among other things ,  successful procurement  did not pursue GPCs 


-  His attitude toward cross-border price differences was that GM suppliers should justify their pricing logic to their customers 


-  Although he never obtained the same price for  Pirelli tire supplied in different parts of Europe ,  for example ,  he made procurement savings  source of value to his company in an era of corporate restructuring 


- s global-marketing vice president ,  sums up the plight of vendors that manage global customers in  reactive mode: Customers love  vendors global-account-management system because as soon as  global-account manager is designated ,  they see one person whom they can beat to death to get  lower price 


-  Preparing for global pricing does not mean preparing to charge the same price everywhere  or to be beaten to death 


-  It means establishing information-gathering and coordination processes that ensure the logic and sustainability of prices worldwide 


-   supplier-friendly GPC doesnt have to inconvenience customers 


-  Collaboration with suppliers has been shown to help some buyers save hundreds of millions of dollars 


-  In most of those cases ,  customers first had  multifunctional team select suppliers; then they collaborated with suppliers to reach target prices 


-  We believe that ,  with proper planning ,   proactive approach and successful negotiating ,   global-pricing contract can be  winning outcome for the supplier and serve as the foundation for  broader ,  mutually advantageous customer relationship 


-  With  billion new minds becoming innovation sources for our marketplaces between 1995 and 2010 ,  no one company acting alone can hope to out-innovate every competitor ,  potential competitor ,  supplier or external knowledge source around the world 


-  Strategically outsourcing innovation  using the most current technologies and management techniques  can put  company in  sustainable leadership position 


-  Leading companies have lowered innovation costs and risks 60% to 90% while similarly decreasing cycle times and leveraging the impact of their internal investments by tens to hundreds of times 


-  Strategic management of outsourcing is perhaps the most powerful tool in management ,  and outsourcing of innovation is its frontier 


-  ,  First ,  consider the pharmaceutical industry ,  where independent biotechnology research adds 100 gigabytes per day to the databases of the GenBank alone  ( the National Institutes of Health genetic sequence database ,  an annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences )  


-  No company can hope to keep ahead of such an outpouring by itself 


-  Furthermore ,  at the applied research level ,  combinatory chemistry  ( designing ,  constructing and testing new compounds in vitro at the molecular level )  has reduced experimental cycle times by more than 800 times and lowered costs and risks by more than 600 times 


-  As  result ,  hundreds of small ,  sophisticated firms have entered the field as potential suppliers of innovation radically changing the opportunities for outsourcing and restructuring the entire industry 


-  ,  Next ,  consider both the large services industries ,  where most innovations are dependent on software ,  and the manufacturing world ,  which increasingly relies on embedded electronics 


-  In both cases ,   mere 15 sequences of software can be combined in more than 10 trillion ways ,  each creating  potential new product or process 


-  No internal R&D group can possibly predict ,  evaluate or cover all possible designs or competitive positions 


-  To prosper in this environment  even survive  companies need to systematically tap the capabilities of external knowledge leaders ,  not just for state-of-the-art products and services but also for the continuous innovation and evolution of ideas that will keep companies at the frontier of their industries 


-  Carefully pursued ,  the strategic outsourcing of innovation has led to the restructuring of industries as diverse as automobiles ,  aerospace ,  computers ,  telecommunications ,  pharmaceuticals ,  chemicals ,  health care ,  financial services ,  energy systems and software 


-  ,   high-profile example of outsourcing for innovation is Cisco Systems ,  currently valued at $12 


-  In the early 1990s ,  the company found that it could not rely on internal manufacturing or hiring capabilities to keep up with its 100% growth rate 


-  Instead ,  it established long-term relationships with  few selected manufacturers and opened its systems ,  processes and networks to them for joint equipment development 


-  Today partners provide most of Ciscos component ,  hardware and manufacturing innovation 


-  About 30 vendors and service providers have recently joined the Cisco Hosting Applications Initiative  ( CHAI )  to develop new technology for Ciscos routers and to optimize performance in hosted applications 


-  First ,  demand  ( as defined by real gross national product in the worlds largest and most rapidly growing economies )  is doubling every 14 to 16 years ,  creating  host of new specialist markets sufficiently large to attract innovation 


-  Second ,  the supply of scientists ,  technologists and knowledge workers has skyrocketed ,  as have knowledge bases and access to them 


-  Software-based analytical ,  modeling ,  communications and market-feedback technologies have lowered costs and risks substantially ,  allowing many smaller enterprises to participate in emerging markets 


-  Combined with the Internet and other information technology capabilities ,  interactions among technologies  including the biotech ,  computer ,  chemistry ,  environmental and food fields  are growing exponentially 


-  New management techniques ,  software ,  and communications systems have enabled much better coordination of highly dispersed innovation activities 


-  ,  For large pharmaceutical companies ,  outsourcing to universities ,  institutes and government laboratories has long provided fundamental research knowledge for new product streams 


-  In the 1950s ,  Hoffman La Roche ,  through the La Roche Institute ,  was among the first to formalize such relationships ,  giving researchers support ,  independence and facilities that few universities or independent laboratories could equal 


-  Continuous long-term support to outside researchers is now such an industry standard that some preeminent internal-research companies have been criticized for not outsourcing enough 


-  ,  Outsourcing early-stage applied and precompetitive research is critical in such industries as semiconductors  ( Sematech )  ,  aerospace  ( for systems modeling and new materials )  ,  computers  ( subatomic-particle phenomena and materials interactions )  and foods  ( plant pathogens ,  nutrition and flavor enhancement ,  soils and weather research )  


-  Eaton ,   major equipment manufacturer ,  has long outsourced basic and early applied analysis and design of its gear mechanisms to Illinois Institute of Technology ,  claiming  greater than 90% return over in-house sourcing 


-  and 3D Pharmaceuticals ,  for example ,  have software models to build and analyze virtual chemicals that have demonstrated biological effects 


-  Once  pathogen is identified ,  these companies can test thousands of compounds per day for activity that might destroy the pathogen or interrupt its path 


-  After patenting the most promising compounds ,  they may present packages of attractive new products to their larger partners  to do testing on animals and humans ,  seek regulatory clearance or handle large-scale manufacturing and distribution 


-  ,  No single pharmaceuticals company can hope to match the sum of all the external enterprises innovating in its value chain 


-  As knowledge bases from the Human Genome Project and from worldwide cellular and basic pathogen research explode ,  the interactive outsourced structure has become  model around which much of the industry is restructuring 


-  Innovative companies focus on certain core activities and outsource not only product distribution but also basic research ,  combinatory chemistry ,  clinical trials and field monitoring 


-  ,  The outsourcing of advanced development and product innovation ,  especially for software and component innovation ,  has become de rigueur in industries where the most rapid and high-impact innovation occurs at the supplier level 


-  For example ,  Boeings Defense Operations  ( including recently merged McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell )  just introduced two prototypes of its Joint Strike Fighter  ( JSF )  ,  built using only 58 workers in its Palmdale ,  California ,  factory 


-  With computerized modeling coordinating their activities ,  hundreds of suppliers developed and produced snap-together component modules  allowing Boeing to slash design and revision times and costs 


-  ,  By specializing ,  many suppliers have developed in-depth knowledge ,  skills ,  investment infrastructures and innovative capabilities for their segment of the value chain  advantages that are well beyond those that any integrated enterprise could obtain 


-  billion Dell ,  growing at 47% compounded for the last decade ,  outsources virtually all design and innovation for components ,  software and nonassembly production 


-  It invests heavily only in its core competencies  ( understanding customer needs ,  logistics and component integration )  and wherever it sees  unique opportunity for adding value 


-  By outsourcing ,  it avoids not just huge investments in facilities ,  inventory and human resources but also development risks and investments 


-  Opening up technical needs and production schedules to suppliers ,  Dell obtains the most current products with the shortest innovation and cycle times ,  often with direct shipments from suppliers to customers 


-  Dell has chosen to out-source component production and innovation ,  keeping component integration ,  logistics and customer understanding as in-house core competencies 


-  ,  As  component supplier ,  Intel avoids end-product production and concentrates investments and formidable development capabilities on its specialized competencies 


-  By doing so ,  the company has long been able to offer advanced microprocessors and complex integrated circuits to computer and system customers with  timing ,  quality ,  reliability and cost that has given it  preeminent position in microprocessors 


-  Instead ,  it found that suppliers often had much greater knowledge depth ,  could innovate faster and better ,  and could save Ford the investments and risks of supporting  full range of development activities 


-  Now there is  high correlation throughout the industry between  companys degree of outsourcing ,  its innovativeness and its product margins and ROI 


-  In conjunction with Oracle and Commerce One ,  the Big Three automakers just announced an Internet-based parts exchange  ( estimated at $490 billion )  to support outsourcing 


- 10 ,  Johnson Controls ,  the worlds leading supplier of automotive interiors ,  concentrates only on certain subsystems and sells them to numerous customers 


-  It can therefore support more depth than any integrated auto company in terms of technical knowledge ,  automated facilities and  wide supplier network for interiors innovation 


-  As economies of scale in component knowledge and technologies become more important ,  disaggregation offers many companies greater flexibility ,  lower costs and higher rates of innovation  all at lower risk 


-  Even Europe is beginning to exploit the opportunities ,  with the European Airbus integrators tapping into worldwide component-innovation sources to change the entire performance position of Airbus 


-  ,  Even higher innovation returns can accrue from outsourcing entire business processes or process-design activities that are not core competencies 


-  Functional services ,  such as advertising ,  maintenance and auditing ,  fall into that category 


-  Increasingly ,  major systems  including logistics ,  worldwide accounting ,  energy supplies ,  real-estate operations and software systems development and operations are also outsourced 


-  Sophisticated specialist suppliers can arrive at solutions that fragmented internal sources could never even imagine  and they can implement those solutions rapidly without disruptive internal politics 


- 11 ,  For example ,  Enron Energy Systems has worldwide operations and multisourcing experience that enables it to handle  clients full energy-management system efficiently  ( raw-material sourcing ,  conversion operations ,  equipment purchasing and maintenance ,  facility design and operations and specialized personnel training )  


-  Most clients have dispersed such functions into many different locations and organizations 


-  Enron can often implement solutions for energy supply and usage across internal divisions that might not perceive or have incentives to create such solutions  for example ,  jointly purchasing larger equipment ,  sharing facilities with outsiders or optimizing plant-design ,  maintenance and energy-use trade-offs 


-  One of Enrons innovations involves first offering internal divisions stabilized energy costs through its sophisticated energy-industry knowledge ,  financial modeling and risk-sharing capabilities; and second ,  pricing energy on  per-unit basis  ( per room in hotels ,  per linear foot of production in manufacturing or per square foot in offices )  to fit the specific strategic cost-control needs of each division 


-  Enron can offer solutions using purchased raw materials and equipment at economies of scale its customers cant touch 


-  For specific customers ,  Trigen has increased energy-conversion efficiencies from the national average of 35% to levels as high as 90% 


-  ,  In corporate services  ( financial ,  logistics ,  maintenance ,  software ,  building design ,  auditing ,  real estate ,  human resources and Internet services )  ,  external sources are the dominant innovators 


-  The success of such sources is  function of their depth of expertise ,  their software and investment support and the variety of their customer contacts  ( to enhance innovation opportunities )  


-  In comparison to internal counterparts in integrated companies ,   PricewaterhouseCoopers or Arthur Andersen is more likely to come up with auditing innovations; Hay Management or Hewitt Associates with new performance-evaluation or incentive systems; and Vanguard ,  Merrill Lynch or Alex Brown BT with innovative investment or retirement-plan vehicles 


-  Companies that use only internal sources ,  instead of outsourcing such activities ,  tend to cut themselves off from both  continuing stream of innovations and the opportunity to switch rapidly if  new value-added service appears 


-  Proper outsourcing of entire business processes can speed and amplify major innovative changes 


-  Under stress in  tight labor market ,  RBS wanted to shift its benefits package rapidly toward  new approach that would attract and retain highly qualified people 


-  The bank worked with Hewitt Associates to design and implement the largest cafeteria-style flexible benefits plan in the United Kingdom 


-  Through  value account ,  employees could select ,  for example ,  different in-house benefit options ,  supplemental health coverage or discounted vouchers for groceries ,  child care or life insurance 


-  RBS and Hewitt created innovative tax-free pay and added special plans for maternity leave ,  new hires and termination 


-  To speed implementation and enable continued innovation ,  RBS then outsourced much of the benefit management to Hewitt 


-  Using  robust and secure IT network ,  it electronically connects its Distance Solutions unit to customer sites to develop ,  transfer and coordinate internal and external solutions 


-  Clients thus get faster solutions and avoid overloading local technical-labor markets 


- 13 ,  Outsourcing key phases of new-product introduction speeds the process ,  lowers costs and amplifies impact 


-  For example ,  few companies other than the dotcoms have  deep competence in developing and operating the interactive sites needed for successful product introduction on the Internet 


-  Recently ,  companies such as Verio and Exodus ,  large independent service providers  ( ISPs )  that connect customers to the Internet ,  have been capitalizing on opportunities to support such activities by acting as application-services providers  ( ASPs )  


-  As  part of their services ,  ASPs provide specialized software applications and value-added services to their subscribers and other customers 


-  In addition to providing Web access ,  they facilitate interfaces among innovators ,  Web-design houses ,  large individual customers and specialized market segments 


-  The role of ASPs is evolving ,  not just as  hosting industry but also as an outsourcing industry that connects clients  ( especially small and midsize companies )  to the most advanced software providers on  network basis 


-  ,   high percentage of all innovation occurs at the interface between innovative suppliers and customers  with customers making more than 50% of innovations on new products in many industries 


- 14 ,  Many companies have found that proper attention to outsourcing interfaces upstream and cooperative relationships with distribution partners downstream both lowers innovation costs and enormously expands the value of innovation to customers 


-  Such relationships have benefits for both initial product introduction and subsequent product modification 


-  ,  Nonalcoholic beverage brands ,  such as Snapple and rapidly growing SoBe ,  outsource the mixing and bottling of their new-product introductions; in so doing ,  they avoid huge investments ,  time lags and risks 


-  Pharmaceuticals companies outsource their clinical studies for objectivity ,  higher quality and faster data collection from various sites 


-  Quintiles Transnational Corporation at Research Park ,  North Carolina ,  offers outsourcing services and software to manage pharmaceuticals development ,  clearance and introduction more effectively across diverse locations 


-  And auto companies ,  to make new-product introductions more responsive to customer demands and less subject to hunches ,  are modularizing their designs and accessories ,  reducing their response cycle times to four or five days and creating partnerships both with dealers and with Internet operators such as Autobytel and CarsDirect 


- com in order to collect and analyze consumer preferences rapidly so that they can modify prices and offerings responsively 


- 15 ,  In medical devices ,  codevelopment  outsourcing to obtain specialized customer expertise  is common 


-  In developing real-time microsurgical magnetic-resonance-imaging  ( MRI )  techniques ,  GE Medical Devices personnel worked directly with MITs artificial-intelligence laboratories and surgeon researchers at Bostons Brigham and Womens Hospital 


-  Together ,  they created new devices ,  along with improved scanning and feedback systems ,  to help surgeons position and wield instruments in difficult-to-access locations  with minimum trauma for patients and improved outcomes 


- 16 HP Medical Products has long had relationships with hospitals that allowed live-in Hewlett Packard observers to identify and solve problems that operating-room and medical-care personnel could not see while performing 


- 17 Benefits are shared among the participating parties 


-  ,  Many innovators have found that all they have to do is interest  single buyer at Home Depot ,  Wal-Mart or Circuit City ,  and they have immediate distribution and product support in the worlds most sophisticated marketplaces 


-  Thus ,  downstream distribution outsourcing ,  coupled with the outsourcing of physical logistics to companies such as Federal Express or UPS ,  allows innovators to eliminate multiple phases of product introduction and focus on what they do best: creating 


-  Furthermore ,  the Internet allows companies to deliver upgrades and service support directly to customers  or through intermediaries such as Synergys  without establishing dedicated service centers everywhere 


-  ,  The classic examples are Dell ,  Cisco and the dotcoms ,  which connect  component or subsystem supplier to their product or service platform ,  shipping many elements directly from supplier to customer 


-  Many suppliers have internal knowledge capabilities ,  access to multiple upstream technology specialists and contacts with downstream customer problems and innovations that the coordinating client cannot hope to duplicate 


-  ,  Utilizing outsourcing fully can bring the costs and risks of innovation to new lows 


-  It also mitigates  new reverse-risk  that of  company becoming obsolete if it doesnt participate properly in outsourcing innovation both upstream and downstream 


-  ,  How does  company manage in the new world? The best analogy is surfing 


-  So they position themselves where experience or intuition tells them many waves will be forming 


-  They prepare themselves with the best equipment and training ,  including hundreds of hours of studying waves and other surfers 


-  They learn to discern  likely surfing opportunity from the seas random motion ,  seeking waves that build on the energy of previous waves until they can tell that  really big one is forming 


- 18 ,  In todays world ,  attempting to build permanent marketing or production dominance is futile 


-  But building up skill sets ,  platforms and sensing capabilities can produce successive fast rides 


-  Like Cisco riding the Internet-router wave ,  they must keep in mind that the interacting power and shape of the waves are more important than an individual companys swimming abilities 


-  In todays stormy markets ,  high-level technical ,  market-scanning ,  sensing and responsiveness skills  and  well-designed platform for continual innovation are key 


-  ,  At the core of successfully managing outsourced innovation is an exciting vision that inspires internal and external people to work together with energy 


- 20 ,  Jointly developed visions and figures of merit help create identity and make goals exciting and explicit 


-  Unless the outsource and its people enthusiastically support and benefit directly from innovation ,  it is unlikely to happen 


-  Before finalizing contracts ,  carefully investigating potential partners records on innovation ,  attitudes toward innovation ,  treatment of innovative champions and reward structures for innovation offers high payoffs 


-  ,  Hay Management Group ,   leading human resources outsourcing firm ,  notes that the key to success is both sides getting the relationship right at the outset 


-  There must be mutuality of interest ,  common objectives and an agreed-on scorecard 


-  Hay works with its clients in workshops to understand as clearly as possible each partys needs ,  desires and worst fears 


-  It then jointly establishes  mirror-image scorecard and  two-way accountability system defining exactly which specific Hay and client employees are responsible for each major program goal 


-  Hay notes that the effort vastly decreases risks of outsourcing failure ,  increases client satisfaction and lowers coordination costs 


-  ,  Effectiveness requires both parties to embrace  shared platform ,  first ,  of goals or purposes and ,  second ,  of ethical principles or culture 


-  It also requires that each party has  strong sense that the other is entitled to operate independently despite the interdependence of the relationship 


- 21 Although different from one another ,  Dell ,  Nintendo ,  MCI ,  Eli Lilly ,  Sony ,  Microsoft ,  Home Depot ,  3M ,  Hewlett Packard and Wal-Mart are among the companies that have effectively established such relationships 


-  ,  MCIs innovation-management team seeks and implements associations with small groups and individuals developing services that could attach to the MCI network 


-  Recently ,  MCIs chief technology officer noted that the company had about 20 times as many professional technical people working full time at vendors or partners premises as it did in its own offices 


- 22 However ,  by offering adequate interface information ,   reputation for fairness ,   well-known brand name ,  nationwide distribution and attractive profit prospects ,  MCI stimulated outside software and service innovators to design many new products for the company 


-  )  ,  To attract innovative cooperation ,   company must have some capabilities to access desired markets that supplier-inventors cannot duplicate 


-  That means developing best-in-world performance in  grouping of services ,  skills or systems important to customers 


-  It also means focusing on those genuine core competencies  and  few other essential competencies  that protect the core or are demanded by customers 


- 23 Those central activities define the way the company creates value for customers 


-  They also provide essential bargaining leverage with suppliers and serve as  strategic block against suppliers or competitors wishing to bypass the company and move into its markets 


-  ,  Consider the following example 


-  Exploiting its powerful marketing ,  mass production ,  brand and distribution capabilities ,  Nintendo offers outside game designers  low-investment opportunity to roll out their innovations worldwide 


-  The companys complex presentation technologies and patents  ( as well as its massive marketing capabilities )  prevent independents from attacking its markets directly 


-  Although it creates some games itself ,  Nintendo focuses its resources on those core activities  and lets many outsiders create the games that have made more Japanese game designers into millionaires than any other company 


- 24 ,  Any company can similarly benefit from outsourcing the activities that it cannot become best-in-world at performing  or that are peripheral to its strategic posture  to  best-in-world supplier 


-  ,  Every outsourcing opportunity offers possibilities to improve innovation 


-  Leading professional outsourcers  real estate ,  human relations ,  software systems or financial firms  are just as likely to come up with major innovations as specialized technical-research or product-design houses are 


-  Thats how they maintain their own margins ,  satisfy customers needs and leverage their own intellectual resources 


-  ,  To help find and develop the most talented outsourcing partners ,  some companies  for example ,  Chevron  use process masters 


-  Individual process masters  ( who are usually inquisitive and gregarious people with excellent specialist skills )  and small groups of them become knowledge centers for all divisions in  company 


-  Process masters identify and transfer to other parts of the company best-in-class internal innovations 


-  They also find ,  benchmark and track best-in-world external capabilities for the companys processes 


- 25 Chevrons process masters ,  through constant travel and networking ,  develop knowledge maps to guide other Chevron employees toward both internal and external expertise and help stimulate and facilitate the adoption of new solutions 


-  By improving information about outsourcing possibilities ,  process masters help buttress senior managers with more objective checks against internal pressures to continue outmoded practices 


-  ,  Almost all new services  for example ,  in human resources or financial services ,  in product design or electronic commerce  are developed and tested collaboratively with customers through shared screens 


-  Many others including Boeing ,  Ford and Millennium  do the same thing in the product world 


-  ,  An example is NASAs Web-based ,  collaborative aeronautical-design system ,  called Darwin 


-  Darwin lets its Ames Research Center ,  other NASA facilities and industry partners come together in  virtual work space that is interconnected by NASAs secure nationwide Aeronet 


-  Through broadband video links ,  the parties compare their projections to actual test data while the test is going on 


- 27 ,  Structural Research Dynamics Corporation  ( SRDC )  is one of many specialized software companies helping aerospace ,  auto and mechanical-equipment companies link their CAD-CAM or Catia  ( mechanical design )  software to outside suppliers and customers worldwide 


-  Built on Oracle databases ,  the software allows parties to interact  ( instantaneously or asynchronously )  in either  visual or  formulaic mode to design parts ,  component subsystems or styling features 


-  Both quality and customer-accommodating inputs increase 


-  The approach helps automakers assess thousands of possible engines ,  body configurations and interiors in customer and performance tests that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive 


-  ,  With such software models ,  participants in different time zones or work cycles can perform precisely and asynchronously 


-  Three-shift ,  around-the-clock research and development have become common ,  decreasing cycle times by two-thirds ,  lowering development capital costs and risks by at least that much and allowing the coordinating company to tap into the worlds best minds for better results 


-  Software not new team concepts or personnel-management models  is responsible for most of the increased speed and precision of todays innovation processes 


-  ,  With the far-flung participation that software allows ,  companies need to ensure that they focus on innovation efforts 


-  To do so ,  many adopt figures of merit ,  which define what winning performance really demands and specify technical-economic performance levels that are feasible but sufficiently high to shift customers from one provider to another 


- 29 Company leaders would project known trend performance in the industry and set 30% to 500% higher performance targets  sufficiently high for customers to take risks ,  make changes and invest in new solutions 


-  They can provide the focus ,  cohesion and energizing goals needed for delegating to small ,  flexible ,  decentralized ,  self-coordinating internal or external innovation groups 


-  To lure customers away from Palm Pilot ,  they set  target of superior performance and features  at less than half Palm Pilots price and with appropriately rigorous goals for outsourced features 


- 30 ,  Once companies identify the most talented people and once those individuals have internalized figure-of-merit targets ,  the innovation process can be decentralized and outsourced to any desired level 


-  Too often ,  however ,  buying parties insist on specifying what processes will be used  ( the how )  rather than focusing on the desired result  ( the what )  


-  Because the supplier has greater knowledge in the area under development ,  attempting to manage suppliers rigorously is futile 


-   properly constructed governing software model offers the most objective possible program checks and feedback ,  from competing ideas and customers ,  about gaps the innovating supplier and the potential buyer should address 


-  Software systems based on customer inputs  ( such as Kaos Echo )  or interactive design software  ( Aavids Fluent for flow-process design or CAVE for large-scale equipment demonstrations )  help innovative suppliers understand customer issues in detail ,  lower the risk of creating  new product or process that will fail ,  assist clients in understanding and preparing for innovation ,  transfer knowledge smoothly to them and provide the necessary comfort level to ensure use of the product 


-  ,  Through interactive software ,  customers are sold on the innovation in advance on their own premises 


-  The customer is closely involved in the innovations development and becomes familiar with it 


-  As  result ,  before money actually changes hands ,  the customer is anticipating the innovation and will resist other competing innovations 


-  Because of the uncertainties always present ,   company working with  number of innovating outsource partners should keep them all participating and competing as long as possible 


-  With more innovators involved and critiquing ideas through interactive software ,  the company can decrease its performance and market risks ,  increase the probability of successful innovation and obtain valuable product-performance insights that otherwise might not surface 


-  Sophisticated electronic modeling and visual presentations offer an opportunity for companies to perform joint reviews with their outsourcers and to develop subtleties  ( microscopic views ,  extreme-environment scenarios or simultaneous internal/external views )  that would be too expensive or impossible to create with physical models 


-  ,  Such capabilities allow joint design to move beyond traditional ,  physically interactive ,  culture-sharing teams to collaboration among diverse and independent entities that are physically dispersed and serve no single authority 


-  That new model ,  which might be called independent collaboration ,  is already common at the frontiers of biotechnology ,  software development ,  oceanographic and environmental research ,  nanotechnology ,  microbiology ,  new-materials development and sensor technologies ,  and it is used in the creation of financial tools or entertainment products 


-  ,  Even for systems like the one Boeing used for its joint-strike fighter ,  which simultaneously involved thousands of participants worldwide ,  individuals remained in their own units working for their own goals ,  while benefiting from interactions with other units 


-  ,  Figures of merit ,  properly set ,  are based on the exponential gains in knowledge that are expected to flow from multiple suppliers and their outsource partners working together to improve performance 


-  If  company offers to share with outsource partners any gains from exceeding the targets ,  it may realize entirely unexpected boosts in performance levels 


-  That is what environmental regulators found when they moved from current best-technology standards to market-like incentives that shared gains that went beyond initial targets 


-  Because so much innovation is now in software and potential software is constantly evolving ,  companies that outsource have found that targets based on todays techniques are unproductively binding  and that bonuses for performance gains beyond initial targets offer much higher payoffs 


-  Today hedonic measures  ( anticipating currently unspecifiable but expected total performance gains )  augment directly forseeable cost and gain measures so that managers can make the most of the learning that results from networks 


-  ,  For example ,  Chrysler Corporation has standard contract clauses that specify continuous ,  measurable performance-improvement levels beyond current targets in each year of  contracts life 


-  In industries such as biotechnology ,  performance trends are hard to predict 


-  But even there ,  cost improvements and future yields are often estimated based on an experience curve 


-  Although neither buyer nor supplier knows how they can achieve the result ,  their experience indicates they can achieve it 


-  In some companies  such as Dell and the dotcoms  performance levels are improving and costs are decreasing so fast for their outsourced segments that specifications and prices have to be changed almost daily and shipments made from suppliers directly to customers 


-  These companies have had to create entirely new organizational structures and information systems to deal with the constantly accelerating pace 


-  ,  It is important that both parties agree on specific performance targets that are fair ,  few in number ,  easy to understand and readily usable by the people doing the work 


-  Although clients generally want an out-source provider to innovate and keep its operations at state-of-the-art levels ,  they may insist unrealistically that suppliers pass all gains from innovations to the buyer in their pricing ,  use the buyers own practices to ensure consistency and quality and bill professional inputs on an hourly basis instead of using value pricing or jointly shared innovation incentives 


-  The highly successful CEO of  $4 billion out-sourcing company has suggested  wiser approach ,  saying ,  To encourage innovation ,   wont worry about how much the provider makes from the transaction[but]  will constantly want to know how our relationship with the provider is making us more money than we would otherwise 


-  ,  To help monitor and implement the innovation-creating relationships they seek ,  many of the most successful companies we studied utilized three points of contact to form  system of information exchange and project execution 


-  The first contact point is one in which  few top-level managers review developing opportunities ,  create exciting goals and challenging figures of merit ,  constantly realign existing strategic priorities as external environments change and break bottlenecks that may occur at lower levels 


-  The second contact point is where champions on both sides meet  people whose careers depend on the relationships success 


-  Interactions at that contact point help ensure that the valuable nuances of tacit knowledge about problems and processes get transferred when needed  and that the best vendor talent and sufficient urgency are applied to the project 


-  ,  Communications and innovation are substantially enhanced if client and outsourcer share the same electronic model of products or processes and can work together asynchronously ,  yet within the discipline the software imposes 


-  For example ,  Xerox PARC has found its Colabra software helpful in supporting multiple-knowledge-source interactions that rely on the concept of WYSIWIS  ( What You See Is What  See )  


-  Everyone who works on  product utilizes the same software model and sees what everyone else sees 


-  Supplemented by PARCs Agnoter and Cognoter software ,  the system augments remote or same-room verbal communications ,  allowing different groups to create together and evaluate concepts instantaneously and with precision 


-  By allowing others to observe and critique ideas ,  such software also prevents the contact people from becoming overly impressed by their partners particularly articulate technical people or newest technical solution 


- 33 ,  Many innovative companies operate with highly decentralized organizations that feature only three organizational levels  the people at the top ,  the people doing the project and ,  using open information systems ,  everyone else  and strong incentives adapted to the specific type of innovation sought 


-  At the heart of successful innovation is  common ,  open-information capability that places all participants on the same footing in discussions 


-  But to solve particularly complex problems ,  they work in small project teams with specialists from other disciplines ,  sharing  common information base that is open to everyone 


-  ( Fire walls exist for highly secret or personal information 


-  )  With an open system ,  people cannot argue that their ideas should prevail because they have proprietary information 


-  Many consultants ,  software houses ,  financial services and emerging high-tech companies use such open structures 


-  By contrast ,  multilayered ,  divisional organizations  because they keep people and information in one silo away from the others  are an anathema to innovation 


-  Generally ,  companies that are successful at innovating have porous organizations developed around three such contact centers ,  permitting maximum information exchange and avoiding endless approvals and communications delays 


- 34 But with todays speed and numerous outside suppliers ,  the chaos is not so much managed as it is somewhat orderly 


-  No one manager or team controls the hurricane of worldwide supplier ,  customer and competitor innovations; and yet the hurricane has some broadly predictable characteristics  for example ,  greater bandwidth ,  speeds ,  wireless capabilities and interconnectivity 


-  ,  Using the somewhat-orderly-chaos model ,  companies such as MCI ,  Dell ,  Nintendo and Amgen  as well as television networks and financial-services houses let it be known that they are interested in new product or service concepts with certain defined characteristics ,  that they will use their infrastructures to introduce new products or services for inventors and that they will share rewards fairly 


-  Independent innovators ,  scientists or service providers develop and test their concepts on  small scale until their probabilities of success ,  performance characteristics and potentials are clear enough to permit them to approach the firm as  partner 


-  ,  The independents may receive some early information or support from the potential partner in return for  right of first refusal 


-  As the project passes some way points  points changing constantly with scientific ,  industry and marketplace conditions  the independents may receive further guidance and support 


-  From that group ,   final marketplace test will indicate which concepts should be commercialized ,  and profit- and risk-sharing incentives then take over 


-  The process should be managed as such  with  focus on winning goals ,  incentives and whats ,  not hows  lest genuine innovation be stifled 


-  When the innovation is embodied in products ,  it may simply appear as  purchased component in the final assembly 


-  Although CAE/ CAD/CAM systems have reduced problems of physical fit ,  components often have software features that must be carefully integrated 


-  Hence ,  successful outsourcers insist on constant interactive development ,  disciplined by frequent software tests both before and after physical models are available 


-  Software testing helps create an explanation of why things happen ,  and rapid repeated testing in both physical and software simulations decreases the likelihood of unexpected problems 


-  ,  In cases other than buying or developing innovative components for established product lines ,  many companies migrate toward more circular  ( and therefore simultaneous )  organizational models ,  with units that act independently 


-  They avoid hierarchical models that require ideas to pass in  sequence up and down an organizational ladder or across departmental barriers 


-  ,  Different structures ,  specifically matched to the strategic needs of each outsourcing project ,  can help enormously in stimulating ,  monitoring and transitioning innovation in individual situations 


- 35 But there are some common reasons companies of any size are increasingly benefiting from outsourcing particular aspects of innovation 


-  ,  No single company can innovate better than the combination of all its potential direct ,  functional ,  component and service competitors 


-  Each potential supplier can tap into many more upstream technological sources and downstream customer problems and solutions 


-  They may be short on managers who know how to stimulate innovation and who can tolerate its uncertainties ,  challenges and risks 


-  ,  The company that outsources knows it cannot afford development risks for every desired innovation ,  whereas outsource suppliers can spread risks across multiple present and future customers 


-  ,  The company that outsources upstream and partners downstream significantly lowers its innovation-adoption risk 


-  ,  For  noncore activity ,   company may be unable to attract the most talented people to work in-house 


-  ,  Companies can get to market faster through outsourcing and avoid time delays in hiring ,  infrastructure development and internal resistance to new ideas 


-  Outsourcing offers increased opportunities for much faster and lower-cost innovation to companies that develop their core competencies and outsourcing-management practices properly 


-  In fact ,  the supplier side of the process has become the major source of new high-technology jobs ,  new companies and economic growth worldwide 


- 36 ,  Managers will need new strategies for surfing the opportunity waves around them 


-  They will need to leverage their own resources to improve internal innovation practices and develop sophisticated outsourcing partnerships with those billions of new minds who can provide innovative support 


-  And they will need to overcome the not-invented-here forces inside their own and their customers companies 


-  Developing the necessary management practices is not easy 


- As service and product outsourcing become more commonplace ,  new organizational forms are emerging to facilitate these relationships 


-  Chase Bank has created shared services units that compete with outside vendors to furnish services to the banks own operating units 


-  Delta Airlines has established  business partners unit to oversee its relations with some 250 vendors and  , 600 contracts for ground crew and customer services at 186 airports around the world 


-  Microsoft out-sources almost everything  from the manufacturing of its computer software to the distribution of its software products ,  thereby focusing the organization on its primary area of competitive advantage: the writing of software code 


-  Still other firms are creating strategic service divisions in which activities formerly decentralized into autonomous business units are now being recentralized for outside contracting 


-  As these various approaches suggest ,  the best ways to structure out-sourcing remain the subject of ongoing management debate and media coverage 


-  Rather than issuing orders ,  managers must concentrate on negotiating results ,  replacing  skill for sending work downward with  talent for arranging work outward 


-  Thus ,  the outsourcing of services necessitates lateral leadership 


-  ,  We have reached these conclusions about the leadership capabilities required for outsourcing through intensive interviews conducted from 1997 to 1998 with 54 senior managers of twenty-five large firms in the United States and abroad and from  subsequent 1998 survey of 423 managers in  


-  companies  ( see sidebars about participants )  


-  What emerges from the in-depth interviews and the broader survey is  picture of  more demanding leadership environment ,  even as day-to-day management tasks are streamlined by outsourcing 


-  ,  Our interviews of senior managers at twenty-five companies revealed that four individual capabilities encompass much of what is now required of managers as outsourcing becomes commonplace: ,  Strategic thinking 


-  Within the outsourcing framework ,  managers must understand whether and how to out-source in ways that improve competitive advantage 


-  Outsource process managers must broker deals in two directions simultaneously  securing the right services from external providers and ensuring their use by internal managers 


-  After identifying areas suitable for outsourcing through strategic assessment and upon clinching  deal ,  effectively overseeing the relationship is essential 


-  ,  These four capabilities emerged repeatedly when discussing the essential skills of those responsible for outsourcing decisions ,  contracting ,  and oversight 


-  In fact ,  this repertoire of capabilities is probably also critical for joint venturing and other company initiatives that entail working across boundaries without direct authority 


-  ,  Our subsequent survey of 423 managers at  


-  companies corroborated the importance of these four components of lateral leadership for managing an outsourcing contract and relationship across  broad array of industries and company sizes 


-  We also asked these managers how much of  pay premium they would offer  person having all of the capabilities 


-  ,  Moreover ,  because the four leadership attributes constitute  bundle ,  managers who are willing to pay  premium for one capability tend to do so for each of them 


-  billion  similarly value the four qualities ,  although deal making brings the highest premium and is comparably valued regardless of company size  ( see Figure  )  


-  In most industries ,  lateral leadership capabilities command  pay premium  though slightly less so in consumer products and financial services ,  and considerably less so in the utilities industry 


-  ,  Earlier studies of information systems outsourcing touched on aspects of the four leadership capabilities we have noted 


-   detailed examination of thirteen such cases ,  for example ,  found elements of partnership governing to be essential 


-  Another study of sourcing decisions among forty  


-  We also found that companies require this unique blend not only for leadership in the outsourcing of information systems and component manufacturing in which many companies have pioneered ,  but more recently in an array of areas 


-  But certain types of work experience that foster such qualities may be evident ,  and managers reported  willingness to pay substantially higher salaries to those with such  track record 


-  Most of the surveyed managers were willing to pay  premium of  percent or more for previous experience in  (  )  outsourc-ing management ,  (  )  the activity being outsourced ,  (  )  leading of multi-skilled or cross-functional teams ,  and  (  )  joint-venture management 


-  For such backgrounds ,  one-third to two-fifths of the managers are prepared to offer at least an additional 10 percent salary  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  Seasoned veterans in outsourcing ,  the responding managers confirmed the value of their own prior experience for their current work in outsourcing 


-  More than 80 percent said that their previous out-sourcing management ,  team leadership ,  and joint-venture management were of great value to what they are doing now 


-  ,  The four capabilities associated with lateral leadership are evident in day-to-day decision making as well as in longer-term initiatives 


-  Moments of decision by several managers  ( whose names have been changed )  illustrate the four capabilities in action 


-   first quality of lateral leadership is the ability to determine how the outsourcing will serve the companys strategy and gain competitive advantage 


-  ,  Though outsourcing is on the rise ,  company expenditures on outsourcing contracts still account for only  fraction of annual spending  ( see Figure  )  


-  While not  major preoccupation of most top executives ,  sourcing decisions are  critical component of many managers work days and the sole responsibility for some 


-  For both top executives and front-line managers ,  deciding which activities to be contracted out requires an understanding of the firms strategic imperatives and how to achieve them 


-  Strategic thinking is thus essential for making sourcing decisions at all levels even though such decisions constitute only one part of  far larger mosaic of managerial action 


-  ,  Consider John Thompson ,   manager at  leading  


-  telecommunications company ,  who is responsible for developing the firms outsourcing agenda ,   daunting assignment that involves more than $1 billion in hotly contested sourcing contracts 


-  ,  Thompsons senior managers have told him that cutting service costs and reducing management distraction are essential 


-  Theyve indicated that outsourcing must reduce the complexity of the companys management agenda ,  pointing out that some necessary functions consume more energy and management time than warranted 


-  Precisely where to reduce management distraction depends on the companys core competencies ,  defined in Thompsons words as something that gives us competitive advantage ,  something we are highly competent at as an enterprise 


-  ,  While ridding the company of peripheral in-house functions ,  Thompson studies the inside prospects and outside providers for handling integrated customer billing and concludes that we dont have the wherewithal to do that on our own in my lifetime 


-  Thompson identifies which activities are not core but are cardinal  ( and ,  conversely ,  which are core but not realizable )  ,  and he must have  sound appreciation for the companys strategic direction if he is to make the right choices 


-  Bank manager Susan Meyers says that the crux of the matter is understanding how customers make choices ,  and how we make money 


-  Accordingly ,  the bank is phasing out the high-volume but largely routine authorization of purchases and posting of charges ,  because transaction processing is akin to selling  commodity 


-  Most banks supply these services reasonably well ,  margins are thin ,  and little opportunity remains for outperforming competitors 


-  Customers make predictable choices ,  the bank profits only slightly ,  and outsourcing vendors furnish the services at lower cost and less aggravation to the bank 


-  Value-added services include credit assessment  ( identifying prospective customers as good bets )  ,  reward programs  ( linking card usage to airline mileage )  ,  and seamless service  ( integrating  customers credit card ,  checking ,  and savings accounts )  


-  In an era of mass customization for markets of one ,  the bank is retaining marketing functions in-house to focus on establishing and preserving customer loyalty 


-  And because the risk of outsourcing is perceived to be too high ,  the bank retains the function of reissuing stolen or lost credit cards 


-  As the manager who drafted the banks first sourcing contract pointed out ,  determining what to outsource followed  textbook prescription for attaining competitive advantage 


-  ,  Outsourcing managers create  web of relations between outside vendors and inside operations ,  brokering deals in two directions simultaneously: Securing the right services from external providers and ensuring their effective use by internal managers 


-  The leadership capacity required is comparable to what investment bankers bring to the high-stakes world of mergers and acquisitions: An uncommon ability to create common ground between prospective but wary partners 


-  Picking  vendor is sometimes compared to choosing  marriage partner: The decision can be extremely fateful ,  though the vendor relationship is shorter and the vows narrower 


-  One telecommunications manager had arranged three vendor contracts that she considered make or break decisions 


-  Shared services are most advantageous when they are managed company-wide ,  but this requires reclaiming the discretionary decision-making authority of the operating presidents 


-  Outsourcing thus often leads to partially recentralizing processes that had earlier been decentralized among business units 


-  Yes ,  our individual businesses are accountable for their bottom line ,  and we are eager for each to be productive ,  observed the CEO of the  


-  petroleum company in our study ,  but the well-being of one business unit may impede the well-being of the group or other business units 


-  To transcend such divisions ,  weve got to move forward as  team 


-  Outsourcing managers work doggedly to persuade the business-unit heads to accept services not entirely of their own choosing 


-  ,  Establishing the wrong terms in  sourcing contract can be as calamitous as overpaying for  company acquisition 


-  Fred Steinmetz ,   manager at  commercial bank ,  had negotiated  contract with  provider  decade earlier to support the banks vast credit-card operations 


-  Even with the database swelling to 15 million account holders ,  the contract language withstood the test of time 


-  ,  The steel company in our study opted for giant strides in outsourcing rather than incremental steps 


-  Were in the steel business ,  not the data-processing business ,  explained executive Robert Hunter ,  justifying the decision to outsource management of the firms information systems 


-  We recognized that costs were escalating in that part of our business and that we were incapable of managing them appropriately 


-  ,  Hunter decided to contract out part of the outsourc-ing process itself 


-  He hired several companies that specialize in negotiating contracts ranging from IT management to food-service operations 


-  ,  By contracting with the vendor on such  massive scale and prolonged basis ,  steel company managers supplied this particular vendor with proprietary information that could enable the vendor to service other steelmakers 


-  As positive inducement ,  he inserted incentives for the vendor to help the steelmaker further reduce its internal costs 


-  To monitor and thoroughly understand the firms information systems and to substantiate the vendors implementations ,  Hunter also retained  small ,  but dedicated ,  high-end staff of information technologists 


-  ,  Underestimating long-term problems in an outsourcing deal occurred at one of the commercial banks in our study 


-  For more than  decade ,  it contracted with an information service provider for all back-office processing of its growing credit-card business 


-  The full-service contract had worked well: The bank contained its rising costs and acquired fast-changing technologies 


-  ,  But the bank president believed that the deal may have been working too well for the vendor ,  because of  unique service capacity that the banks contract had allowed it to build 


-  When Visa and Mastercard change their policies ,  for instance ,  the bank informs the vendor ,  and the vendor in turn incorporates the new policies into its service for other banking customers too 


-  Moreover ,  the banks dependency on the vendor for so many services  ( more than  fifth of the banks annual budget is allocated to the relationship )  means that no other vendor knows the banks needs well enough to realistically bid on its work 


-  The downside of being joined at the hip: The bank has lost the upper hand in this vendor relationship and has also foregone any returns from what amounts to  long-term investment in the vendor 


-  ,  To effectively manage their outsourcing relationships ,  partners must not view  deal as one between armslength contractors ,  but rather as between locked-arm partners 


-   third quality of leadership ,  then ,  is adept governing of partnerships 


-  ,   partnership generally connotes the willingness of the two sides to work actively and constructively over time not only to achieve what is required by contract ,  but also to enhance the service quality and financial benefit to each 


-  Not all sourcing contracts lend themselves to partnerships: If the service is clearly delineated ,  relatively unchanging ,  and zero-sum in payoff ,  governance of the contract may require little more than enforcement 


-  But several studies suggest that when one or more of these conditions is absent ,  viewing the relationship as an enduring partnership yields superior results for both sides 


-  ,  The telecommunications firm in our study outsourced part of its retail customer care ,  including telemarketing ,  billing ,  and account management 


-  John Griffith built the enterprise from  desert start to  fully running system 17 days after the company committed to the deal 


-  He became responsible for the service product of  , 400 people  only 150 of whom still wore his companys badge 


-  The company initially forecasted 10 , 000 telephone queries per day from customers ,  but the daily tally soon climbed to 55 , 000 ,   staggering surge requiring three contractors to handle 


-  If you are in an entrepreneurial environment or when market conditions are highly dynamic ,  said Griffith ,  outsourcing is ideal 


-  ,  The telecommunication companys attorneys resisted the formal partnership label to describe the relationship since it connoted liability ,  but Griffith embraced the concept operationally ,  and he picked vendors who sought it as well 


-  ,   partnership implies an enduring engagement that survives and even strengthens with stress and conflict 


-  I want somebody who is with me for the long haul ,  said Griffith ,  who views every contact with providers as either building or eroding their long-term relationship 


-  Like customer-focused companies that treat every employee contact with customers as  moment of truth ,  he saw the most routine encounter with the providers and every decision about them as either helping or hindering his efforts 


-  He could impose stringent demands on the vendor as long as they fell within the terms of their contract; but he also knew that forcing compliance now would probably result in less responsiveness later 


-  During the summer of the contracts first year ,  an unanticipated downturn in customer demand resulted in fewer calls and higher costs 


-  By agreement ,  one vendor reduced staffing by relying on employee attrition; another reduced its service charges but not its staff; and the third ,  whose agent performance was most uneven ,  dismissed its least productive employees 


-  For Griffith ,  governing partnerships required patience and an eye toward the future: I dont want to win the battle and lose the war 


-  ,  In many firms ,  relationship skills are  prerequisite for promotion into positions that are responsible for outsourcing 


-  At  major computer manufacturer ,  for instance ,  the director of strategic staffing ,  Mary Jackson ,  described her ideal candidate to head  global operation with  staff of 700 and an inventory of $700 million 


-  She sought  deal maker and  partnership overseer: Ive got to appoint somebody who can be rigorous and analytical about determining what we do inside and outside the firm ,  someone who can choose the vendors and manage them so that  dont have hiccups 


-  ,  When asked to choose among two candidates ,  only one of whom had already managed an outsourcing contract or  joint venture ,  the candidate with sourcing or joint-venture experience was Jacksons unequivocal choice 


-  Is such experience essential? Absolutely ,  she says ,  its  requirement 


-  Even for the top marketing jobs ,  she wants people who can work to establish partnerships ,  joint ventures ,  and joint marketing arrangements 


-  Since so little outsourcing had been done in the past ,  few inside the company had the skill sets she required 


-  To refocus on the competition ,  top managers wanted to implement global sourcing with  limited number of supplier partners ,  and Jackson knew that this required going outside the company for the talent 


-  For most hourly employees and many managers ,  outsourcing is synonymous with job loss or change 


-  Employees of the express delivery company in our study viewed partnering with  provider as one step removed from consorting with the devil 


-  ,  Thus ,  it is not surprising that the labor union at  steel company with  recent history of outsourcing but  far longer history of collective bargaining has insisted on inserting restrictions on outsourcing into the union-management agreement 


-  The two parties recognize the seriousness of the problems associated with contracting out work both inside and outside the plant ,  the contract states 


-  The agreement prohibits the company from further outsourcing unless managers prove that the existing labor force cannot do the work 


-   manager at an old-line industrial company had sought to migrate all of his companys business units onto  new information platform managed by an outside provider 


-  He encountered deep skepticism among the business-unit heads ,  who wanted to do it their own way 


-  But he discovered that the most vigorous opposition came from the information systems staff itself ,  who feared their own job vulnerability 


-  They dont really want this to happen ,  the manager observed 


-  One key systems engineer ,  for example ,  saw problems developing during the changeover to the provider ,  but he remained utterly unresponsive ,  volunteering nothing about the problems except when asked directly ,  and then offering minimal response 


-  For example ,  managers at one petroleum company dispatched teams to visit forty-five companies that employed outsourcing for some functions they never imagined could be out-sourced 


-  Each six-member team was comprised of people from the companys exploration ,  refining ,  and distribution units 


-  ,  After their return from the company visits ,  the reconnaissance teams reviewed the various functions in their own operations 


-  After the oil company managers had identified opportunities to outsource extensively ,  they still had to overcome employee hostility and reverse their perceptions: We are not saying that people are doing things poorly 


-  However ,  the manager continued ,  outsourcing should be viewed as an opportunity to go out and look at doing things better 


-  ,  The individual component of leadership is what is conventionally considered leadership:  vision of the future ,  excellence in judgment ,  the power of persuasion 


-  The organizational component is what we often fail to appreciate at first but almost always find close behind: cultures ,  incentives ,  and relations that encourage the widespread exercise of individual leadership 


-  Leadership in outsourcing organizations requires both the individual and organizational components 


-  ,  Top management support for outsourcing is widespread ,  and most of the managers we interviewed affirmed that their sourcing efforts are surely doomed without it 


-  More than 80 percent of the surveyed managers report that their top executives back the agenda ,  and ,  by contrast ,  only half viewed their middle-management ranks as supportive ,  and virtually all deemed hourly employees as opposed 


-  ,   nearly universal dictum in outsourcing management is: Measure what you plan to source 


-  Leading  partnership also requires an unambiguous understanding of  shared path ,  so managers must be clear-minded about how they will judge the results 


-  In the words of  manager at one of the commercial banks ,  echoed by virtually every manager we interviewed: If you can measure it ,  you can manage it 


-  If you can manage it ,  it will get better 


-  By pinpointing responsibility and accountability in business units and their subdivisions ,  companies provide managers with the tools required to know if and when they are meeting their performance criteria 


-  ,  At one of the computer manufacturers ,  internal accountability was demanded of four autonomous business units ,  each required by headquarters to meet tough performance objectives 


-  The four units annually purchased several billion dollars worth of outside components and services ,  ranging from disk drives to travel tickets; they later jointly managed purchasing through  practice of shared services 


-  They manage the outside relationships via ten teams whose members are drawn from the line managers of the four business units 


-  Under the leadership of  top executive from one of the four business units ,  each team takes complete responsibility for arranging the sourcing deals and managing the vendor contracts 


-  Several of the teams oversee contracts with providers exceeding $100 million annually ,  and some are managing aggregate annual outsourcing deals worth $300 million or more 


-  To ensure that the business-unit heads drive the shared sourcing ,  the company gives them authority over team appointments and the annual performance review of team members 


-  ,  The company has invested full responsibility and accountability in the teams and their directors for delivering the products and services that the business units demand 


-  With well-developed metrics of performance ,  ranging from cost and quality to timeliness and responsiveness ,  team directors know when they are getting the results they require 


-  So ,  too ,  do the business unit presidents ,  and ,  since they are footing the bill ,  this provides the foundation for their continued support 


-  ,  Corroborating the importance of an organizational architecture that supports rather than undermines effective individual leadership ,  our survey of 423 company managers revealed that companies with higher rates of outsourcing  greater proportions of their annual expenditures allocated to outsourcing contracts  are also more likely to have adopted pay-for-performance plans and created profit-and-loss centers 


-  More generally ,  the data revealed  cluster of company practices that foster  climate conducive to outsourcing and its leadership ,  namely ,  top executive commitment ,  incentive pay systems ,  leadership development programs ,  and profit-and-loss centers 


-  ,  For companies sourcing their services and products ,  the novel blend of requisite skills requires fresh ways of recruiting ,  grooming ,  and promoting 


-  For institutions responsible for educating those who will lead the reconfigured activities  whether outsourcing ,  joint venturing ,  or work teaming  the new demands dictate new forms of management training as well 


-  ,  Our interviews and survey results revealed four critical capabilities on which management recruitment ,  training ,  and promotion should focus 


-  The study indicates that emphasis on these capabilities is widespread ,  and they are equally relevant whatever the company size or product sector 


-  Two-thirds of participating managers reported that they would boost  managers compensation by at least  percent if he or she had the requisite skills ,  and one-third would increase the salary by at least 11 percent 


-  ,  Outsourcing across  broad array of functions is  relatively new arena at many companies ,  and few managers boast rsums with more than  few years of experience in making deals or governing partnerships 


-  Experience in leading cross-functional teams or overseeing joint ventures is useful background 


-  However ,  companies with little work teaming or joint venturing may not find this collateral experience in their ranks 


-  Three-fifths of the surveyed managers reported that their company recruits some managers for outsourcing deals from outside the company 


-  And ,  in their view ,  the company must also invest far more in developing the missing skills during the years ahead  ( see Figure  )  


-  Management development programs can be expensive ,  but if their annual cost runs less than  to 10 percent of  managers yearly compensation ,  the investment is likely to be worthwhile 


-  Teamwork for developing products and focusing on customers also places  premium on working well with those you cannot command 


-  Top-level managers  whether of  division or  company  need much the same skills to manage relations with major customers ,  primary investors ,  and regulatory agencies 


-  Building the four individual capabilities identified in our study and the two organizational capacities  ( see Figure  )  is likely to facilitate not only outsourcing but also joint venturing ,  team building ,  and ,  more generally ,  executive-style leadership throughout  firm 


-  ,  The emergence of shared services units and strategic service divisions in many companies will further foster these leadership capabilities 


-  In gathering  range of sourced services under  single administrative umbrella ,  companies are seeking to exploit the advantages of larger scale and lower price 


-  The director of shared services  increasingly  de facto chief resource officer for the firm  leads an operation that resides partly inside and partly outside the firm ,  with neither part under authoritative control 


-  ,  Although the four desirable managerial elements are bundled ,  specialists do emerge who are strong in one or two areas but not all 


-  The strategic thinkers and deal makers ,  for instance ,  often delegate direct oversight of  contract to other managers ,  and the latter must be effective in governing relationships but not necessarily enabled in the other ways 


-  We noted that managers who place  substantial pay premium on one capability tend to place  high premium on all ,  and specialization in just one or another of lateral skills is unlikely to be sufficient in  world where complete leadership is more widely required and increasingly expected 


-  ,  During the decade since outsourcing has spread from manufacturing components and information systems into  range of other areas ,  many best practices in contracting and managing these relationships have emerged from front-line experience and academic research 


-  Among practices that transcend specific applications are: ,  Managers with the ability to think and lead in  lateral fashion ,  according to the present study ,  are also an essential element if companies plan to successfully implement these and other best practices 


-  ,  Department of Defense ,  for instance ,  writes  million pay checks per pay period at  cost of $12 per check; Automatic Data Processing issues 20 million pay checks per pay period for its contracted customers at  cost of $1 per check 


-   manager acquires the ascribed power of the position to hire ,  fire ,  instruct ,  and budget  ( see Figure  )  


-  Can the manager think strategically? Is he or she able to catalyze  restructuring of the operation to ensure that it facilitates rather than undermines partnerships with outside organizations? We agree with John Gardner ,  Noel Tichy ,  Warren Bennis ,  and other writers on leadership ,  who extol such personal qualities as vision ,  integrity ,  and determination ,  as well as the ability to organizationally delegate responsibility and streamline processes 


-  As outsourcing becomes more prevalent ,  distinctive individual and organizational capabilities conducive to lateral leadership are also likely to become  required part of the managers basic repertoire
