-  No one has to teach an infant to walk ,  or talk ,  or master the spatial relationships needed to stack eight building blocks that dont topple 


-  The young child entering school discovers quickly that the name of the game is getting the right answer and avoiding mistakes   mandate no less compelling to the aspiring manager 


-  People are born with intrinsic motivation ,  self-esteem ,  dignity ,  curiosity to learn ,  joy in learning 


-  ,  Ironically ,  by focusing on performing for someone elses approval ,  corporations create the very conditions that predestine them to mediocre performance 


-  Interestingly ,  the key to their survival was the ability to run experiments in the margin ,  to continually explore new business and organizational opportunities that create potential new sources of growth 


-  ,  If anything ,  the need for understanding how organizations learn and accelerating that learning is greater today than ever before 


-  The old model ,  the top thinks and the local acts ,  must now give way to integrating thinking and acting at all levels 


-  The person who figures out how to harness the collective genius of the people in his or her organization ,  according to former Citibank CEO Walter Wriston ,  is going to blow the competition away 


-  ,  The prevailing view of learning organizations emphasizes increased adaptability 


-  Given the accelerating pace of change ,  or so the standard view goes ,  the most successful corporation of the 1990s ,  according to Fortune magazine ,  will be something called  learning organization ,   consummately adaptive enterprise 


-  The impulse to learn in children goes deeper than desires to respond and adapt more effectively to environmental change 


-  The impulse to learn ,  at its heart ,  is an impulse to be generative ,  to expand our capability 


-  But Japanese firms view of serving the customer has evolved 


-  In the early years of total quality ,  the focus was on fitness to standard ,  making  product reliably so that it would do what its designers intended it to do and what the firm told its customers it would do 


-  Then came  focus on fitness to need ,  understanding better what the customer wanted and then providing products that reliably met those needs 


-  Today ,  leading edge firms seek to understand and meet the latent need of the customerwhat customers might truly value but have never experienced or would never think to ask for 


-  It required  leap of imagination to see what the customer might want 


-  ,  Generative learning ,  unlike adaptive learning ,  requires new ways of looking at the world ,  whether in understanding customers or in understanding how to better manage  business 


-  manufacturers sought competitive advantage in aggressive controls on inventories ,  incentives against overproduction ,  and rigid adherence to production forecasts 


-  Despite these incentives ,  their performance was eventually eclipsed by Japanese firms who saw the challenges of manufacturing differently 


-  They realized that eliminating delays in the production process was the key to reducing instability and improving cost ,  productivity ,  and service 


-  They worked to build networks of relationships with trusted suppliers and to redesign physical production processes so as to reduce delays in materials procurement ,  production set up ,  and in-process inventory   much higher-leverage approach to improving both cost and customer loyalty 


-  ,  As Boston Consulting Groups George Stalk has observed ,  the Japanese saw the significance of delays because they saw the process of order entry ,  production scheduling ,  materials procurement ,  production ,  and distribution as an integrated system 


-  ,  I talk with people all over the country about learning organizations ,  and the response is always very positive ,  says William OBrien ,  CEO of the Hanover Insurance companies 


-  If this type of organization is so widely preferred ,  why dont people create such organizations?  think the answer is leadership 


-  ,  Our traditional view of leaders  as special people who set the direction ,  make the key decisions ,  and energize the troops  is deeply rooted in an individualistic and nonsystemic worldview 


-  In  learning organization ,  leaders roles differ dramatically from that of the charismatic decision maker 


-  These roles require new skills: the ability to build shared vision ,  to bring to the surface and challenge prevailing mental models ,  and to foster more systemic patterns of thinking 


-  ,  Creative tension can be resolved in two basic ways: by raising current reality toward the vision ,  or by lowering the vision toward current reality 


-  ,  once said ,  Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create  tension in the mind ,  so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half truths  


-  Many who are otherwise qualified to lead fail to do so because they try to substitute analysis for vision 


-  They believe that ,  if only people understood current reality ,  they would surely feel the motivation to change 


-  Vision without an understanding of current reality will more likely foster cynicism than creativity 


-  The principle of creative tension teaches that an accurate picture of current reality is just as important as  compelling picture of  desired future 


-  In problem solving ,  the energy for change comes from attempting to get away from an aspect of current reality that is undesirable 


-  Many people and organizations find themselves motivated to change only when their problems are bad enough to cause them to change 


-  With problem solving ,  the motivation for change is extrinsic 


-  With creative tension ,  the motivation is intrinsic 


- 10 In  learning organization ,  the critical roles of leadership  designer ,  teacher ,  and steward  have antecedents in the ways leaders have contributed to building organizations in the past 


-  What is your role? ,   have asked this question of groups of managers many times 


-  The most common answer ,  not surprisingly ,  is the captain 


-  While these are legitimate leadership roles ,  there is another which ,  in many ways ,  eclipses them all in importance 


-  Those who aspire to lead out of  desire to control ,  or gain fame ,  or simply to be at the center of the action ,  will find little to attract them to the quiet design work of leadership 


-  The first task of organization design concerns designing the governing ideas of purpose ,  vision ,  and core values by which people will live 


-  Few acts of leadership have  more enduring impact on an organization than building  foundation of purpose and core values 


-  The corporations immediate response was to pull all Tylenol off the shelves of retail outlets 


-  Authored almost forty years earlier by president Robert Wood Johnson ,  Johnson  Johnsons credo states that permanent success is possible only when modern industry realizes that: ,  Such statements might seem like motherhood and apple pie to those who have not seen the way  clear sense of purpose and values can affect key business decisions 


-  Both the dynamic business environment and the mandate of the learning organization to engage people at all levels now make it clear that this second design task is more subtle 


-  Henry Mintzberg has argued that strategy is less  rational plan arrived at in the abstract and implemented throughout the organization than an emergent phenomenon 


-  Successful organizations craft strategy according to Mintzberg ,  as they continually learn about shifting business conditions and balance what is desired and what is possible 


- 13 The key is not getting the right strategy but fostering strategic thinking 


-  the policymakers need ,  according to Mason and Mitroff 


- 14 More important is the need to achieve insight into the nature of the complexity and to formulate concepts and world views for coping with it 


-  ,  Behind appropriate policies ,  strategies ,  and structures are effective learning processes; their creation is the third key design responsibility in learning organizations 


-  Around 1971 ,  members of Shells Group Planning in London began to foresee dramatic change and unpredictability in world oil markets 


- 15 Progress would probably have ended there ,  had the frustration not given way to  radically new view of corporate planning 


-  Our real target was the microcosm  ( the mental model )  of our decision makers 


-  The initial tool used was scenario analysis ,  through which planners encouraged operating managers to think through how they would manage in the future under different possible scenarios 


-  It mattered not that the managers believed the planners scenarios absolutely ,  only that they became engaged in ferreting out the implications 


-  In this way ,  Shells planners conditioned managers to be mentally prepared for  shift from low prices to high prices and from stability to instability 


-  When OPEC became  reality ,  Shell quickly responded by increasing local operating company control  ( to enhance maneuverability in the new political environment )  ,  building buffer stocks ,  and accelerating development of non-OPEC sources  actions that its competitors took much more slowly or not at all 


-  ,  Somewhat inadvertently ,  Shell planners had discovered the leverage of designing institutional learning processes ,  whereby ,  in the words of former planning director de Geus ,  Management teams change their shared mental models of their company ,  their markets ,  and their competitors 


-  ,  The first responsibility of  leader ,  writes retired Herman Miller CEO Max de Pree ,  is to define reality 


- 17 Much of the leverage leaders can actually exert lies in helping people achieve more accurate ,  more insightful ,  and more empowering views of reality 


-  These mental pictures of how the world works have  significant influence on how we perceive problems and opportunities ,  identify courses of action ,  and make choices 


-  ,  One reason that mental models are so deeply entrenched is that they are largely tacit 


-  Ian Mitroff ,  in his study of General Motors ,  argues that an assumption that prevailed for years was that ,  in the United States ,  Cars are status symbols 


-  Styling is therefore more important than quality19 The Detroit automakers didnt say ,  We have  mental model that all people care about is styling 


-  Leaders as teachers help people restructure their views of reality to see beyond the superficial conditions and events into the underlying causes of problems  and therefore to see new possibilities for shaping the future 


-  ,  The key question becomes where do leaders predominantly focus their own and their organizations attention? ,  Contemporary society focuses predominantly on events 


-  This focus leads naturally to explaining what happens in terms of those events: The Dow Jones average went up sixteen points because high fourth-quarter profits were announced yesterday 


-  Systemic ,  structural explanations go even further by addressing the question ,  What causes the patterns of behavior? ,  In some sense ,  all three levels of explanation are equally true 


-  Unlike the roles of designer and teacher ,  it is almost solely  matter of attitude 


-  ,  While stewardship has long been recognized as an aspect of leadership ,  its source is still not widely understood 


-   believe Robert Greenleaf came closest to explaining real stewardship ,  in his seminal book Servant Leadership 


- 20 There ,  Greenleaf argues that The servant leader is servant first 


-  It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve ,  to serve first 


-  That person is sharply different from one who is leader first ,  perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual power drive or to acquire material possessions 


-  ,  Leaders sense of stewardship operates on two levels: stewardship for the people they lead and stewardship for the larger purpose or mission that underlies the enterprise 


-  If anything ,  people in  learning organization are more vulnerable because of their commitment and sense of shared ownership 


-  Appreciating this naturally instills  sense of responsibility in leaders 


-  The second type of stewardship arises from  leaders sense of personal purpose and commitment to the organizations larger mission 


-  Peoples natural impulse to learn is unleashed when they are engaged in an endeavor they consider worthy of their fullest commitment 


- 21 ,  Leaders engaged in building learning organizations naturally feel part of  larger purpose that goes beyond their organization 


-  They are part of changing the way businesses operate ,  not from  vague philanthropic urge ,  but from  conviction that their efforts will produce more productive organizations ,  capable of achieving higher levels of organizational success and personal satisfaction than more traditional organizations 


-  Their sense of stewardship was succinctly captured by George Bernard Shaw when he said ,  ,  New leadership roles require new leadership skills 


-  This is one reason that understanding the disciplines of  learning organization is so important 


-  ,  Three critical areas of skills  ( disciplines )  are building shared vision ,  surfacing and challenging mental models ,  and engaging in systems thinking 


-  But if you divide  hologram ,  each part ,  no matter how small ,  shows the whole image intact 


-  Each shares responsibility for the whole ,  not just for one piece 


-  Its something like poking holes in  window shade; each hole offers  unique angle for viewing the whole image 


-  ,  When you add up the pieces of  hologram ,  something interesting happens 


-  When more people come to share  vision ,  the vision becomes more real in the sense of  mental reality that people can truly imagine achieving 


-  One reason is that new insights and initiatives often conflict with established mental models 


- 23 ,  Specifically ,  when advocating  view ,  they need to be able to: ,  When inquiring into anothers views ,  they need to: ,  If they reach an impasse  ( others no longer appear open to inquiry )  ,  they need to: ,  The first challenge is to recognize defensive routines ,  then to inquire into their operation 


-  ,   notice that  am feeling uneasy about how this conversation is going 


-  Perhaps  dont understand it or it is threatening to me in ways  dont yet see 


-  But the actual skills whereby leaders are supposed to achieve this are not well understood 


-  In my experience ,  successful leaders often are systems thinkers to  considerable extent 


-  But they do this almost completely intuitively 


-  The consequence is that they are often unable to explain their intuitions to others and feel frustrated that others cannot see the world the way they do 


-  ,  One of the most significant developments in management science today is the gradual coalescence of managerial systems thinking as  field of study and practice 


-  Gore and Associates  ( makers of GoreTex and other synthetic fiber products )  


-  Bill Gore was adept at telling stories that showed how the organizations core values of freedom and individual responsibility required particular operating policies 


-  At one talk ,  he explained the companys policy of controlled growth: Our limitation is not financial resources 


-  Our experience has been that if we try to bring in more than  25 percent per year increase ,  we begin to bog down 


-  He took out  pencil and paper and calculated and said ,  Do you realize that in only fifty-seven and  half years ,  everyone in the world will be working for Gore? ,  Through this story ,  Gore explains the systemic rationale behind  key policy ,  limited growth rate   policy that undoubtedly caused  lot of stress in the organization 


-  ( This is the limits to growth systems archetype explained below 


-  )  The story also reaffirms the organizations commitment to creating  unique environment for its associates and illustrates the types of sacrifices that the firm is prepared to make in order to remain true to its vision 


-  ,  The consequences of leaders who lack systems thinking skills can be devastating 


-  They deal in visions and in crises ,  and little in between 


-  People have no control over their time ,  let alone their destiny 


-  He or she can explain strategies in terms of emerging trends ,  and thereby foster  climate that is less reactive 


-  ,  Many talented leaders have rich ,  highly systemic intuitions but cannot explain those intuitions to others 


-  Ironically ,  they often end up being authoritarian leaders ,  even if they dont want to ,  because only they see the decisions that need to be made 


-  They are unable to conceptualize their strategic insights so that these can become public knowledge ,  open to challenge and further improvement 


-  What follows is  sampling of tools starting to find use in learning organizations 


-  ,  One of the insights of the budding ,  managerial systems-thinking field is that certain types of systemic structures recur again and again 


-  Many other systems get locked in runaway vicious spirals where every actor has to run faster and faster to stay in the same place 


- 27 The template shows the basic structural form of the archetype but lets managers fill in the variables of their own situation 


-  The upper ,  symptomatic solution provides  short-term fix that will make the problem symptom go away for  while 


-  The side effect feedback  ( R )  around the outside of the diagram identifies unintended exacerbating effects of the symptomatic solution ,  which ,  over time ,  make it more and more difficult to invoke the fundamental solution 


-  ,  Several years ago ,   team of managers from  leading consumer goods producer used the shifting the burden archetype in  revealing way 


-  The problem they focused on was financial stress ,  which could be dealt with in two different ways: by running marketing promotions  ( the symptomatic solution )  or by product innovation  ( the fundamental solution )  


-  Yet only through innovation could they retain  leadership position in their industry ,  which had slid over the past ten to twenty years 


-  What the managers saw clearly was that the more skillful they became at promotions ,  the more they shifted the burden away from product innovation 


-  Unless the political values shifted back toward product and process innovation ,  the managers realized ,  the firms decline would accelerate  which is just the shift that has happened over the past several years 


-   classic example was the way  


-  manufacturers faced the low cost-high quality choice 


-  manufacturers have encountered increasing international competition from firms that have chosen to consistently improve quality and cost 


-  ,  When working with managers ,   start this exercise by selecting  specific situation in which  am interacting with other people in  way that is not working ,  that is not producing the learning that is needed 


-  On the left-hand side ,   write what  am thinking but not saying at each stage in the exchange  ( see sidebar )  


-  In the example ,   make two key assumptions about Bill: he lacks confidence and he lacks initiative 


-  Neither may be literally true ,  but both are evident in my internal dialogue ,  and both influence the way  handle the situation 


-  Believing that he lacks confidence ,   skirt the fact that Ive heard the presentation was  bomb 


-  Believing he lacks initiative ,   take this as evidence of his laziness; he is content to do nothing when action is definitely required 


-   conclude that  will have to manufacture some form of pressure to motivate him ,  or else  will simply have to take matters into my own hands 


-  Rather than dealing directly with my assumptions about Bill and the situation ,  we talk around the subject 


-  The reasons for my avoidance are self-evident:  assume that if  raised my doubts ,   would provoke  defensive reaction that would only make matters worse 


-   resort to  manipulative strategy to move things forward 


-  ,  The exercise not only reveals the need for skills in surfacing assumptions ,  but that we are the ones most in need of help 


-  There is no one right way to handle difficult situations like my exchange with Bill ,  but any productive strategy revolves around  high level of self-disclosure and willingness to have my views challenged 


-   need to recognize my own leaps of abstraction regarding Bill ,  share the events and reasoning that are leading to my concern over the project ,  and be open to Bills views on both 


-  ,  The rationale behind learning laboratories can best be explained by analogy 


-  Either alone is incomplete 


-  ,  Second ,  the factors that thwart learning about complex business issues must be eliminated in the learning lab 


-  Chief among these is the inability to experience the long-term ,  systemic consequences of key strategic decisions 


-  One constraint on learning is the inability of managers to reflect insightfully on their assumptions and to inquire effectively into each others assumptions 


-  Research on management simulations has shown that they often have greater entertainment value than educational value 


-  One of the reasons appears to be that many simulations do not offer deep insights into systemic structures causing business problems 


-  Another reason is that they do not foster new learning skills 


-  Undoubtedly ,  the ideas offered above are only  rough approximation of this new territory
