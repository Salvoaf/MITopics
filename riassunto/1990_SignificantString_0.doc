- FOR SOME decades now ,  marketing textbooks and professors have assiduously distinguished between sales and marketing 


-  Theodore Levitts 1960 definition is still the classic: Selling is preoccupied with the sellers need to convert his product into cash; marketing with the idea of satisfying the needs of the customer by means of the product and the whole cluster of things associated with creating ,  delivering ,  and finally consuming it 


-  Nonetheless ,  whatever else marketing encompasses ,  it certainly includes sellingthe getting and keeping of customers and revenues 


-  As the old saying goes ,  In most companies ,  sales is the only revenue-generating function; everything else is  cost center 


-  Sales importance as  source of revenue tends to define the form and substance of companies marketing programsfor both good  (  


-  ,  close attention to buying processes at specific accounts )  and ill  (  


-  ,  confusion between sales and marketing )  


-  ,  Of all sales issues ,  compensation is probably the most discussed 


-  It is now the focus of  vast and varied literature with enough folk wisdom and quantitative studies to satisfy most managerial temperaments 


-  But the great bulk of this literature focuses on what might be called compensation hydraulics: push this pay lever ,  is the typical claim ,  and get this kind of field sales behavior 


-  Lost in this approach is  recognition that sales compensation is an area in which data analysis ,  values ,  and the motivation of complex human beings are inextricably linked 


-  The frequent result is that managers ,  focused on the hydraulics ,  forget that addressing the fundamental question ,  How should we pay the people responsible for dealing with customers? inevitably implicates  range of issues involved in sales management ,  as well as other aspects of the business 


-  The emphasis of the sales compensation plan will affect the quantity and kinds of orders received by manufacturing ,  the cash-flow profile managed by finance ,  the recruitment and training needs faced by marketing and personnel ,  and the daily organizational interactions between sales and all of these other functional areas 


-  ,  To make these decisions ,  managers need  preface to sales compensation which outlines the issues that must be addressed before worrying about the specific numbers or debating between incentive-based and fixed-salary plans 


-  In that spirit ,  this article provides the following:  (  )   discussion of links between compensation ,  evaluation ,  and motivation;  (  )  an analytical process for developing  compensation plan;  (  )  an examination of the important choices made in setting goals and rewarding results in sales; and  (  )   consideration of the relevance and limits of compensation policies within  healthy and effective sales management system 


-  ,  We pay for product ,  not for process ,  is  sentiment one often hears voiced 


-  This view nicely emphasizes the importance of resultsnot just good intentionsin business 


-  But it must not obscure the fact that compensation is primarily  motivational tool and ,  in most companies ,  an evaluation mechanism as well 


-  One can still design  sales compensation plan on the basis of results rather than process  (  separate issue which is discussed below )  


-  But at its most effective ,  compensation is  tool for achieving sales performance consistent with marketing strategy ,   key means of guiding effort toward desired results 


-  This view has two important implications:  (  )  compensation ,  evaluation ,  and other motivational procedures should be linked coherently in the sales management system; and  (  )  despite the importance of individual abilities in sales ,  the sales rep is ,  ultimately ,  not an individual contributor within the organization; he or she should be viewed as the agent of the firms marketing strategy ,  and the compensation plan designed accordingly 


-  ,  Issues of compensation ,  evaluation ,  and motivation do not ,  of course ,  have strict cause and effect relationships 


-  However ,  it is useful to risk oversimplification and consider them as links in  chain in order to illustrate certain relationships that tend to be ignored  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  Motivation is  core function of management 


-  At the heart of most managerial responsibilities is the question ,  How do  get other people to do as much as possible of the right kind of work?3 In sales ,  motivation involves many factors 


-  One factor is the recruitment policies which influence the personal characteristics of salespeople  (  


-  Some people work harder than others ,  and some people are smarter than others 


-   second factor is the salespersons territory or account characteristics ,  which define the opportunities available and often provide direction for the salespersons efforts 


-  The salespersons perceptions of the connections among effort ,  results ,  and rewards constitute  third factor 


-  In some instances ,  working harder or smarter may not translate into better sales results due to the firms product policy ,  pricing ,  or competitive situation; in other instances ,  better efforts by the salesperson may indeed lead to better sales results ,  but the firms measurement ,  compensation ,  and recognition systems may not acknowledge them 


-  Finally ,   fourth factor affecting motivation is the perceived value of additional rewards 


-  Effort ,  results ,  and rewards may be linked ,  but salespeople may perceive the effort as disproportionately high relative to the rewards received 


-  Many sales incentive systems ,  for example ,  pay salespeople for incremental volume increases over previous years results ,  intending to motivate salespeople to develop new business 


-  But in many selling situations ,  the effort required to develop this business is perceived as not worth it by the sales rep who has  base of mature but steady accounts in his or her territory 


-  ,  An outcome of motivation is effort ,  which ,  in sales ,  has two dimensions: quantity and type 


-  Quantity refers to the sheer amount of effort expended by salespeople as measured by call frequency ,  number of accounts ,  orders booked ,  or other relevant activities 


-  Type refers to such factors as the focus of the salesforces account development versus account maintenance activities ,  the relative emphasis on new versus established products ,  or  ( in some situations )  an emphasis on selling products that generate revenue and manufacturing volume versus products that may have higher margins but lower unit sales 


-  Compensation plans influence both dimensions of effort 


-  ,  Effort leads to results 


-  The issue in sales compensation is deciding what goals should be established in an attempt to guide efforts toward desired results 


-  Some important choices in setting goals and rewarding results will be discussed in  later section 


-  ,  Having established goals ,  results must be measured ,  raising issues of the appropriate  ( or feasible )  measurement criteria ,  the information systems available to provide the data for such measurements ,  and the process by which evaluations are conducted 


-  There are many possible criteria for evaluating sales performance 


-  Often ,  however ,  the companys information systems do not gather the relevant data ,  or salesforce call reports  ( an important source of sales data in most companies )  may be noisy or unreliable 


-  Equally important ,  but often overlooked ,  is the process for administering the evaluations 


-  At many companies ,  salespeople receive big bonuses for the results of their efforts 


-  But the process of providing this additional compensation is at odds with the companys formal performance evaluation of that personthat is ,  the basis of the bonus  (  


-  ,  orders booked by an individual rep )  often contradicts what the company and sales managers say they want in individual performance-evaluation sessions  (  


-  ,  cross-referrals ,  joint presentations ,  or other aspects of team selling )  


-  The result is demotivation or ,  perhaps worse ,  motivation toward the wrong type of sales effort 


-  We may pay for product ,  not process ,  but if we ignore process in  sales environment ,  we often dont get what weve paid for 


-  ,  Finally ,  managers must consider the mechanics of the compensation plan both type and quantity 


-  Type refers to issues such as the relative emphasis on base salary or incentive pay; quantity refers both to the total amount of compensation provided relative to industry norms and ,  within  sales organization ,  the amount of compensation provided for performing  given sales task 


-  ,  The important point stressed here ,  however ,  is that there are links  ( intended or unintended )  between sales compensation ,  evaluation ,  and motivation 


-  The framework sketched in Figure  provides the following advice to managers: Start with the engine  ( the types of efforts and behavior desired of salespeople )  ,  and then design the transmission  ( the specific compensation plan aimed at encouraging these efforts )  


-  ,  Developing and implementing  sales compensation plan requires an analytical process that answers the five questions examined in this section 


-  ,  The starting point for analyzing sales-management requirements ,  including compensation ,  should be the nature of the sales task 


-  This means considering the competitive environment ,  the firms marketing strategy in that environment  ( overall and by segment )  ,  and the essential functions to be performed by the salespeople 


-  But developing  compensation plan requires disaggregating this category into its constituent parts: How much of selling in  given market is attention to delivery? Price negotiations? Distributor network relations? Customer education? Technical expertise? Personal relationships? Services of various kinds? Cold calling? Sheer persistence? ,  Moreover ,  the relative importance of these various aspects changes over the course of  product life cycle or as competition in an industry evolves 


-  In the early stages of  products life cycle ,  for instance ,  customer education or applications development are often key sales tasks ,  especially for technically complex products 


-  But as the market develops and standards emerge ,  salespeople typically spend more time selling against functionally equivalent brands or developing working relationships with intermediaries as well as end users 


-  Such was the case at  number of computer manufacturers during much of the 1980s 


-  As hardware margins declined ,  many computer firms franchised distributors ,  value-added resellers  ( VARs )  ,  and other intermediaries ,  often establishing  certain order-volume size below which sales were to be made through intermediaries 


-  Then ,  as networking and common product interfaces began to emerge ,  manufacturers found it difficult to differentiate themselves on the basis of the price or performance characteristics of their hardware 


-  Software applications and the assembly of different manufacturers products into networked packages became key in many market segments; VARs ,  focused on specific industry or occupational groups ,  often had the expertise and customer contacts for these functions 


-  But many manufacturers provided little or no incentive for their direct sales-forces to work with these influential intermediaries through cross-referrals ,  training ,  joint sales calls ,  or help with specific applications 


-  Indeed ,  at many companies ,  the compensation plan effectively encouraged salespeople to sell at the end-user level against the intermediary; frequently the manufacturer and its reseller both lost the sale 


-  ,  One reason for this misfit in  changing marketplace is that the people making important sales compensation decisions at many firms tend to be headquarters marketing or personnel managers 


-  They may have been in the field some years previously ,  but now base their compensation decisions on an obsolete vision of the actual tasks facing field sales personnel 


-  The lesson here is that there is finally no substitute for ongoing field interaction ,  including actual sales calls ,  by those responsible for sales compensation decisions 


-  This qualitative information is  necessary complement to hard aggregate data about the companys customers and markets ,  and  key step in developing ,  and maintaining ,   coherent ,  relevant picture of important sales tasks 


-  If ,  for example ,  wining and dining or attendance at industry trade shows are important aspects of the sales task ,  then the compensation plans treatment of expenses should not discourage salespeople from developing the contacts ,  relationships ,  and knowledge accrued through these activities 


-  ,  What is the nature of the selling cycle? The answer to this question often varies by major account or important segment 


-  But  plan that focuses on short-term incentives will almost certainly discourage attention to the longer-term  ( and ,  often ,  higher margin )  accounts or market segments 


-  ,  What are the controllable and uncontrollable factors? Salespeople cannot control some of the factors that affect sales performance  (  


-  ,  macro-economic developments ,   customers unforeseen demise ,  competitive moves )  


-  The compensation plan can encourage attention to these factors by rewarding accurate forecasting or market intelligence ,  but the plan should focus on the factors that the salesperson can control 


-  If not ,  important links between motivation ,  effort ,  results ,  and compensation are broken 


-  ,  Information about the amount and kind of compensation offered by competitors is always around the sales office ,  and comparisons are inevitable 


-   firm with uncompetitive pay levels will inevitably lose its best sales personnel ,  and perhaps inadvertently fuel what one sales manager calls the finishing-school syndrome: At my previous company ,  we hired relatively new people ,  trained them ,  gave them experience selling in this industry ,  and then ,  like me ,  they moved on to better-paying jobs at competitors 


-  Many companies spend  considerable amount of time determining competitive pay levels ,  yet this information is easily available through trade publications or published surveys 


-  ,  An additional issue in determining labor-pool context concerns the salespersons potential influence on the buying decision and the abilities required to exert this influence 


-  In many industries ,  sales requires technical skills ,  which means companies must recruit highly trained personnel who often have  number of options in different industries and in different functions besides sales 


-  This factor affects pay levels independent of competitors wage rates 


-  These assets are specialized knowledge and working relationships built up over time by the people selling  product ,  and specialized to the task of selling that product 


-  They may include technical skills or simply detailed knowledge of the decision makers and decision-making processes at important accounts 


-  When salespeople have developed such transaction-specific assets ,  the costs of losing these sales personnel may be prohibitive ,  and the compensation plan should reflect this 


-  ,  An example of such  situation is the private banking business  (  


-  During the past decade ,  most commercial banks aggressively pursued the sizable fee income ,  high margins ,  and large and stable deposit base that  productive private banking group can produce 


-  The key to this business is the private banker ,  who must possess an array of company-specific and client-specific skills 


-  Private banking positions require individuals with knowledge of  broad range of areas ,  including credit ,  marketing ,  operations ,  and special products 


-  Referrals ,  leads ,  and effective attention from other parts of the bank are crucial 


-  At the same time ,  personalized client service is the heart of the business ,  especially since any one banks products are not highly differentiated from competitors offerings 


-  Trust ,  compatibility ,  and other elements of good chemistry are the essence of the private banker-client relationship and ,  over time ,  most clients see themselves as doing business with an individual private banker rather than the commercial bank 


-  This combination of skills is rare ,  narrowing the pool of qualified candidates for private banking positions ,  and also highly dependent on accumulated transaction-specific experience with the company and the client 


-  As  result ,  compensation for private bankers  ( traditionally ,  in keeping with banks historical adherence to internal compensation parity ,   salary commensurate with that of the banks other commercial lenders )  increased in the 1980s at annual rates two to three times that of other bank categories 


-  ,  Management must also determine the relative emphasis on fixed salary and incentive compensation  ( commissions ,  bonuses ,  etc 


-  Several factors make  higher salary component attractive: the difficulty in measuring the impact of  salespersons performance in  reasonable period of time; the need for salespeople to coordinate efforts  (  


-  ,  team selling or national account programs )  the complexity and length of the selling task; the importance of nonselling activities such as after-sale services; the amount of missionary selling required; and the volatility of demand in  product market 


-  ,  These factors tend to make salary  more important factor than incentives in the total sales compensation mix 


-  But  company can have  highly leveraged  (  


-  ,  high commission component )  compensation plan and still sell highly technical ,  complex products in  market environment where non-selling activities and long-term relationships are importantif other aspects of the sales management system support the required sales tasks 


-   number of manufacturers rep firms selling high-technology products operate very successfully with highly leveraged compensation plans 


-  Also ,  many sales managers stress that the issues of fixed salary and incentive compensation  ( the focus of most academic discussions and models of compensation )  may be less important than issues such as: the time frame for compensation pay-outs and performance evaluations; the way sales credit is divided among  dispersed account team or different sales groups; the unit (  )  of measurement used to coordinate compensation plans among different salespeople  (  


-  ,  units sold or gross profit )  and the role of any compensation plan  ( fixed salary or more leveraged )  in the context of the sales organizations more general reward and recognition systems 


-  ,  reaching certain decision makers at  key account )  ,  or they can be administered at the discretion of  particular manager 


-  Most companies apply  standard commission rate to all sales ,  while others vary the commission rate by product or category of customer in order to reflect profitability or competitive objectives 


-  ,  Managers should pay close attention to these details 


-  Salespeople study their firms plan closely ,  and many look for what managers often call loopholes and what  salesperson might well call the best use of my time in order to maximize income 


-  Apparently incidental matters ,  such as paying commissions when orders are booked instead of when shipped ,  can make major differences in the companys cash flow ,  order patterns ,  production schedules ,  and focus of selling efforts 


-  Hence ,  the specific company context is crucial 


-  ,  First ,  sales incentives typically have three allied purposes:  (  )  to communicate managements goals and direct salesforce efforts;  (  )  to increase return on investment in the firms sales capacity; and  (  )  to provide competitive pay to salespeople 


-  Like wages ,  compensation plans are always important company communications 


-  The issue is ,  what behavior is encouraged or discouraged by the incentive portion of the plan?  related issue concerns the incremental efforts to be encouraged by the incentive plan 


-  In effect ,  the purpose of incentives is to increase the firms return on its investment in sales resources by directing effort toward areas where both the firm and the individual salesperson can prosper 


-  Finally ,  the incentive system should be structured so that ,  given  good performance ,  total compensation is at or above competitive pay levels; given varying performance scenarios ,  the ensuing spread in incentive pay should be meaningful and appropriate 


-  In general ,  it should be short enough to make an impact but long enough to make each payment significant 


-  The principle here is that the time frame should make the cause-and-effect relationships among effort ,  results ,  and rewards visible to the salesforce 


-  Generally ,  this means trying to establish incentive plans that conform to the typical selling cycle encountered by salespeople 


-  ,  Third ,  establishing the overall mix between incentive pay and salary  ( the majority of compensation systems have both )  involves judging the interplay of four key variables: the percentage of total compensation at risk via incentives; the salesforces perceptions about this proportion of incentive pay; the degree of implied management control; and the degree of fixed cost reduction attainable through incentive  ( rather than fixed salary )  compensation 


-  As an example ,   senior sales manager in an office products business  ( where the average total compensation per salesperson was about $50 , 000 in 1987 )  uses Table  to consider the interplay of these variables 


-  ,  Fourth ,  the performance measures on which incentives are based should reflect important managerial objectives 


-  While sales volume is probably the most common measure used for incentive systems ,  there are other possible performance measures 


-  For example: ,  Clearly ,  no one form of sales compensation plan is optimal for all companies ,  or even for different divisions in the same company 


-  The nature of the sales tasks ,  and the nature of the salespersons influence on the buying decision  (  factor affected by marketing strategy )  ,  will help to indicate the most suitable form 


-  ,   key choice in any compensation system is the process adopted for setting goals and rewarding results 


-  This is  complex issue ,  involving the mechanics of the particular compensation system ,  the information and administrative talent available to the company ,  and ,  in most situations ,  questions about the basic social contract  company seeks to establish with its sales personnel 


-  There are two basic approaches available ,  as suggested by Figure  


- 11 ,  An emphasis on product over process generally leads to the approach outlined on the left side of Figure  


-  Management sets goals ,  sends the sales-force out into the field ,  and waits for results 


-  It rewards on the basis of whether or not the goals are met 


-  The reasoning here is that  (  )  the salesperson can best decide how to meet those goals  ( Isnt that what we pay them for ,  anyway? )   (  )  over time ,   natural selection process will retain the best salespeople while the others leave for lack of rewards; and  (  )  salespeople are inherently entrepreneurs who resist attempts to control the focus of their field activities 


-  ,  In the approach outlined on the right side of Figure  ,  management rewards specific activities aimed at achieving the desired results and attempts to directly influence those results 


-  This approach assumes first that ,  in the absence of clearly defined and prioritized sales activities ,  the salesperson may not be the best person to design  strategy for reaching goals; sales managers should understand the sales tasks facing their company and improve the performance of those tasks  ( Isnt that what managers get paid for ,  anyway? )  


-  Second ,  over time ,  the former approach can significantly waste and misdirect effort by salespeople ,  especially since the most productive sales activities are likely to change during  products life cycle or as  market grows and matures 


-  Third ,  salespeople may well be entrepreneurs ,  but successful entrepreneurs typically endorse processes that increase their earnings; the issue is not whether salespeople like to be told what to do ,  but whether the company exerts its influence on salespeople in the right directions 


-  Ultimately ,  the function of management is not to administer tests but to optimize the allocation of resources ,  including sales resources 


-  ,  These philosophical differences have significant implications 


-  The choice of approach affects all major dimensions of sales managementrecruitment criteria ,  training initiatives ,  first-level sales management ,  performance evaluation criteria ,  and compensation 


-  Further ,  as international markets ,  global accounts ,  team-selling activities ,  and new technologies make the selling process more complex in many industries ,  the essentially laissez-faire approach outlined on the left side of Figure  is effective in fewer situations 


-  However ,  many companies adopt this approach without considering the alternative method ,  because they think it is not applicable 


-  ,  You wont get what you dont pay for is  fact of life in most sales organizations 


-  But compensation issues are ultimately what some writers have called organizational hygiene factors:12 necessary ,  but not sufficient ,  conditions for motivating people to do what you want them to do 


-   compensation plan is  part of ,  not  substitute for ,   coherent sales management system 


-  ,  Developing an outstanding salesforce is ,  in the final analysis ,   function of the firms total environment ,  including its external market and internal organization  ( management ,  value ,  and information systems )  


-  While  sales compensation plan affects the companys revenue stream and its pattern of resource allocations in many areas besides sales ,  problems with sales compensation are often really symptoms of weaknesses in sales management or other areas of the firm 


-  As noted earlier ,  moreover ,  many other factors besides compensation affect sales results 


-  These include economic conditions ,  competitive initiatives ,  pricing ,  and product quality 


-  ,  Hence ,  it is important to recognize both the relevance and limits of compensation issues 


-  In analyzing sales situations ,  consider the following four factors as part of  quick audit of sales management policies and practices: ,  Evaluating comparative pay levels and deciding the relative emphasis of fixed salary or commission compensation are the outputs of the process outlined here and ,  in many respects ,  the easier aspects of compensation design 


-  Managers also sensitive to issues of motivation ,  evaluation criteria ,  goal setting ,  and rewards ,  can avoid unpleasant surprises and misdirected effort ,  both by themselves and field salespeople 


-  First ,  it suggests  framework that places in context some of the topics discussed in this article ,  such as compensation systems ,  the analysis of sales tasks ,  and the role of sales management in influencing types of selling behavior 


-  Second ,  it includes aspects of sales management not discussed here but that are nonetheless important in analyzing sales situations and compensation issues 


-  Salesforce control systems refers to aspects of sales management that are relatively quantitative and measurable ,  and susceptible to management by objectives ,  or policy direction by sales management 


-  It includes performance measurement ,  evaluation ,  compensation ,  and training systems 


-  In contrast ,  salesforce environment refers to more qualitative issues concerning human resource patterns  (  


-  ,  management of conflicts )  ,  and management patterns  (  


-  ,  the way goals are set and results rewarded )  


-  For example ,  what  company measures and rewards will affect its sales process; conversely ,  how salespeople interact should affect what  company decides to measure ,  train ,  and reward 


-  In turn ,  both the control systems and environment will affect the focus of the companys sales personnel ,  their types of selling behavior ,  and their performance of required sales tasks 


-  ,  Using the framework in Figure  ,   manager contemplating  change in sales compensation might first want to consider the following questions: ,  The basic idea behind this framework is that  sales management system must integrate three factors internal to the sales organization with two factors external to the sales organization 


-  The internal factors are the following: ,  The external factors are as follows: ,  The external factors largely determine the nature of required sales tasks; the internal factors influence selling behaviors to ensure optimal performance of those tasks 


-  ,  When these factors are coherently integrated ,  the company is focusing on customer encounters ,  and selling has travelled  long way toward effective marketing
