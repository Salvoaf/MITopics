-  They want to know ,  What is supply-chain management ,  really ,  for me and my company? We have been researching that question for the past 10 years ,  working with executives in many different industries to understand how supply-chain management is applied in each context and how it is changing the way managers think about their businesses 


-  )  ,  The best way to understand the impact of  long-term trend is to examine how the trend has changed the way executives view their businesses and what issues they choose to focus on 


-  Much of the disappointment with industry initiatives  ( such as ECR )  and major software projects  ( such as ERP ,  enterprise-resource-planning implementations ,  or supply-chain planning software )  can be traced to  managerial focus on enablers rather than on the business problems 


-  Although connectivity  ( say ,  through electronic data interchange or the Internet )  and new applications software  ( such as ERP systems and supply-chain-optimization software )  have acted as enablers ,  the rethinking of how organizations align goals and make decisions is the essence of cross-enterprise integration 


-  As  result of the more demanding business environment ,  both physical costs and market-mediation costs have risen for many companies 


-  In innovative industries that are highly responsive to changing fashions and for which demand is unpredictable ,  market-mediation costs dominate 


-  ,  Although supply-chain management deals with both aspects ,  many recent innovations have focused on measuring and addressing market-mediation costs 


-  There are three reasons why companies have been slow to address market-mediation costs 


-  ,  In the 1997 article ,  What Is the Right Supply Chain for Your Products? Marshall Fisher argued that for industries with high market-mediation costs ,  supply chains should be set up to respond quickly to unpredictable demand 


-  In addition ,  they invest in improving their understanding of demand and managing it 


-  The bullwhip effect has been observed by managers in  vast array of industries ,  and in every case it has increased both physical distribution and market-mediation costs 


-  For example ,  7-Eleven Japan captures point-of-sale data along with basic shopper demographics to improve its understanding of what drives demand for its  , 000 stock-keeping units  ( SKUs )  throughout the day 


-  The company increased its profitability dramatically by understanding the costs of discounts ,  markdowns and lost sales  and working to improve problem areas 


-  ,  Other companies ,  such as Long Drug Stores ,  have learned the value of fine-tuning relative prices for competing brands offered at  particular retail store ,  using an understanding of price elasticity of demand and profitability for the two brands 


-  That understanding has led product designers to consider supply-chain-management issues during the early phases of product development 


-  ,  Because high-clock-speed industries produce innovative products that have high market-mediation costs ,  postponement strategies also can be effective 


-  Whereas Dell uses  responsive build-to-order capability with no finished product inventory to dominate competitors who use  build-to-stock policy ,  IKEA uses  build-to-stock approach with increased product inventory to dominate slow build-to-order competitors 


-  They may conceive of  different way to go to market  to interact with customers  that drives them to implement  new supply chain that ,  together with the new go-to-market strategy ,  creates better value for the customer 


-  ,  OLD QUESTION: How should we organize our companys operations to serve the mass market efficiently while offering customized products? ,  NEW QUESTION: How should we organize the supply chain to serve each customer or segment uniquely and provide  tailored customer experience? ,  Breakthroughs in information technology have made it possible to communicate with ,  understand and provide tailored service to individual customers or segments on an ongoing basis as  means to increase loyalty ,  revenues and profits 


-  The same thing may be done implicitly for  set of customers ,  by understanding elasticities of demand and then changing relative prices of various products for individual market segments on the basis of those elasticities and relative profitability and availability of the products 


-  Whirlpool has developed  Web-based configurator  ( product-selection tool )  that allows housing developers to work with Whirlpool to create custom bundles of products that are appropriate for  specific housing development 


-  )  Information from CRM and pricing systems enables salespeople to understand demand elasticities and individual customer preferences better ,  thus allowing them to make more-appropriate sales proposals and increase both sales revenues and customer loyalty
