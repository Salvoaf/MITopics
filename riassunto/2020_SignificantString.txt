- To remain competitive over time ,   company must be able to move quickly in response to major changes in society ,  technology ,  competition ,  regulation ,  labor markets ,  and myriad other areas 


-  Yet the possibility of such changes creates deep uncertainty ,  making it challenging to identify the most profitable path forward 


-  Although organizations can never be fully prepared for an unanticipated shock ,  the most resilient ones learn to expect the unexpected ,  rebound quickly when it occurs ,  and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities that emerge 


-  ,  To help with those efforts ,  we have developed  framework that goes beyond traditional forecasting and risk-assessment exercises 


-  It consists of four sets of activities: First ,  develop  comprehensive set of processes to actively sense new insights  ( whether internal or external )  that could affect the business ,  and hence identify threats or opportunities as early as possible 


-  Second ,  organize in response to those threats or opportunities; this is likely to involve reallocating resources ,  revamping processes ,  filling capability gaps ,  and aligning the companys structure and governance 


-  Third ,  capture value by revising business models and restructuring relationships with other players in various ecosystems 


-  And fourth ,  renew the organizational capabilities needed to create and capture value by continuing to monitor and assess results and making small adjustments over time  while also preparing for the major disruptions that require  more comprehensive overhaul 


-  ,  This approach is based on the principle of dynamic capabilities ,  which holds that companies need to continually adapt their resources to respond to rapidly changing and unpredictable environments 


-  Dynamic-capabilities-based models are the subject of  large and growing body of strategic management literature 


-  Our framework synthesizes key lessons from this literature and provides  way forward for managers to revitalize their companys processes ,  structures ,  and business models  and to compete effectively  in  highly dynamic business environment 


-  ,   few decades ago ,  companies could build  strong business model and apply it more or less unchanged for years 


-  Consider that ,  in the early 1970s ,  nearly 80% of the most profitable publicly traded companies remained in the top quartile of performance for at least six years out of the previous 10 


-  Today ,  that is no longer true ,  as relentless innovation and disruption threaten established business models ,  leading to far greater churn among top performers in virtually all industries 


-  Resilience now depends on rapid and effective adaptation to change 


-  ,  Nokia is  good example of how change and unexpected competition can upend even highly successful businesses 


-  Founded in Finland in 1865 as  paper mill ,  the company later diversified and eventually became one of Europes leading electronics companies in the 1970s 


-  It introduced its first mobile phone in 1987 ,  and by the end of the 1990s it had become the largest cellphone manufacturer in the world 


-  But the company was overtaken by new competition from Apples iPhone and Googles Android mobile operating system 


-  By 2016 ,  Nokia was out of the phone business altogether  an extremely rapid reversal for  market leader 


-  ,  Contrast that with Netflix ,  which anticipated  large shift in technology and was thus able to adjust its strategy to capitalize on it 


-  In the early 2000s ,  Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings committed resources at the exclusively DVD-by-mail company to build  streaming service  well before home internet services had sufficient bandwidth to support it 


-  Netflix first offered streaming in 2007 as  free bonus to DVD renters and then ,  in 2011 ,  separated the DVD and streaming offerings 


-  Mail-order subscribers left in droves ,  yet it was the right realignment in response to changes in how people consumed media 


-  And it led to tremendous success for Netflix  its streaming business grew from 10 million subscribers in 2010 to over 160 million in 2020 


-  ,  Making such prescient moves requires  structured way of looking out over the horizon and anticipating whats coming 


-  Drawing on the rich vein of dynamic-capabilities thinking ,  we propose the following model 


-  Although most organizations have some sensing activities in place ,  they often lack  systematic approach to gathering and sharing critical information 


-  To successfully anticipate change ,  organizations must be designed for ,  and become accustomed to ,  gathering and sharing information from  wide range of sources ,  such as current and former customers ,  strategic partners ,  internal R&D staff ,  customer-facing employees ,  suppliers ,  local and regional stakeholders ,  university labs ,  boards of directors and advisers ,  trade media ,  and current and anticipated competitors 


-  Big data and machine learning techniques can be used to tease out insights from combinations of the internal and external data streams 


-  Therefore ,  organizational design must foster the free flow of information from gathering points to wherever it may be relevant  for example ,  by ensuring that visible processes and incentive systems encourage collaboration and interaction 


-  And when the future is particularly hard to read ,  leaders must distill insights by creating  range of scenarios and then developing ,  testing ,  and retesting hypotheses 


-  ,  These principles of sensing can be seen in action at Progressive ,  one of the largest auto insurers in the  


-  Progressive offers customers  mobile app called Snapshot that allows the company to capture billions of miles of driving data so it can provide finely segmented ,  usage-based rates 


-  It combines that information with data from the marketing ,  claims ,  and policy service departments in  repository that can be accessed by analysts and managers throughout the organization via  dashboard 


-  Progressive also created the Business Innovation Garage ,   secure space where any employee can rapidly prototype and test new offerings 


-  Leaders also need to build flexible structures and processes that enable the organization to innovate and embrace change 


-   key aspect of organizing is filling capability gaps that arise when  company enters  new market or revamps its business model 


-  ,  In the mid-1990s ,  Samsung committed to building  capability in industrial design  an effort that took several years and included opening  multidisciplinary in-house design institute along with design bureaus in Europe ,  the  


-  To maintain flexibility as products are developed ,  Samsung often has multiple design and engineering teams working on similar products and eventually launches the ones that are best suited to current market conditions 


-  Samsungs intentionally developed design capability and its skill at reallocating resources where needed were critical to the companys expansion into smartphones from its traditional base in home appliances and consumer electronics 


-  Despite  slow start in the smartphone sector  ( Samsungs first Android-based devices debuted in mid-2010 ,  three years after Apple launched the iPhone )  ,  the company quickly grew to dominate the worldwide smartphone market 


-  ,  The best approach to organizing will vary depending on  companys circumstances ,  but several principles are widely applicable 


-  For example ,  companies can often become more responsive and innovative by flattening management hierarchies and decentralizing decision-making authority 


-  However ,  when they decentralize ,  they need to find ways to keep people moving toward shared goals to prevent chaos 


-   companys culture  including its mission ,  values ,  and management style  can provide that sense of direction 


-  But that culture should be entrepreneurial rather than bureaucratic  for example ,  ensuring that small ,  early failures lead to learning rather than blaming 


-  As weve seen time and again ,  the most innovative organizations also are open to thoughtful criticism that forces the holders of the consensus view to sharpen  ( or ,  in some cases ,  abandon )  their thinking 


-  Capturing value requires leaders to execute strategic priorities by orchestrating their companys tangible and intangible assets  such as capital ,  strategic partnerships ,  and intellectual property  as well as making changes to business models as required 


-  Amazon ,  for example ,  developed proprietary technology infrastructure to enable its unprecedented scale advantage over competing online retailers 


-  It subsequently leveraged that very IT architecture in order to create  highly profitable cloud computing business ,  an operation that now funds many of its other strategic initiatives 


-  ,  Maximizing value capture also entails determining which activities can safely be outsourced and which ones must be retained in-house because they are critical to  companys product road map or value delivery system  ( or both )  


- 10 Finally ,  operating discipline is an important contributor to capturing and retaining value in the enterprise 


-  Sensing activities will inevitably call the wider status quo into question and will sometimes even require that companies overhaul their entire identity 


- 11 Yet for each of the successful renewals mentioned above ,  many other companies have failed to see themselves and their situations with fresh eyes ,  including Kodak ,  Blockbuster ,  and Yahoo ,  to name just  few 


- 12 ,  Renewal is best seen as  continuous endeavor 


-  Between major transitions ,  there is often value in tuning up the companys culture ,  organization ,  and routines 


-  That includes considering changes to incentive systems ,  reporting structures ,  decision-making ,  and business processes 


-  ,  Moreover ,  as these changes are made ,  they generate new data 


- 13 In that sense ,  this fourth component of the framework includes continually assessing results and revising the first three components 


-  ,  The four sets of activities and capabilities defined above  sensing ,  organizing ,  capturing ,  and renewing  are not meant to be implemented sequentially 


-  Rather ,  they are tightly interlinked; as information continuously flows back and forth ,  the underlying behaviors and processes should change accordingly 


-  More than any individual activity ,  managing the connections across all four areas enables an organization to become more resilient 


-  For example ,  feedback from activities that capture value ,  such as an unexpectedly poor monthly sales report ,  could trigger  greater focus on sensing activities  thereby leading the sales or engineering staffs to restructure their interactions with external partners and customers in order to seek feedback ,  test the validity of existing assumptions ,  and revise operating plans 


-  ,  Another key point is that these processes dont run on  specified timetable 


-  In any company with mature dynamic capabilities ,  sensing activities ,  for example ,  continually generate new insights ,  which must be processed quickly by leaders at the divisional or corporate level 


-  As new conjectures are tested and accepted or rejected ,  subsequent sets of activities to sense ,  organize ,  capture value ,  and/or renew should begin as soon as the evidence suggests theyre needed  not when the budget cycle creates an opening 


-  ,  One industry facing significant uncertainty is automobile manufacturing 


-  Carmakers are dealing with technology changes such as electrification and autonomy ,  new forms of competition from ride sharing ,  and regulatory changes 


-  Given those variables ,  the dynamic-capabilities model could be used by an incumbent auto manufacturer faced with the emergence of autonomous vehicle  ( AV )  technologies 


-  Large-scale investments are already being made by numerous competitors as well as new market entrants  ( including device makers and software developers )  ,  despite the lack of  clear path to profit 


-  ,  The dynamic and highly uncertain nature of AV ecosystems demands structured sensing activities to monitor changes in the landscape 


-  Market strategists from most organizations review relevant news sources ,  attend conferences ,  and engage outside experts 


-  If self-driving technology becomes standardized and universal ,  for example ,  car manufacturers may no longer compete on handling characteristics but rather on interior amenities such as infotainment packages or other custom features 


-  Disparate sources of information about new technologies ,  emerging business models ,  and tactics pursued by new and existing rivals must be assessed ,  calibrated ,  and integrated  and then distributed to the appropriate places where leaders can use that information to inform business model decisions and resource allocations 


-  It is essential to align both new and existing businesses within the companys strategy ,  structure ,  governance models ,  and critical processes 


-  ,  Perhaps the biggest issue facing automobile manufacturers is the need to formulate new potential business models to capture value  for example ,  considering whether to continue operating primarily as an OEM or expand into mobility as  service ,  short-term leasing ,  fleet management ,  or other services 


-  Another critical decision centers on the timing of market entry 


-   companys strategy ,  assets ,  and capabilities may position it to be  market pioneer ,  or they might suggest  less risky fast follower approach 


-  While AV technologies and ecosystems are still too embryonic for anything more than limited trials ,  working hypotheses about their rollout and about key bottleneck assets enable  company to decide which capabilities are needed in order to test its forecasts about the future 


-  Part of this involves determining which capabilities should be owned ,  contracted for ,  or leveraged through alliances   distribution that may change as the business ecosystem evolves 


-  Leaders must continually update future scenarios ,  consider the implications for corporate identity and mission ,  determine how best to fill missing-but-needed skill sets ,  and take proactive steps to shape new ecosystems as they emerge 


-  If an OEM concludes that AVs are critically important to the future of its industry ,  top management must frequently question their companys state of readiness  as well as continuously monitor the alignment of their underlying assumptions with signals generated from activities such as market trials and prototypes 


-  ,  In short ,  since the future is  moving target ,  leadership teams in this industry must anticipate multiple scenarios and develop the means to test them on  limited scale  with  keen eye toward organizational capabilities and skills gaps 


-  Participants must regularly update their estimated timelines for key technologies to be refined and introduced on  broad scale in order to provide reliable inputs into strategy formulation activities  since being too early to market is often just as costly as being too late 


-  If ,  for example ,  too many urban markets balk at implementing the infrastructure required for AVs to function safely ,  the current driver-based car culture could persist for decades to come 


-  Resilience requires  long-term ,  dogged commitment by the executive team to cultivate an innovative organizational culture and  mature set of dynamic organizational capabilities 


- Ever since the 1997 publication of The Innovators Dilemma ,  researchers ,  management experts ,  and businesspeople have discussed ,  dissected ,  and debated Clayton Christensens Theory of Disruptive Innovation 


-  By now ,  the arc of disruption is well established: We know how disrupters enter the market ,  and we know how incumbents typically bungle their responses to such seemingly insignificant competition 


-  Numerous books and articles have offered to solve the dilemma of disruption ,  including Christensens own The Innovators Solution  (  2003 book coauthored with Michael Raynor )  ,  which suggests that leaders who understand how disruption transpires can inoculate themselves against the threats and seize the opportunities 


-  ,  Yet ,  despite so much insight and advice ,  the dilemma persists: 63% of companies are currently experiencing disruption ,  and 44% are highly susceptible to it ,  according to research by Accenture 


-  And in  thorough analysis of more than  , 500 publicly listed companies ,  growth strategy consultancy Innosight found that only 52 of them ,  about 3% of the sample set ,  had made material progress in strategically transforming their organizations 


-  The default positions ,  it seems ,  are to squeeze extra points from profit margins ,  search for companies to acquire ,  or simply pay lip service to innovation by setting up token incubators or having executives wear jeans and the occasional hoodie 


-  ,  Why are companies still so vulnerable to disruptive threats? Our view is that it isnt about not having the right playbook 


-  The problem is that well-intentioned leaders often delude themselves by downplaying disruptive threats or overestimating the difficulty of response 


-  This article explains these delusions about disruption and offers ways to help leaders avoid self-sabotage 


-  ,  Christensen and Raynor have done  superb job of creating  framework for helping to understand industry dynamics and for planning your own growth alternatives 


-  It was on the brink of taking over the booming cellphone market 


-  Over the next few years ,  the company would grow into  seemingly unstoppable force 


-  Then ,  in November 2007 ,  Forbes ran  prophetic cover with the headline ,  Nokia: One Billion Customers  Can Anyone Catch the Cell Phone King? ,  Well ,  yes 


-  ,  Despite having dominant market share ,  despite having the resources and capabilities to transition to the smartphone era ,  and despite having  leader who endorsed and presumably understood Christensens groundbreaking theories on disruption  ( though Ala-Pietil ,  admittedly ,  left the company in 2005 )  ,  Nokia stumbled 


-  Apple famously entered the market mid-2007 


-  Google formed the Open Handset Alliance ,  powered by the Android operating system ,  later that year 


-  In 2013 ,  CEO Stephen Elop sold Nokias ailing cellphone business to Microsoft for roughly $7 billion 


-   year later ,  Microsoft took  roughly $7 billion write-down on the transaction ,  suggesting the business was worthless 


-  ,  Nokias fall is just one of many cautionary tales: Eastman Kodak ,  Blockbuster ,  and Toys  Us were all destroyed by disruption 


-  Some of todays great companies look to be similarly snared in their own innovators dilemma 


-  FedEx started in classic disruptive fashion but today is under threat from Amazon ,  which could hollow out  significant portion of FedExs core business by picking off high-value lines between hubs ,  leaving FedEx  ( and UPS )  with small ,  unprofitable routes 


-  Netflix lacks the diverse portfolio these businesses have ,  and it may be overly focused on mainstream customers while ignoring the needs of less profitable ones ,  like all of those young people who prefer creating and sharing short-form videos on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok instead of watching shows like The Crown 


-  New habit formation is often an early warning sign of disruptive change 


-  For all its innovation prowess ,  why hasnt Netflix visibly pursued growth opportunities beyond video streaming and long-form content creation? ,  And why ,  after so many years since Christensen presented his original theory and so many cautionary tales ,  do leaders continue to miss the warning signs? Our view is that the disruptive playbooks leadership section is incomplete 


-  Leaders must learn how to build the individual and organizational capability to confront powerful self-deceptions that inhibit successfully dealing with disruption 


-  ,  Powerful deceptions hinder  leaders ability to respond to disruptive threats and seize disruptive opportunities 


-  Christensens original research highlighted one such deception ,  noting how ,  ironically ,  listening to your best customers drives the innovators dilemma 


-  Companies typically focus on satisfying their best customers  ( usually their most profitable ones )  by providing better versions of current solutions while ignoring their worst customers ,  the ones most likely to flock to cheaper or more convenient disruptive solutions 


-  This is because data lags disruptive change 


-  BlackBerry is  good example 


-  He dismissed the iPhone ,  didnt mention Android ,  and smugly said ,  I dont look up too much or down too much 


-  But consider BlackBerrys performance at the time and over the next few years that followed 


-  When Balsillie gave the interview ,  BlackBerry  ( then called Research in Motion )  had just reported revenues double those in the previous fiscal year ,  to roughly $6 billion 


-  Over the next three years ,  revenues tripled ,  reaching  peak of close to $20 billion 


-  ,  Ironically ,  leaders can be adept at spotting disruption in other industries and yet be blind to whats going on right in front of their eyes 


-  Kodaks case focused on digital imaging ,  for example ,  while Hallmarks focused on online greeting cards 


-  I thought this was going to be the most boring event ever ,  admits Clark Gilbert ,  an HBS professor at the time and now president of BYU-Pathway Worldwide 


-  None of the companies could see their own problem 


-  Mark Bertolini of Aetna provides  good example of  leader who didnt wait that long to act 


-  It would have been easy for Bertolini to execute yesterdays strategy for five years and ride off into the sunset 


-  Instead ,  Bertolini made the courageous decision to dramatically reconfigure the business ,  which ultimately resulted in Aetnas game-changing merger with CVS Health in early 2018 ,   first-of-its-kind combination of retail pharmacy and insurance capabilities 


-  The combination creates the potential for more affordable access to urgent and primary care 


-  The company was seeking to set  bold new direction and achieve ambitious performance targets 


-  Its leadership identified an opportunity to drive step-change growth by ,  for the first time in its history ,  bypassing traditional distributors to deliver highly customized products directly to end consumers 


-  The strategy would require substantial commitment ,  but it also promised substantial returns ,  including the ability to spur growth ,  combat commoditization ,  and increase margins 


-  Despite consensus and  serious commitment among the executive leadership team to the strategy ,  the outgoing and incoming board chairs decided  in the bathroom during  break  to significantly reduce the scope of the ambition ,  perceiving that leveraging digital technologies and bypassing traditional distributors was too risky and not in the companys short- and medium-term interests 


-  ,  The fear of messing up what has been  proven strategy is powerful ,  but the reality is that making bold investments in innovation doesnt carry systemic risks 


-  New Coke ,  Apples Newton ,  Microsofts Zune music player ,  Amazons Fire Phone ,  and Googles augmented reality glasses are all examples of big companies that made big bets that led to big write-offs 


-  But while none of these failures was good ,  of course ,  none sank their companies ,  either 


-  ,  Big moves look like they are really risky 


-  Because what you lose when you invest  ton of money is the money you invested 


-  When you win ,  you usually create not only an annuity but  new ecosystem that gives you the opportunity to win in new areas 


-  In the face of disruptive change ,  company leaders consistently invest too little ,  too slowly ,  in doing something different 


-  Walmart executives knew for years they had to embrace online retail ,  and yet from 1998 to 2015 ,  the company kept redirecting or scuttling significant investments to compete with Amazon and other e-retailers 


-  It didnt allow third-party sellers until 2009 and then for years had just six sellers on its website 


- com in 2016 has promise ,  but Walmart should have bet boldly years earlier when the capital investment required would have been much lower and the tolerance for losses  ( necessary to catch Amazon )  higher 


-  ,  Ironically ,  such late-breaking attempts to catch up on innovation after being too slow are often ,  wrongly ,  seen as proof that they offer systemic risk  Walmart is betting the store on its web strategy 


-  It might be The activists will pounce on me ,  or My shareholders wont like it ,  or The market just cares about short-term results 


-  Indeed ,  many leaders hide behind the maximize shareholder value maxim without understanding exactly what it means 


-  As Michael Mauboussin and Alfred Rappaport ,  prominent financial experts and coauthors of Expectations Investing ,  once noted: ,  Further ,  there are clear examples demonstrating that you can actively sell your shareholders on  new story ,  as long as it is indeed  convincing story and you demonstrate early success 


-  Aetnas Bertolini recalled  tense meeting early on in the companys strategic transformation where he fielded questions from investment banking analysts: I walked into  room of analysts and  said ,  You either think of me as stupid or that Im lying to you ,  neither of which makes me want to spend more time with you 


-   have had shareholders who have said to me ,  Why dont you double your dividends? Well ,   want to invest in the company 


-  So  said that one of my largest shareholders should get the hell out of my stock 


-  In 2018 ,  Harvard Business Review identified Bertolini as one of the 50 best-performing CEOs in the world and the highest-performing CEO in the health insurance industry 


-  Bertolinis decision to stand firm in the face of criticism helped drive Aetnas successful transformation 


-  4: My people arent up to the task 


-  Leaders often use their own people as an excuse not to take action 


-  For example ,  in 2018 ,  Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos told  group of CEOs that transforming his company had required turning over  staggering 80% of his top leadership team 


-  People resist change ,  he said 


- 10 Vounatsoss strategy underlines  popular perception that changing  company requires changing the staff 


-  The difficulty and pain of the rip and replace strategy is perhaps one reason why only 3% of companies researched by Innosight were embarking on significant strategic transformations 


-  ,  As  counterexample ,  DBS ,  the largest bank in Southeast Asia ,  went from  stodgy regulated bank to an innovative digital powerhouse without dramatically changing its workforce 


-  Soon after becoming CEO in 2009 ,  Piyush Gupta set  challenge: Given increasing technological change ,  DBS had to function like  27 , 000-person startup 


-  DBSs culture change effort rested on the fundamental belief that its staff had the inherent capabilities to become innovators but lacked the tools and support to realize them 


-  Under the leadership of Paul Cobban ,  chief data and transformation officer ,  the bank redesigned its offices ,  changed its meeting styles to encourage equal participation and greater collaboration ,  and introduced  new innovation team with an unusual mandate: Under absolutely no circumstances should the innovation team innovate 


-  Instead ,  the teams mission is to enable the broader community to incorporate the behaviors that enable successful innovation 


- 11 ,  To see these lies for what they are and successfully transform their organizations ,  leaders first need to transform themselves 


-  Successfully responding to disruption requires executives to simultaneously reinvent todays business while creating tomorrows business 


-  More specifically ,  they have to find new ways to solve customer problems while at the same time scoping out new growth opportunities 


-  The challenge isnt just that these missions are in conflict and involve periods of chaos and uncertainty; it also is that they require fundamentally different mindsets and approaches 


-  ,  Research by longtime Harvard professor Robert Kegan found that most leaders lack the cognitive flexibility required to toggle between being disciplined and entrepreneurial 


-  Kegan terms this flexibility self-transforming ,  where leaders have the ability to step back from and reflect on the limits of our own ideology or personal authority; see that any one system or self-organization is in some way partial or incomplete; be friendlier toward contradiction and opposites; [and] seek to hold on to multiple systems rather than project all except one onto the other 


- 13 ,  Its not surprising that so many leaders lack this capability 


-  Most grew up in  world that was either disciplined or entrepreneurial but rarely both and almost never both at the same time 


-  To transform themselves ,  leaders must focus more on mindsets ,  awareness ,  and inner capacities to combat basic biases that make it hard to make decisions in uncertainty and toggle between different frames 


-  More critical ,  and for our purposes here ,  mindfulness boosts awareness ,  increasing  persons ability to step back ,  pause ,  and become aware of not just habitual thought patterns ,  but also emotional reactions 


- 14 ,  Mindful leaders can ,  for example ,  see their reactivity ,  giving them the tools to identify and overcome the deceptions of disruption 


-   mindful leader is better at toggling between different mindsets:  disciplined focus on transforming todays business and more entrepreneurial thinking to create tomorrows business 


-  Mindfulness is  powerful ,  scientifically validated tool for improving self-awareness ,  which is  critical and underappreciated tool for senior leaders confronting the challenges of disruptive change 


-  ,  Some leaders who have successfully managed transformative change have touted the value of mindfulness 


- 15 ,  Another example of the power of mindfulness comes from Pierre Wack ,  who advanced and popularized the idea of scenario planning while working at Royal Dutch Shell in the 1970s and 1980s 


-  Successful scenario planning ,  Wack noted ,  requires being in the right state of focus to put your finger unerringly on the key facts or insights that unlock or open understanding 


- 16 He noted that the value of scenario planning is not about developing specific plans that will actually be implemented or getting to the right scenario but about helping leadership understand that the future can be dramatically different from the present ,  while fostering  deeper understanding of the forces driving potential changes and uncertainties 


-  The approach ,  he said ,  gives managers something very precious: the ability to reperceive reality 


- 17 By sharpening his ability to toggle between present reality and future possibility ,  Wack and his team transformed scenario planning from  passive manipulation of data into an active tool to stretch thinking and advance discussions 


-  This helped Shell to see what others missed and weather oil shocks in the 1970s and 1980s significantly better than its competitors 


-  For example ,   


-  Lafley drove substantial change at Procter  Gamble as CEO from 2000 to 2009 ,  but the company stumbled so badly when he stepped down that he was asked to return 


-  Lou Gerstner was an icon for transformation during his time at IBM ,  but by the time Sam Palmisano turned the CEO reins over to Ginni Rometty ,  IBM had missed the cloud computing revolution and its touted Watson platform was struggling to deliver results commensurate with its hype 


-  Single-shot leaders might have the personal ability to toggle between different mindsets ,  but they seem to struggle to codify core elements of their unique approach and institutionalize them 


-  ,  Kegan and coauthor Lisa Laskow Lahey noted in An Everyone Culture that you can create  deliberately developmental organization  ( DDO )  that consciously upgrades an entire organizations capacity to grapple with disruption 


-  Bridgewater ,  the worlds largest hedge fund ,  is  good example 


-  Some of the fundamental principles include radical transparency ,  where the goal is to review people accurately ,  not kindly; recognizing that internal exploration and struggle is important  ( pain  reflection  progress )  and sharing and supporting project work with complete transparency 


-  Bridgewater gives employee feedback not just to boost short-term performance but to enhance long-term capacity 


-  It consciously helps its employees develop reflective muscles to understand defensive routines and blind spots and to improve their ability to acquire ,  process ,  and make sense of multiple forms of data 


-  This commitment to developing everyones sense-making capacity as  mission-critical component of long-term performance sets DDOs like Bridgewater apart 


-  ,  Two final examples worth mentioning for their transformative efforts are SAP and Johnson  Johnson ,  which are helping staff develop creatively ,  emotionally ,  and mentally to tackle larger challenges such as disruption 


-  Recent efforts center on energy and performance ,  with  stated goal to help employees achieve full engagement in work and life 


-  Leaders serve as active role models for building these capabilities 


-  CEO Alex Gorsky ,  for example ,  has long worn  fitness tracker and speaks publicly about the link between mental well-being and productivity 


- 19 ,  In the first two decades of the 21st century ,  scholars and practitioners fine-tuned the technical solution to the dilemma of disruption 


-  It is high time for that community to more fully define  human solution  one that starts with senior leadership and carries through an entire organization 


- Clayton Christensens Theory of Disruptive Innovation first came to public attention 25 years ago 


-  Christensen presciently explained that fast-moving disrupters entering the market with cheap ,  low-quality goods could undermine companies wed to prevailing beliefs about competitive advantage 


-  In the last decade ,  however ,  the profile of disrupters has changed dramatically 


-  The critical difference is that they now enter the market with products and services that are every bit as good as those offered by legacy companies 


-  Their ascendance doesnt undermine Christensens theory 


-  ,  Before we look at how things have evolved ,  lets briefly review why Christensens theory proved so influential and ,  indeed ,  disruptive to existing ideas of competitive advantage 


-  Traditional strategy had been anchored on the notion of generic strategies in which  company could compete at the high end by differentiating ,  at the low end by pursuing cost leadership ,  or focus on serving  specific niche exceptionally well 


-  Christensen illustrated  way for new entrants to cheerfully ignore these basic strategy dynamics 


-  He showed how  new kind of dangerous competitor could wreak havoc by entering at the low end of  market ,  where margins are thin and customers are reluctant to pay for anything they dont need 


-  ,  The new entrant comes in with  product or service thats cheaper and more convenient but that doesnt offer the same level of performance on the dominant criteria that most customers expect from incumbents that have been working on the technology for years 


-  Incumbents choose instead to focus on sustaining innovation  making improvements to the features that have been of most value to their high-end customers 


-  Eventually ,  as these upstarts improve ,  they become pretty good at the old dominant criteria 


-  They also develop such solid innovations at the low end that they bring new customers into the market 


-  Having doubled down on what has always worked ,  the incumbents fail to notice two things 


-  First ,  they miss out on the meaningful value of the low-end innovations developed by newcomers 


-  Their key product has been commoditized ,  supplanted by  new technology that better suits the changed needs of customers 


-  ,   prime example of this process occurred at Intel 


-  The chipmaker enjoyed decades of high margins by selling high-end ,  powerful ,  and fast computer chips for laptops ,  desktop computers ,  and servers that allowed users to get the most out of increasingly power-hungry software 


-  Dominant to the point of near-monopoly ,  Intel dismissed and largely ignored  new set of less powerful ,  albeit less power-hungry ,  chips based on the ARM architecture  ( created by  once-obscure British company )  


-  ,  The smartphone revolution of the late 2000s exposed the fatal flaw in Intels offerings 


-  Intel managers had been focused on making its core microprocessors better at what had always seemed to matter most 


-  So the company missed the potential of mobile device chips ,  which more than made up for their lower margins by finding their way into billions  not millions  of devices 


-  The first is the market entry of  new competitor whose offerings are not good enough to meet the needs of established customers  ( PC owners )  


-  The second is the moment when that entrant creates  market by selling solutions to users who were never customers before ,  like smartphone manufacturers 


-  ,  Christensens theory also highlighted the powerful way that management metrics and incentive structures reinforce this pattern 


-  Financials expressed as ratios ,  accounting-driven depreciation schedules ,  conventional business plans ,  and stock- or time-based rewards to managers all detract from  leaders willingness to pursue uncertain  ( though potentially high-payoff )  innovations 


-  These disrupters target the very core of incumbents existing businesses by using todays broad array of powerful digital technologies to offer products or services that are cheaper ,  more convenient ,  and every bit as good as existing offerings 


-  The combination of just as good with new digital technologies creates  massive inflection point ,  putting more pressure on incumbents than ever 


-  Vendors had to demonstrate large enough demand for  big enough customer segment to earn space on  distributors shelves 


-  This gatekeeping function created several side effects 


-  The second was that the manufacturers had relatively crude information about who the buyers were ,  how the products were stocked and displayed ,  and how they performed relative to competitors sold by the same vendor 


-  For many producers ,  the most important customer was the retailer ,  not the end user 


-  ,  The 2010s saw an explosion of consumer-products companies that dispensed with the gatekeepers to offer their products directly to consumers ,  hence the moniker D2C ,  or direct to consumer 


-  Companies such as Warby Parker  ( founded in 2010 )  ,  Dollar Shave Club  ( 2011 )  ,  Glossier  ( 2010 )  ,  Away  ( 2015 )  ,  Casper  ( 2014 )  ,  and Bonobos  ( 2007 )  are upending categories as varied as eyeglasses ,  mens grooming ,  skin care ,  travel ,  mattresses ,  and clothing 


-  Their value proposition to customers almost always features  comparable product at  lower price 


-  More important ,  it always offers  shopping experience that eliminates many of the frictions and irritants of conventional retail 


-  ,  Dollar Shave Club  ( acquired by Unilever for $1 billion in 2016 )  made  point of criticizing flaws in the existing business model of conventional mens shaving products 


-  Do you like spending $20  month on brand-name razors? he asks his mostly youthful audience 


-  Still ,  its market share has suffered ,  both from the competition with D2C companies like Dollar Shave Club and Harrys and from the trend among men ,  particularly younger ones ,  to wear beards 


-  ,  In  short period of time ,  new competitors have radically changed customer behavior in three significant ways: ,   Consumers are now happy to purchase hard goods like mattresses ,  furniture ,  and even cars online 


-  Making  wrong choice could involve expensive returns ,  lots of wasted time ,  ongoing quality and safety worries ,  and potentially even financial losses 


-  Since making  wrong choice was seen as risky ,  the assumption was that consumers would always want to touch and feel such goods before making  big-commitment purchase 


-  In 2019 ,  the companys revenues topped $500 million ,  taking  chunk out of an industry whose sales were reportedly $27 billion the same year 


-  While the idea started with software  ( the famous software-as-a-service ,  or SaaS ,  model )  ,  you can now utilize clothing ,  furniture ,  cars ,  trucks ,  heavy equipment ,  and even pets on  subscription or limited-trial basis 


-  Why bother to own products when you can get the same benefits only as needed ,  with flexible spending? ,   Excess capacity is  consumer asset 


-  The poster child for this trend is Airbnb ,  which created  marketplace in which ordinary people with underutilized real estate could make money by renting their space to strangers 


-  As of 2019 ,  Americans reportedly spent more money with Airbnb than they did with Hilton ,  accounting for some 20% of consumer money spent on lodging 


-  The model is now extending to other asset classes ,  with startups like Neighbor 


- com ,  which connects homeowners with excess room at home to people who need storage space 


-  ,  Given the success ,  reliability ,  and proven value of these new D2C competitors ,  its hardly surprising that the value of many established brands is in sharp decline 


-  Just as digital technologies allow companies to build businesses almost overnight ,  social media ,  digital channels ,  and online influencers can help new brands build meaningful identities and reputations at warp speed 


-  ,  Christensens original theory of disruption has held up very well in explaining why startups with little in the way of assets or existing brands can capture market share from well-entrenched incumbents 


-  They have little incentive to pursue opportunities with thinner margins than those enjoyed by their core business ,  and their corporate metrics tend to reinforce this status quo 


-  ,  As Christensen also predicted ,  the jobs customers seek to get done in their lives remain remarkably stable5  even though digital technologies have created entirely new ways to get those jobs done 


-  Incumbents can get blindsided by this kind of shift in how  job gets done 


-  In particular ,  they may find that their competitor isnt  traditional one but  company from  different industry altogether that has mastered the new digital technologies 


-  You might also think of e-retailer Alibabas threat to banks with its payment systems ,  Amazons move into groceries and brick-and-mortar shops ,  or Ubers effort to dominate third-party food delivery 


-  ,  Christensens theory also holds for the fact that creating new customers by lowering prices enough to compete with nonconsumption is still  viable opportunity for crafty newcomers 


-  Just as traditional disruptive competitors pulled new buyers into new markets by lowering prices ,  digitally disruptive companies make it radically cheaper ,  easier ,  and faster to become customers 


-  Consider ,  for instance ,  what has happened in the market for hearing aids 


-  And the Eargo comes at  lower price point than traditional hearing aids ,  potentially opening  vast market of people who need hearing assistance but cant afford the traditional model  ( especially when hearing aids are not covered by most medical plans )  


-  In many large organizations ,  incentives are not aligned with the market-creating innovation 


-  One prominent example: Massive share buybacks ,  which handsomely reward executives while draining companies of cash that could be invested in innovation designed to win new customers by transforming exclusive products and services into simpler ,  inexpensive ones 


-  ,  Christensen described disruption as  process that takes some time ,  as new entrants slowly progress from the fringe to the mainstream of an incumbents business 


-  The most significant change since he first laid out his theory is that digital competitors can now move with unprecedented speed 


-  Theres ample available financing  ( as of this writing ,  anyway )  ,  talent aplenty in the gig economy ,  consumers who are comfortable buying just about anything sight unseen ,  and digital technologies to facilitate every operation that might previously have been an obstacle 


-  As Warby Parker ,  Casper ,  and the like have shown ,  disrupters with  competitive value proposition can drive scale at previously unimagined speed 


-  ,   second departure from the theory of disruption has to do with the relationship between the traditional ,  core business and innovative new ones 


-  In the original formulation ,  the core part of the business had fairly predictable  ( if slowly declining )  revenue numbers ,  customers whose needs could be identified ,  and rewards for replicating the existing model at scale 


-  ,  Todays digital disruption is so fierce that core businesses are less reliable than ever ,  and their declines can sometimes be precipitous to the point of endangering the entire enterprise 


-  GEs management realized relatively early on that digital was likely to bring massive change to its businesses 


-  In 2013 ,  it embarked upon  digital transformation with the launch of  platform called Predix ,  which was supposed to harness the internet of things and bring disruptive change to the storied conglomerate 


-  ,  Theres one more important change thats happened since Christensens early work was published 


-  Leaders at German metals distributor Kloeckner ,  for instance ,  determined that if they didnt create  digital platform for doing business ,  some upstart would do it to them ,  and they have been on  steady journey to digitize their industry 


- com ,  and millions more to acquire  string of D2C companies whose offerings are appealing to  younger demographic 


-  Incumbents have read Christensen ,  and the best ones are doing everything they can to avoid the slothful mistakes of the past 


-  The first are those that fall into the classic Christensen trap and ignore the potential change completely 


-  The second are those that spot the disruption and overreact ,  spending vast amounts of money and time on efforts to jump right into whatever the disruptive market seems to hold 


-  What  would observe is that companies such as Kloeckner that begin to make modest investments in potential disruptions gradually create the capabilities to segue into the next phase without  wrenching downfall or excessive shift 


-  Toyota ,  for instance ,  created  mass market for hybrid electric vehicles without abandoning its core internal combustion business ,  and it is one of the few profitable players in the electric vehicle arena 


-  ,  Every traditional company should be aware that the very concept of sustaining innovation is at risk when  digital assault on the core business is as easy ,  fast ,  and affordable as it is today 


-  Business models enabled by digital create potential inflection points for every traditional business 


-  ,  Yet ,  all too often ,  business leaders of incumbent companies spend way too much money on digital transformation efforts that fail to take the new economics and business models of digital disrupters into account 


-  Automating old business models is nothing more than that  it doesnt do  thing to help your company benefit from the disruptive price/performance ratios that digital tools can foster 


-  ,  There is  tremendous amount still to be learned about how to compete in  world moving at the pace of digital 


-  This places  huge premium on being able to learn quickly ,  experiment ,  and then pivot to reflect the insights gleaned 


-  Incumbents need to stop spending money trying to be  better version of their analog selves ,  and instead start approaching digital strategy with an eye toward discovery
