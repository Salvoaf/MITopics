- After corporations committed to dramatically increasing their focus on racial equity in response to the killing of George Floyd in May 2020 ,  the hard work of making the changes needed to live up to those promises began 


-  And if anything threatens to thwart Americas progress toward open dialogue and racial equity ,  it is White peoples unwillingness to engage with the idea that if others are suffering from undeserved disadvantages ,  it is all but certain that they themselves benefit from undeserved advantages 


-  ,  This critical understanding of systemic racism  that all of us ,  whether we want to or not ,  are participants within  system in which our racial membership has implications for important life outcomes  is antithetical to peoples desire or need to see themselves as decent ,  good ,  meritorious individuals 


-  ,  The key to effectively responding to resistance is leveraging that human need to think of ourselves as good ,  because its accompanied by our need to think of our systems as fair and just  and this desire to restore justice is powerful 


-  ,  Just as some readers may feel uncomfortable with the ideas in this article ,  so too will many of your employees 


-  ,  However ,  this very first step is where backlash often begins: Again ,  it can be uncomfortable for White people to think about themselves as White and to recognize that Whiteness offers benefits 


-  These responses are based on the underlying assumption that not being racist means aspiring to  world where all are treated equally and fairly regardless of race 


-  In addition ,  White people who are opposed to racial equity are more likely to endorse colorblindness ,  or the idea that race does not matter and should not be acknowledged 


-  ,  These objections illustrate  confusion that many White people have regarding how systemic racism works 


-  For  group to have advantages does not mean that they do not also ,  as individuals ,  experience personal tragedies ,  suffering ,  and nonracial discrimination or need to engage in hard work 


-   growing category of backlash tactics fall under what we call distortion ,  or strategies wherein White people recognize the existence of racism but distort the nature of racial inequity to protect their own good feelings 


- 10 This allows people to avoid the consideration that racist systems ,  in which they participate ,  may have benefited them 


-  One promising trend we have observed is that more and more organizations are disclosing demographic data regarding recruitment ,  hiring ,  promotion ,  leadership ,  and retention 


-  In the United Kingdom ,  large companies must provide nonfinancial information regarding their activities relating to employee and board diversity 


- 14 Organizations must push themselves to collect and understand better and more meaningful data in order to accurately track their progress 


-  One of the ways in which distancing harms racial equity is by allowing White people to think that efforts toward racial equity need not involve them 


-  But building  shared understanding of inequity as  characteristic of systems in which all people ,  regardless of race ,  are enmeshed entails inviting White people to participate in more active ways than the ubiquitous courageous conversation or listening tour 


-  In an example of  lost opportunity ,  many calls in support of racial equity last summer were clear on their acknowledgment of racial discrimination against minorities ,  but relatively less was said regarding the role that White people can play in reforming the system 


-   notable exception came from one leader ,  who acknowledged in  letter the anguish and trauma that many members of the organizational community were feeling but also urged all stakeholders ,  especially the majority ,  who are White ,  to consider how to actively engage with racism 


-  And ,  in fact ,  research shows that explicitly inviting majority-group members to act on equity increases their support for and engagement with equity initiatives 


-  For this reason ,  we stress the importance of creating spaces where White employees can practice talking about racism 


-   combination of safe learning spaces for White employees and clear guidelines regarding shared expectations for behavior can help to reassure all employees that learning is valued and that violations are treated both fairly and seriously 


-  ,   good deal of the literature aimed at managers makes the business case for diversity ,  no doubt reflecting in part the long-held  but now much-disputed  assumption that business leaders primary allegiance is to shareholders and that any initiative they undertake must contribute to the bottom line 


-  For this reason ,  leaders must not only be explicit about what they will and will not tolerate but also act upon those statements 


- 23 ,  But regardless of where the line is drawn ,  the important point is that there is one: Employees make sense of their organizational culture by observing who and what is rewarded and what is penalized 


-  While  lack of training or knowledge explains some opposition ,  leaders need to treat employees resistance to institutional changes designed to address systemic racism with the same determination with which they treat any opposition to  strategic organizational change: Identify and educate those who need more guidance and can be persuaded ,  and let go those who are unwilling to participate in the vision 


-  ,  Leaders committed to making the changes necessary to advance meaningfully toward racial equity in their organizations must be prepared for some degree of internal opposition ,  most likely from White employees ,  who may variously feel discomfort ,  guilt ,  and/or threats to the existing system and their sense of self 


-  To effectively communicate the urgency of the need for change ,  leaders need to acknowledge the deep harm that systemic racism has wrought on communities and employees of color ,  and connect their efforts at repairing this damage to deeply held social values and corporate purpose 


-  Our hope is that being prepared for this opposition will let organizational leaders preempt the many backlash tactics that have been and will be made against racial equity work 


-  And by successfully countering such backlash ,  leaders and organizations will be better positioned to do the hard work of transformational change needed to dismantle current systems of racism and achieve racial equity
