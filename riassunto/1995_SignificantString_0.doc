-  For example ,  people seem to be unduly influenced by recent or vivid events ,  consistently underestimate the role of chance ,  and are often guilty of wishful thinking 


-  In fact ,  most of us are familiar with paralysis by analysis 


-  ,  Thus managers need to navigate between two deadly extremes: on the one hand ,  ill-conceived and arbitrary decisions made without systematic study and reflection  ( extinction by instinct )  and on the other ,   retreat into abstraction and conservatism that relies obsessively on numbers ,  analyses ,  and reports  ( paralysis by analysis )  


-  ,  individual aptitudes and preferences for analytical or intuitive thinking 


-  However ,  as  show here ,  the fundamental forces that cause an organization to do too much or too little analysis in making  decision are frequently more complex: they relate to the patterns of participation ,  power ,  opinion ,  and leadership surrounding issues 


-  ,  To examine the use of formal analysis ,  it is important to understand the range of motives behind it 


-  In fact ,  the more strategic decision-making power is shared among people who cannot quite trust each other ,  the more formal analysis may become important 


-   do not imply here that formal analysis is  purely political tool and should therefore be categorically and cynically ignored 


-   simply focus on its dual role in decision making 


-  ,   now look more specifically at the five factors that can stimulate organizations to do more or less formal analysis 


-  ,  The first factor influencing the amount of analysis is the breadth of participation 


-  ,  The distribution of power is  second critical factor 


-  Power enables individuals to do what they want without having to convince others 


-  ,  The range of opinions on an issue can also influence the amount of analysis 


-   manager may use formal analysis when uncertain or when already convinced but wanting to influence others 


-  But if all participants think the same way ,  analysis may seem unnecessary  there is no one left to convince 


-  ,  The first three factors are structural in many ways 


-  However ,  two individual factors can also affect the quantity of analysis 


-  For the reasons  described earlier ,  this process can be extremely useful  as long as the leader is ready to both examine the information seriously and ,  at the same time ,  come to  decision or propose  solution 


-  At the opposite extreme ,   more cautious ,  passive ,  or highly consensual leader may encourage many studies and analyses that simply increase the decision makers confusion 


-  ,  The second individual factor is  difference in cognitive style: some people are naturally intuitive ,  while others are more analytical 


-  Thus ,  even when one individual retains exclusive decision-making power ,  the quantity of analysis depends on that individuals cognitive style 


- 10 ,  These factors suggest conditions that may favor excessive or insufficient use of analysis  ( see Figure  )  


-  Thus the risk of paralysis by analysis is highest for issues in which participation is widespread ,  power is dispersed ,  opinions diverge ,  leadership is passive ,  and cognitive styles are analytical 


-  At the opposite extreme ,  the risk of extinction by instinct is highest when participation is limited ,  power is concentrated ,  opinions converge ,  leadership is autocratic ,  and cognitive styles are intuitive 


-  Each situation is characterized by  different configuration of the contextual factors  have described 


-  Some people believe they know what to do and carry out analyses to justify their project ,  but they are unable to force the issue onto the organizational agenda because participants at other levels are either indifferent or opposed 


-  Repetitive analyses lead nowhere because the parties simply do not understand each other 


-  In fact ,  cognitive psychologists studies have shown that formal analysis has little influence on people who are already strongly committed 


-  ,  For example ,  the large teaching hospital in my research needed sophisticated medical equipment 


-  One manager commented: ,  The blockage cascaded down as doubt grew in the minds of managers who had previously approved the project 


-  The structure of interactions surrounding project initiations and approval tends to perpetuate  problem that results less from cognitive style than from  lack of trust among people at different levels 


-   first step could simply be developing greater sensitivity to top managements concerns 


-  For example ,  one organization  studied made considerable progress on  project after the requesting department assigned  new member to prepare the report 


- 12 In other words ,  stronger ,  more credible analysis needs to be combined with informal sources of influence 


- 13 It is not surprising therefore that they sometimes demand more information to make  decision; they need to be certain that they can respond to any question without necessarily understanding the project as well as its original promoters 


-  Requests for more information may cascade up and down the hierarchy ,  accompanied by considerable frustration and disillusionment 


-  In an illustration of the critical role of leadership ,  middle managers weakness does not help either project promoters in formulating their proposals adequately or others who are trying to understand the projects merits 


-  Top management needs to ask whether decisions are made at the appropriate level and whether all the current levels are necessary 


-  Bureaucratic excesses created by the need for communication between numerous levels have often been cited as  reason for the declining competitiveness of such large corporations as IBM and GM in the late 1980s and early 1990s; dismantling of the hierarchy has become  popular management fad 


-  ,  Studies were simply the ammunition in  battle 


-  ,  between different functions or organizational subunits )  and uncertainty ,  ambiguity ,  or hesitation at the top 


-  One interviewee described such  process: ,  Unfortunately ,  because of top managements uncertainty ,  all this analysis is unlikely to clarify the situation and may even enhance divergence 


-  Previously committed people are not easily persuaded ,  and uncommitted people become even more confused by conflicting analyses from opposing factions; the situation becomes  vicious circle 


-   planning analyst initially convinced the CEO that the idea was worth considering ,  but the marketing manager had different views ,  and opinions among the other functional areas were divided 


-  After the planner initiated several analyses ,  the board of directors tentatively decided to proceed and set up  committee of all functional managers 


-  Without the CEOs clear direction ,  the committee worked at cross-purposes ,  with different members pursuing their own objectives and undermining their colleagues analyses 


-  ,  My data and reports of other studies in the literature support the conclusion that top managements uncertainty ,  ambiguity ,  division ,  or passivity contribute significantly to the vicious circle 


- 16 In some organizations ,  the problem seems endemic ,  relating to the dispersion of decision-making power 


- 17 For example ,  Dumaine describes the difficulty of the changes implemented at Becton-Dickinson; marketing and engineering team members were unable to agree on  new product design ,  and the team leader  ( an engineer )  had insufficient authority to impose his views ,  thus slowing the process down considerably 


-  firms are struggling to break down their traditional hierarchies to improve the speed of decision making ,  reports in the business press have suggested that Honda has initiated  transformation in the opposite direction ,  at least partly for the same reason!19 ,  However ,  organizational structure cannot be blamed in all instances of the vicious circle 


-  The structural aspects of the situation  ( wide participation ,  diffuse power ,  divergent opinions ,  and passive leadership style )  naturally encourage them ,  and in this context ,  they may find it practically impossible to avoid an ongoing analysis war even if they know that such wars are usually unconstructive 


-  Since vicious circles tend to feed on themselves  ( with opinions becoming more and more irreconcilable as hostilities escalate )  ,  the earlier the diagnosis ,  the more  satisfactory resolution may be possible diplomatically 


-  ,  Both sides need to consider whether their debate really focuses on facts or on fundamental values and objectives 


-  distinguish between situations of uncertainty  ( in which facts are unclear )  and situations of equivocality  ( in which values and objectives are unclear )  


- 20 They argue that while hard information sources  ( statistics or reports )  can relieve uncertainty ,  softer but richer approaches  ( face-to-face discussions )  are needed to relieve equivocality 


-  All these initiatives may fail ,  however ,  if leaders intentionally or unintentionally encourage the perpetuation of equivocality ,  which brings us to consider the leaders role in resolving vicious circles 


- 22 In my research ,  more directive leadership prevented diverging opinions from degenerating into vicious circles; this did not necessarily mean acceptance of one side or the other ,  but could mean the development of an acceptable compromise so issues did not fester unresolved 


-  In the case of persistent disagreement ,  those with power to decide must decide ,  preferably after listening to others views 


-  In her research on decision making in high velocity computer firms ,  Eisenhardt examined the effects of various kinds of leadership style on decision-making speed  ( and indirectly on organizational performance )  


-  Thus sometimes the leader may need to be replaced 


-  Repeated buck-passing ,  conflict ,  bypassing hierarchy in lower ranks ,  mountains of paper ,  and frequently postponed decisions are signs that such action should be considered 


-  They did an enormous amount of work on it and got into  whole lot of theoretical nonsense 


-  Because the analysis had been delegated to someone other than the decision maker and was so broadly focused ,  the decision makers thinking was often out of phase with the analytical work being done 


-  ,  In theory ,  formal analysis should help to reduce uncertainty by providing information 


-  Strategic planning exercises can easily fall into this trap ,  as one manager commented: ,  Every popular new management approach is susceptible to the vacuum ,  whether strategic planning ,  management-by-objectives ,  total quality management ,  or business process reengineering 


-  As techniques become fashionable ,  avant-garde firms want new groups of staff specialists to implement them 


-  However ,  unless organizations are careful when setting priorities ,  the groups can easily grow out of control ,  creating rituals that justify their size and importance but with limited impact 


- 27 ,  Why do people initiate analytical work in decision vacuums? Sometimes it simply ensures that someone is dealing with  long-term problem that ,  while important ,  is not immediately threatening  ( as in the diversification example )  


-  In other cases ,  analysts themselves initiate the studies ,  at least partly to justify their existence 


-  ,  What can  staff group do if it senses that it has lost top managements attention ,  or that it is making work rather than solving problems? The group needs to review its market and resources; for some ,  the solution may be to seek clients elsewhere ,  either at different levels or even outside the organization  (  


- 28 Other groups may need to reevaluate their skills 


-  And others ,  which may have been overtaken by another units expertise ,  may need to reintegrate in the organization 


-  ,  Ideally ,  however ,  organizations need to create flexible structures and incentives that enourage its staff groups to remain responsive to management needs 


-  First ,  formal analysis is rarely the real cause of paralysis  in fact ,  it is almost the reverse 


-  Paralysis is often generated by  specific pattern of participation ,  power ,  and opinion that stimulates the excessive ,  unproductive use of formal analysis 


-  ,  the Bay of Pigs )  ,  Janis identified groupthink as  major cause of poor decision making 


- 29 As he describes it ,  groupthink occurs when decision makers who work closely together develop  high degree of solidarity that clouds their vision ,  leading them to suppress negative feelings about proposals 


-   have identified three situations in which there was insufficient analysis ,  two of which bear some relationship to Janiss groupthink phenomenon 


-   common element underlies these cases: weak checks and balances in the decision-making process 


-  The power or willingness to challenge choices is absent or temporarily suspended ,  and the organization converges too rapidly on  unique vision ,  leading to extinction by instinct 


-  Second is to avoid thinking he is God 


- 30 Indeed ,  in many organizations ,  it is not easy to contradict or argue too vigorously with the boss 


-  As  respondent in my study suggested ,  even when managers feel they know more than  superior ,  they may suppress doubts because of career considerations ,  Senior managers were convinced 


-  An interviewee commented: With him ,  everyone waited to see what he would say because ,  in any case ,  he would have already considered all sides of the issue 


-  This is less  problem if the leader acts in the organizations interests ,  understands the firm ,  and has strong ethics and cognitive capabilities to make decisions 


-  Colleagues will become yes people ,  and groupthink will take over decision making 


-  It may be particularly difficult for  successful CEO to admit the possibility of error 


- 32 Each individual can evaluate the risks and benefits of each strategy 


-  Some suggest using devils advocates for all major decisions by assigning one individual or subgroup to argue against the dominant view 


-  Others simply do not adequately represent the firms shareholders 


-  Parallel power is  situation in which individuals or groups low in the hierarchy are powerful enough to do what they want ,  even when contrary to organizational objectives 


-  Such power may be based on privileged access to external or internal support that enables individuals to bypass normal decision-making channels 


-  ,  In fact ,  as organizations become more complex ,  they face increasing control and coordination problems 


-  Leaders do not have the time or knowledge to personally manage everything and must therefore trust others not only for executing decisions but also for innovating and developing 


-  And despite many attempts ,  no one has yet invented  perfect system of incentives and rewards to ensure that  managers actions will always be consistent with organizational objectives 


-  For example ,  in the hospital  studied ,  an administrator could not easily question  physicians decision to prescribe treatment for  particular patient  even if the treatment had major political ,  strategic ,  and financial implications 


-  Although the CEO was clear about his goals ,  he lacked the knowledge to define them in detail 


-  He was therefore forced to rely at least partly on different functional managers ,  some of whom were unhappy about the change 


-  ,  These difficulties partly underlie several well-known failures of unrestrained ,  unrelated diversification 


-  ,  Privileged access to decision influences is one factor underlying parallel power 


-  Managers naturally want to obtain information from many possible sources ,  but when access is unequal and political games systematically begin to control decisions ,  objectives are subverted ,  decisions are arbitrary ,  and formal decision-making procedures become empty rituals 


-  Thus the best way to prevent access abuse is for top managers to make their own decision-making procedures transparent 


-  However ,  in large ,  complex firms ,  this deep intuitive understanding is often beyond many managers capabilities 


-  Their visceral response is to demand more formal analysis for direction and control as  substitute for informal tacit knowledge 


-  Moreover ,  control by analysis can be counterproductive if pushed too far ,  creating  climate of escalating distrust as lower-level managers increase the subtlety of control avoidance in parallel with growing demands for information from above 


-  ,  In fact ,  we are back full circle to the dialogue of the deaf 


-  ,  Next is the third element behind parallel power: the misalignment of personal and organizational objectives 


-  ,  When everyone in power instinctively shares the same opinion on an issue ,  the wise manager should be wary 


-  Unanimity is unlikely to lead to an objective evaluation of options ,  and normal checks and balances may be short-circuited 


-  ,   uniformity in which members share values and beliefs and that excludes deviation from the decision-making process 


- 42 ,  Natural unanimity may also occur when  corporate head office or  government agency invests in an area for strategic reasons but then fails to apply normal control criteria to the specifics of resource use 


-  However ,  the urgency to produce something  anything  to satisfy an outside requirement was certainly not conducive to thoroughly analyzed proposals 


-  ,  As for staff analysts ,  the professional literature for planners and analysts stresses the importance of developing mutual understanding and harmonious relationships with line management 


-  Based on my research ,  however ,   suggest that the need for good relationships has been greatly overemphasized 


-  One remarked ,  Pete was seen as  far-out guy ,  and Fred wanted to see what  far-out guy would make of it 


-  He commented: ,  This approach also provides for second opinions without an elaborate staff bureaucracy and forces discussion among functional groups 


-  Pascale points out that contention can be constructive if harnessed at the right time to ensure variety in thinking 


- 44 ,  In the previous sections ,   have looked at several decision-making pathologies associated with either excessive or insufficient formal analysis and examined how the problems can be corrected or avoided 


-  ,  The key element of any strategy for avoiding extinction by instinct is to instill checks and balances into the system so that people must think through their ideas 


-  Informally ,  managers must learn to tolerate dissidence and encourage their colleagues to express doubts about proposals 


-  In addition ,  the legitimacy and integrity of the decision-making system needs to be protected 


-  Propositions from various parts of the organization need to be treated transparently ,  equitably ,  and consistently to avoid arbitrary ,  ultimately indefensible decisions based on privileged access rather than mature reflection 


-  Efficient arbitration is needed to produce rapid ,  rational decisions 


-  In addition ,  while listening to dissident opinions ,  leaders must be prepared to make up the organizations mind 


-  ,  Although formal analysis is  purely technical activity ,  the factors that stimulate its use  ( or nonuse )  are very often political or interpersonal 


-  Therefore  argue that if we want to influence the way organizations reason ,  we must look at the context in which people make decisions 


-  To stimulate both rationality and efficiency in decision making ,  we need to design organizations and approaches that combine constructive checks and balances with effective ways to arbitrate 


-  In fact ,  almost all the solutions  propose contain the seeds of their own defeat: if pushed too far ,  they will send the organization from one pathological situation to its opposite  ( see Table  )
