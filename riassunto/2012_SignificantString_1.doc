-  Working with external partners allows them to access different pools of knowledge and save R&D costs 


-  Rather than merely licensing inventions ,  another often-underappreciated opportunity for companies is to get help from universities during the whole life cycle of their innovation projects 


-  ,  However ,  working with universities poses considerable challenges for managers 


-  First ,  the open nature of academic science is at times in conflict with companies need to protect technologies they use 


-  As Claus Otto ,  program manager at Royal Dutch Shell PLC ,  says ,  It is important to ask yourself: What can these university centers do better or different than we can? Shell ,  for example ,  invests in university partnerships in areas where it does not yet make business sense for the company to build extensive technology capability 


-  ,  To leverage value from universities ,  we argue that business executives need to consider two key dimensions 


-  Openness facilitates rapid publishing ,  which constitutes the lifeblood of public science7 and has the advantage of reducing transaction costs related to intellectual property 


-  The proposals are reviewed by HP and selected on the basis of their alignment with HPs interests and needs 


-  To manage intellectual property for these projects ,  HP Labs uses  standardized collaborative research agreement that entitles academics to publish their results ,  but it also provides HP with the nonexclusive right to use the findings 


-  ,  These types of programs allow companies to test  professors aptitude to work on industry-related projects and his or her ability to manage projects in  timely manner 


-  To this purpose ,  companies should choose projects that are relatively low risk and that do not result in major opportunity costs or other damage if they fail 


-  ,  How should companies undertake such short-term open explorations? First ,  it is important for companies to explain the problems in  way that will help academics work toward useful solutions 


-  ,  What do companies gain from sponsoring such open innovation projects? For companies ,  it can make sense to fund open ,  long-term research even though they may forfeit the ability to appropriate the results in  legal sense 


-  One situation in which this makes sense is when leading industry players become aware that collective action is needed to address fundamental challenges experienced by the entire industry 


-  In this situation ,  Malcolm Skingle ,  director of academic liaison at GlaxoSmithKline ,  believes it may make sense to invest collectively in building an industry commons to instigate  game change in the speed of new knowledge creation 


-  His counterparts at Merck ,  Novartis and Pfizer agree and have invested together in open science initiatives even though they are otherwise fierce competitors 


-  Such follow-on knowledge creation can be  powerful mechanism for shaping open source platforms ,  attracting others to certain norms and standards and thereby seeding  new innovation ecosystem 


-  ,  Open ,  long-term grand challenges need to be carefully governed 


-  ,  Setting the research objectives for open ,  long-term projects requires  careful balancing of the sponsors need for practical relevance and academics orientation toward the scientific commons 


-  Therefore ,  company sponsors not only need to be present at  strategic level but also need to be involved on  technical level 


-  Christopher Ramming ,  director of Intel Labs university collaboration office ,  says ,  With highly active Intel personnel we can present industry context ,  understand the strengths and weaknesses of  new idea ,  and help translate the research outcomes into corporate impact 


-  ,  Even when an initiative is open ,  companies need to be careful that proprietary information is not released into the public domain 


-  To maximize sponsor influence ,  and minimize knowledge leakage ,  the Structural Genomics Consortium devised  mechanism whereby sponsors requirements were kept confidential ,  both within the organization and from the outside world 


-  The SGC management was  trusted broker that carefully managed information flows and prevented leakage 


-  Company R&D engineers were at  loss to explain these failures and decided to turn to their university partners for help 


-  The university researchers took on the challenge and were able to find the underlying reason within six weeks 


-  ,  Managers need to overcome two concerns to create successful short-term ,  protected collaborations with universities 


-  They provide little or no opportunity for publication and force them to shift their work from their research efforts toward short-term goals 


-  From their point of view ,  the opportunity cost can be high 


-  In addition ,  these projects are usually highly confidential ,  and the business needs to protect the problem and the solution 


-   former global head of university partnerships at  major defense company explained that traditionally it was difficult to recruit academics for short-term contracts 


-  Relationships forged on the anvil of  pressing problem may generate the trust to enable richer and deeper future research collaborations 


-  Nondisclosure agreements ,  embedded in  trusted relationship ,  are usually sufficient to maintain confidentiality 


-  ,  Although short-term ,  protected collaboration can be highly attractive and remain  common form of collaboration ,  such projects rely on businesses to have  rich Rolodex of academic contacts whom they trust and can work with ,  and whose research areas are closely matched to the businesss problems 


-  Businesses may want to put selected academics on consulting retainers so that they are well positioned to attend to problems as they emerge rather than arriving after the problem has already taken hold 


- 19 ,  Despite this ,  contract research agreements with universities can be complicated to set up 


-  One approach that can help avoid protracted negotiations is to invest in framework agreements with key university partners 


-  These agreements offer  set of model contracts and  rapid-fire system for launching contract research agreements 


-  An example of this approach can be seen in Procter  Gambles collaborative agreements with the University System of Ohio in the United States ,  Durham University in the United Kingdom ,  and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel 


-  To address  related challenge ,  Intel has recently been working with  nonprofit entity called University-Industry Research Corp 


-  ,  Long-term ,  deep and protected collaborations with universities enable companies to not only create new knowledge ,  but also to gain competitive advantage from the outputs of these research efforts 


-  Such agreements also ensure  strong alignment between the companys R&D strategy and research ,  helping to overcome the tendency toward agenda drift associated with more open grand challenges 


-  Through the intellectual property provisions in such relationships ,  companies can also mitigate the danger of knowledge leakage by their university partners 


-   typical mechanism for deep explorations is to set up  medium-term agreement  ( often more than three years )  with an academic partner to establish  new center or invest in an existing center 


-  Within the agreement ,  it is important to specify the relationship between the company and research organizations and how payments may be tied to specific milestones or achievements 


-  For example ,  Pfizers 2006 agreement with The Scripps Research Institute22 provided $100 million of research funding for five years 


-  As part of the agreement ,  Pfizer has to decide within one or two months whether to exercise its licensing option on  discovery 


-  Pfizer agreed to ensure that Scripps will receive  share of future royalties arising from the licensed discoveries 


-  Fundamentally ,  agreements like deep explorations create incentive problems for academics ,  since many of them seek to publish and diffuse their work rather than produce innovations that will be exclusively licensed by  corporate sponsor 


- 25 Second ,  any decision to patent  discovery or restrict publications due to confidential information in  deep exploration partnership requires fast approval processes so that academics are not left waiting to know whether they may publish or not 


-  Businesses must agree with their academic partners on  streamlined system for managing disclosures ,  whereby academics are allowed to publish important but noncritical findings around an invention 


-  Academic scientists also need access to protected inventions to develop follow-on applications and discoveries 


-  It is also possible to create incentives within the collaboration that more directly align with academic motivations 


- 26 While these researchers do not need to be given incentives to work on commercially oriented projects ,  companies need to ensure that contracts are clear regarding who will have what rights to any arising intellectual property ,  how royalties from licenses are to be distributed and how the project relates to the scholars other commercial activities and ventures 


-  Another factor to consider: Differences across countries in university rules can ,  in some cases ,  be substantial 


-  By balancing considerations such as time horizon and degree of openness ,  managers can turn universities into valuable partners in both the short and long run  provided the relationships are designed in advance to meet both organizations goals
