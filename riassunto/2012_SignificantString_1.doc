- One hallmark of  successful company is that it stands out from the crowd 


-  Perhaps its approach to customer service is groundbreaking ,  the opportunities it offers its employees more exciting or its products just cooler than the competitors 


-  ,  What enables some companies to be consistently and resolutely different? Business writers have pointed to such attributes as visionary leadership ,   unique corporate culture and  distinctive set of core competencies 


-  Although there is little doubt that such elements can sometimes play  key role ,  we argue that ,  in the end ,   companys beliefs  or what we refer to as its uncommon sense  are often the most critical source of differentiation 


-  Peter Druckers theory of the business focuses on the underlying beliefs held by the organizations leaders about what the business does 


-  Yet while many recognize that beliefs form the platform for actions and capabilities ,  its less clear how managers can apply this insight 


-  Research in this area has tended to focus ,  for example ,  on how competing businesses converge on the same set of beliefs or industry recipes over time ,  or how  companys dominant logic locks it into  narrow way of thinking about its business opportunities 


-  Our approach ,  by contrast ,  is to show how managers can generate  distinctive belief system  their uncommon sense  and translate it into action 


-  ,  Good strategies start from  distinctive point of view: for example ,  an insight into evolving customer needs or about how the world is changing 


-  However ,  few companies manage to develop original strategies by formulating hypotheses and then testing them out in  competitive setting 


-  Instead ,  many deploy frameworks and models from the strategists toolbox  industry analysis ,  market segmentation ,  benchmarking and outsourcing 


-  By jumping straight to generic game plans  ( such as cost leadership ,  total quality or product innovation )  ,  companies short-circuit the real work of strategy and miss out on finding new insights into the preferences or behaviors of current or potential customers 


-  ,  In its purest form ,   distinctive belief system manifests itself in  blue ocean strategy   market position in which the business has no obvious competitors 


-  If the bottom of the food chain in strategy is competing for share of  commodity market  ( where price is the only real differentiator )  ,  then the top of the food chain is inventing  market where the uniqueness of ones offering is protected by seemingly insurmountable barriers to competition 


-  ,  Sam Walton famously credited Wal-Marts success to  single heretical assumption: that there was an unrecognized opportunity in placing good-size discount stores into little one-horse towns that everybody else was ignoring 


-  Other examples of blue-ocean thinking can be found in the strategic innovations of Cirque de Soleil ,  which blended the artistry of  live circus with the refinement of  Broadway production ,  and Southwest Airlines ,  which developed  fresh new model for low-cost ,  no-frills air travel 


-  We have conducted research on corporate distinctiveness for five years ,  and in most cases distinctiveness manifests itself in smaller ways 


-  )  For example ,  HCL Technologies ,  an IT services company ,  based in Noida ,  India ,  has found that by putting employees first ,  customers second it can generate greater value in its customer relationships than its competitors 


-  Such beliefs may not result in the creation of entirely new lines of business ,  but they have  pervasive influence on the way employees behave 


-  It goes beyond the more conventional notions of market positioning and product differentiation because it works at the level of beliefs rather than just actions or capabilities 


-  As  result ,  it is woven into the fabric of the organization and its vision of itself 


-  In business ,  it implies that success flows to organizations that authentically operate idiosyncratic ,  self-discovered and coherent belief systems 


-  Beliefs can take many forms ,  but the three most important ones are: ,  Within  given industry ,  all companies  ( even the most idiosyncratic ones )  share many of the same beliefs and assumptions 


-  ,  Not all of  companys beliefs are actually true 


-  To be wealth-creating ,  the truth content of  companys belief system must be greater than that of its competitors 


-  In our words ,  winning strategies exhibit uncommon sense: sense because they are true ,  and uncommon because they are proprietary to the winning company 


-  The winner knows something that competitors do not know 


-  Using the same logic ,  common sense is the set of true beliefs that are shared by competitors; common nonsense is the set of false beliefs shared by competitors; and uncommon nonsense is the set of distinctive beliefs held by one company that are actually not true  ( See Types of Beliefs in an Industry 


-  Whats more ,  propositions that may once have been true almost always become less true or even false over time 


-  Market tastes and preferences change 


-  Technology makes new things possible 


-  ,  Managing  business is  journey of discovery ,  uncovering falsehoods and formulating new hypotheses 


-  Built on Ingvar Kamprads belief that he could create  better everyday life for the many people by providing affordable ,  good-quality furniture ,  the company grew internationally in the late 1960s and early 1970s by replicating what worked in Sweden 


-  However ,  Kamprad and his colleagues didnt fully understand which parts of their offering people actually cared about: Was it the expansive and customer-friendly showrooms? Was it the low prices and the products requiring relatively easy assembly? Was it the quirky Swedish product names and blue-and-yellow branding? Ikeas repeated success in new markets it entered made executives wary of changing any part of the original formula 


-  It was only when the company experienced problems in Japan and the United States that executives undertook to sort out the truths and falsehoods and create  more flexible business approach 


-  ,  Our approach provides an analytical tool that allows strategy making to become more systematic and coherent 


-  However ,  there are ways of generating better ideas for enhancing your distinctiveness ,  and there are also ways of testing out those ideas in an organized fashion 


-  ,  Discovering The goal of discovering is to create new value for the company by expanding its uncommon sense  adding  dimension to the companys offering that competitors dont have 


-  Metro International is one such example 


-  In 1995 ,  it launched the first free mass-market newspaper in Stockholm 


-  Despite widespread skepticism from competitors and industry observers ,  the newspaper managed to generate enough advertising revenue to become profitable 


-  ,  Like Metro ,  Petrofac ,   fast-growing oil services company that operates extensively in the Middle East ,  has built its success by following  distinctive set of beliefs within its industry 


-  Ayman Asfari ,  the companys CEO and main shareholder ,  saw an opportunity to move away from the traditional contracting model of the energy industry toward one in which the service provider became an equity partner and assumed some of the overall performance risk 


-  The London-based company achieved  major milestone in 2000 by winning  $1 billion development in southern Algeria with two much larger partners 


-  Key to winning the contract was Petrofacs offer to be  10% equity partner in the development   move that competitors had not considered 


-  As  partner ,  Petrofac was able to complete the project ahead of schedule and within budget 


-  ,  Discarding Discarding involves challenging the companys sacred cows when examination exposes them as falsehoods; this will reduce the amount of nonsense  common or uncommon  the company believes 


-   famous example is Apples decision in the 1990s to relax its vertically integrated business model and begin selling personal computers compatible with the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessors 


-  Although the merits of that decision are still being debated ,  it represented  clear recognition by Apple management that the old strategy was failing and that the company needed to take drastic steps to reverse its decline 


-  ,  On  more micro-level ,  Ikea has adapted its business model to adjust to changing market conditions 


-  During the dotcom boom ,  the company refused to consider online selling for fear that its unique value proposition would be undermined 


-  But gradually it acquiesced ,  and it now does  significant share of its business over the web 


-  The company also experienced problems selling its standardized product lines in certain markets 


-  This ,  too ,  has changed with the introduction of larger beds and kitchen cabinets in the  


-  market 


-  Ikea stores must conform to company-wide values and operating principles ,  but today there is considerable freedom within these guidelines 


-  ,  Marooning As  company challenges the orthodox thinking of its industry and replaces it with  fresh ,  market-tested approach ,  it leaves competitors isolated ,  or marooned ,  with an outdated business model 


-  ,  Consider the case of Thomson Reuters governance ,  risk and compliance business ,  which sells information services to corporate compliance officers ,  regulators and lawyers 


-  The standard approach to risk management is to encourage clients to move slowly 


-  However ,  Thomson Reuters takes  different approach 


-  We believe risk management can be agile: You can move quickly and still manage your risks ,  says David Craig ,  president of the governance ,  risk and compliance unit 


-  So we have built our services to help clients accelerate the development of their business ,  rather than slow it down 


-  ,  Another example: In the hotel industry ,  the standard checkout time for guests is noon ,  and check-in is typically after   


-  Located at airports and in major city centers ,  Yotel offers quiet ,  no-frills rooms at affordable prices ,  no matter what time of day or night 


-  But it differs in an important way: The new belief boldly repudiates an existing orthodoxy ,  rather than simply being  new way of thinking 


-  This makes it harder for competitors to reposition their offering 


-  ,  Neutralizing Companies that embrace the uncommon sense of  competitor and incorporate it into their own belief system can reinforce their own market position and neutralize their competitors uncommon sense 


-   good example of this has occurred in recent years in online media 


-  One of the important ways the Internet revolutionized the media industry was that it allowed readers to comment on articles in real time 


-  When web-only media like the Huffington Post offered this option ,  traditional newspapers faced  dilemma: readers wanted to comment ,  but many writers were strongly resistant to the idea 


-  For example ,  in the United Kingdom ,  the Guardian was the first established publication to allow readers to post comments on its online articles 


-  However ,  the introduction of online comment ultimately brought little long-term benefit because nearly everyone else very quickly began to offer it as well 


-  Indeed ,  it has become part of the common sense of the industry 


-  Until the early 1990s ,  responsibility for engine management and maintenance belonged to the airlines that owned the aircraft or to  third-party provider; the assumption was that the financial and operational risks were best carried by the operator 


-  However ,  by acquiring British Airways repair and overhaul facility in South Wales in 1991 ,  GE Aviation challenged this belief 


-  However ,  Rolls-Royce ,  for one ,  quickly recognized the threat and sought to neutralize it by integrating the sale of new engines and the aftermarket 


-  Through an offering called TotalCare ,  it introduced  long-term service agreement that transferred the technical and financial risk of engine fleet management from the airline to Rolls-Royce 


-  Airlines pay  fixed dollar amount per flying hour ,  thereby aligning the incentives of both the operator and the OEM in the pursuit of maximum reliability and use 


-  ,  By neutralizing its key competitors move and improving on it ,  Rolls-Royce has benefited greatly 


-  Since 2000 ,  Rolls-Royce has seen the TotalCare segment of its installed user base grow from 3% to over 65% in 2010 ,  and almost all its new engine orders include the service agreement as  fundamental element of the deal 


-  Instead ,  it is about carefully figuring out which parts of  rivals beliefs to pick up on ,  and which parts to ignore 


-  ,  So how do companies put ideas they develop through our process into action? Based on our experience ,  successful companies dont just talk about their novel beliefs or make risky bets on unproven ideas 


-  They turn one of their novel beliefs into an operational hypothesis and then test it in as low-risk  way as possible 


-  The feedback they get from the market informs their further testing ,  ultimately shaping the companys decision to make  tangible change 


-  ,  The real world ,  of course ,  doesnt allow businesspeople to test ideas as thoroughly as research scientists or academics can 


-  The case of  growing provider of business-to-business customer service solutions called 24/7 Customer ,  based in Campbell ,  California ,  provides an excellent example of how the process can work 


-  The company was founded in 2000 on the belief that customer expectations for customer service would change dramatically with the Internet and that the customer experience should be intuitive 


-  For example ,  when  customer visits an airline website ,  24/7 Customers software monitors the clicks; if it seems that the person needs help ,   pop-up window offers suggestions and  number to call 


-  For mobile phone service providers ,  24/7 Customer offers  feature where individuals can preview their first months phone bill online 


-  More than 80% of mobile phone customers call when they receive their first bill because they are surprised at how large it is ,  explains founder and CEO  


-  This service anticipates their concerns ,  and explains the tariff in detail before it becomes  problem 


-  The result ,  he says ,  is increased customer loyalty and retention 


-  It has its own innovation lab ,  staffed with 100 computer scientists ,  data engineers and consumer behavior specialists dedicated to proposing new service ideas and test sites 


-  If  new idea works out ,  it is then packaged as an offering for the client ,  and eventually it can be made available more widely 


-  Although Kannan concedes that not every experiment leads directly to  useful idea ,  even the ones that dont pan out can result in insights into what customers may be looking for 


-  ,  Finding  distinctive place in  competitive marketplace can be extremely challenging 


-  Studying and working with dozens of companies across  range of industries ,  we have found that it frequently requires willingness on the part of top management to examine and re-examine the prevailing industry norms  and from  variety of perspectives 


-  For example ,  Paul Marsden and Adrian Kinnersley ,  founders of Twenty ,   rapidly growing recruitment consultancy based in London ,  had seen many established recruitment firms rise and fall over the years 


-  One thing they knew was how little loyalty most recruitment professionals had for the agencies they worked for 


-  So ,  as Kinnersley recalls ,  the issues they decided to focus on when contemplating starting  new firm involved thinking about the business from the employees perspective: What did they want the business to feel like for people who worked there? Given what they had seen elsewhere ,  what should its underlying values be? One thing they decided was that the new firm should go against the grain of the recruitment industry and be quirky 


-  For example ,  most recruitment firms were secretive about what individuals earned ,  so Twenty decided that one of its core values was to be crystal clear with its employees: Detailed information about the compensation and bonus system was provided online ,  and the firms financial results were updated monthly ,  for all employees to see 


-  ,  Companies such as 24/7 Customer and Twenty were founded on the premise of doing things differently from other players in their industries 


-  Entrepreneurs are by nature unorthodox thinkers ,  so it is not surprising that many examples of uncommon sense come from this subset of companies 


-  Still ,  there is plenty of scope for established companies to use this framework 


-  In particular ,  the techniques for neutralizing and marooning competitors ,  as well as discarding beliefs that are no longer true ,  have been adopted by major companies including Rolls-Royce and Thomson Reuters 


-  Yes ,  it is challenging to get executives thinking in this unorthodox and experimental way ,  but the potential rewards are enormous 


-  However ,  we think there are advantages to beginning at  different point  with  companys underlying beliefs and with the explicit recognition that some of those beliefs are smart and others arent 


-  Many companies exhibit common sense in the way they pursue market opportunities ,  but only  few have the uncommon sense on which long-lasting success is built
