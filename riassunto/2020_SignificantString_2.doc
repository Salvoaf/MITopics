- Clayton Christensens Theory of Disruptive Innovation first came to public attention 25 years ago 


-  Christensen presciently explained that fast-moving disrupters entering the market with cheap ,  low-quality goods could undermine companies wed to prevailing beliefs about competitive advantage 


-  In the last decade ,  however ,  the profile of disrupters has changed dramatically 


-  The critical difference is that they now enter the market with products and services that are every bit as good as those offered by legacy companies 


-  Their ascendance doesnt undermine Christensens theory 


-  ,  Before we look at how things have evolved ,  lets briefly review why Christensens theory proved so influential and ,  indeed ,  disruptive to existing ideas of competitive advantage 


-  Traditional strategy had been anchored on the notion of generic strategies in which  company could compete at the high end by differentiating ,  at the low end by pursuing cost leadership ,  or focus on serving  specific niche exceptionally well 


-  Christensen illustrated  way for new entrants to cheerfully ignore these basic strategy dynamics 


-  He showed how  new kind of dangerous competitor could wreak havoc by entering at the low end of  market ,  where margins are thin and customers are reluctant to pay for anything they dont need 


-  ,  The new entrant comes in with  product or service thats cheaper and more convenient but that doesnt offer the same level of performance on the dominant criteria that most customers expect from incumbents that have been working on the technology for years 


-  Incumbents choose instead to focus on sustaining innovation  making improvements to the features that have been of most value to their high-end customers 


-  Eventually ,  as these upstarts improve ,  they become pretty good at the old dominant criteria 


-  They also develop such solid innovations at the low end that they bring new customers into the market 


-  Having doubled down on what has always worked ,  the incumbents fail to notice two things 


-  First ,  they miss out on the meaningful value of the low-end innovations developed by newcomers 


-  Their key product has been commoditized ,  supplanted by  new technology that better suits the changed needs of customers 


-  ,   prime example of this process occurred at Intel 


-  The chipmaker enjoyed decades of high margins by selling high-end ,  powerful ,  and fast computer chips for laptops ,  desktop computers ,  and servers that allowed users to get the most out of increasingly power-hungry software 


-  Dominant to the point of near-monopoly ,  Intel dismissed and largely ignored  new set of less powerful ,  albeit less power-hungry ,  chips based on the ARM architecture  ( created by  once-obscure British company )  


-  ,  The smartphone revolution of the late 2000s exposed the fatal flaw in Intels offerings 


-  Intel managers had been focused on making its core microprocessors better at what had always seemed to matter most 


-  So the company missed the potential of mobile device chips ,  which more than made up for their lower margins by finding their way into billions  not millions  of devices 


-  The first is the market entry of  new competitor whose offerings are not good enough to meet the needs of established customers  ( PC owners )  


-  The second is the moment when that entrant creates  market by selling solutions to users who were never customers before ,  like smartphone manufacturers 


-  ,  Christensens theory also highlighted the powerful way that management metrics and incentive structures reinforce this pattern 


-  Financials expressed as ratios ,  accounting-driven depreciation schedules ,  conventional business plans ,  and stock- or time-based rewards to managers all detract from  leaders willingness to pursue uncertain  ( though potentially high-payoff )  innovations 


-  These disrupters target the very core of incumbents existing businesses by using todays broad array of powerful digital technologies to offer products or services that are cheaper ,  more convenient ,  and every bit as good as existing offerings 


-  The combination of just as good with new digital technologies creates  massive inflection point ,  putting more pressure on incumbents than ever 


-  Vendors had to demonstrate large enough demand for  big enough customer segment to earn space on  distributors shelves 


-  This gatekeeping function created several side effects 


-  The second was that the manufacturers had relatively crude information about who the buyers were ,  how the products were stocked and displayed ,  and how they performed relative to competitors sold by the same vendor 


-  For many producers ,  the most important customer was the retailer ,  not the end user 


-  ,  The 2010s saw an explosion of consumer-products companies that dispensed with the gatekeepers to offer their products directly to consumers ,  hence the moniker D2C ,  or direct to consumer 


-  Companies such as Warby Parker  ( founded in 2010 )  ,  Dollar Shave Club  ( 2011 )  ,  Glossier  ( 2010 )  ,  Away  ( 2015 )  ,  Casper  ( 2014 )  ,  and Bonobos  ( 2007 )  are upending categories as varied as eyeglasses ,  mens grooming ,  skin care ,  travel ,  mattresses ,  and clothing 


-  Their value proposition to customers almost always features  comparable product at  lower price 


-  More important ,  it always offers  shopping experience that eliminates many of the frictions and irritants of conventional retail 


-  ,  Dollar Shave Club  ( acquired by Unilever for $1 billion in 2016 )  made  point of criticizing flaws in the existing business model of conventional mens shaving products 


-  Do you like spending $20  month on brand-name razors? he asks his mostly youthful audience 


-  Still ,  its market share has suffered ,  both from the competition with D2C companies like Dollar Shave Club and Harrys and from the trend among men ,  particularly younger ones ,  to wear beards 


-  ,  In  short period of time ,  new competitors have radically changed customer behavior in three significant ways: ,   Consumers are now happy to purchase hard goods like mattresses ,  furniture ,  and even cars online 


-  Making  wrong choice could involve expensive returns ,  lots of wasted time ,  ongoing quality and safety worries ,  and potentially even financial losses 


-  Since making  wrong choice was seen as risky ,  the assumption was that consumers would always want to touch and feel such goods before making  big-commitment purchase 


-  In 2019 ,  the companys revenues topped $500 million ,  taking  chunk out of an industry whose sales were reportedly $27 billion the same year 


-  While the idea started with software  ( the famous software-as-a-service ,  or SaaS ,  model )  ,  you can now utilize clothing ,  furniture ,  cars ,  trucks ,  heavy equipment ,  and even pets on  subscription or limited-trial basis 


-  Why bother to own products when you can get the same benefits only as needed ,  with flexible spending? ,   Excess capacity is  consumer asset 


-  The poster child for this trend is Airbnb ,  which created  marketplace in which ordinary people with underutilized real estate could make money by renting their space to strangers 


-  As of 2019 ,  Americans reportedly spent more money with Airbnb than they did with Hilton ,  accounting for some 20% of consumer money spent on lodging 


-  The model is now extending to other asset classes ,  with startups like Neighbor 


- com ,  which connects homeowners with excess room at home to people who need storage space 


-  ,  Given the success ,  reliability ,  and proven value of these new D2C competitors ,  its hardly surprising that the value of many established brands is in sharp decline 


-  Just as digital technologies allow companies to build businesses almost overnight ,  social media ,  digital channels ,  and online influencers can help new brands build meaningful identities and reputations at warp speed 


-  ,  Christensens original theory of disruption has held up very well in explaining why startups with little in the way of assets or existing brands can capture market share from well-entrenched incumbents 


-  They have little incentive to pursue opportunities with thinner margins than those enjoyed by their core business ,  and their corporate metrics tend to reinforce this status quo 


-  ,  As Christensen also predicted ,  the jobs customers seek to get done in their lives remain remarkably stable5  even though digital technologies have created entirely new ways to get those jobs done 


-  Incumbents can get blindsided by this kind of shift in how  job gets done 


-  In particular ,  they may find that their competitor isnt  traditional one but  company from  different industry altogether that has mastered the new digital technologies 


-  You might also think of e-retailer Alibabas threat to banks with its payment systems ,  Amazons move into groceries and brick-and-mortar shops ,  or Ubers effort to dominate third-party food delivery 


-  ,  Christensens theory also holds for the fact that creating new customers by lowering prices enough to compete with nonconsumption is still  viable opportunity for crafty newcomers 


-  Just as traditional disruptive competitors pulled new buyers into new markets by lowering prices ,  digitally disruptive companies make it radically cheaper ,  easier ,  and faster to become customers 


-  Consider ,  for instance ,  what has happened in the market for hearing aids 


-  And the Eargo comes at  lower price point than traditional hearing aids ,  potentially opening  vast market of people who need hearing assistance but cant afford the traditional model  ( especially when hearing aids are not covered by most medical plans )  


-  In many large organizations ,  incentives are not aligned with the market-creating innovation 


-  One prominent example: Massive share buybacks ,  which handsomely reward executives while draining companies of cash that could be invested in innovation designed to win new customers by transforming exclusive products and services into simpler ,  inexpensive ones 


-  ,  Christensen described disruption as  process that takes some time ,  as new entrants slowly progress from the fringe to the mainstream of an incumbents business 


-  The most significant change since he first laid out his theory is that digital competitors can now move with unprecedented speed 


-  Theres ample available financing  ( as of this writing ,  anyway )  ,  talent aplenty in the gig economy ,  consumers who are comfortable buying just about anything sight unseen ,  and digital technologies to facilitate every operation that might previously have been an obstacle 


-  As Warby Parker ,  Casper ,  and the like have shown ,  disrupters with  competitive value proposition can drive scale at previously unimagined speed 


-  ,   second departure from the theory of disruption has to do with the relationship between the traditional ,  core business and innovative new ones 


-  In the original formulation ,  the core part of the business had fairly predictable  ( if slowly declining )  revenue numbers ,  customers whose needs could be identified ,  and rewards for replicating the existing model at scale 


-  ,  Todays digital disruption is so fierce that core businesses are less reliable than ever ,  and their declines can sometimes be precipitous to the point of endangering the entire enterprise 


-  GEs management realized relatively early on that digital was likely to bring massive change to its businesses 


-  In 2013 ,  it embarked upon  digital transformation with the launch of  platform called Predix ,  which was supposed to harness the internet of things and bring disruptive change to the storied conglomerate 


-  ,  Theres one more important change thats happened since Christensens early work was published 


-  Leaders at German metals distributor Kloeckner ,  for instance ,  determined that if they didnt create  digital platform for doing business ,  some upstart would do it to them ,  and they have been on  steady journey to digitize their industry 


- com ,  and millions more to acquire  string of D2C companies whose offerings are appealing to  younger demographic 


-  Incumbents have read Christensen ,  and the best ones are doing everything they can to avoid the slothful mistakes of the past 


-  The first are those that fall into the classic Christensen trap and ignore the potential change completely 


-  The second are those that spot the disruption and overreact ,  spending vast amounts of money and time on efforts to jump right into whatever the disruptive market seems to hold 


-  What  would observe is that companies such as Kloeckner that begin to make modest investments in potential disruptions gradually create the capabilities to segue into the next phase without  wrenching downfall or excessive shift 


-  Toyota ,  for instance ,  created  mass market for hybrid electric vehicles without abandoning its core internal combustion business ,  and it is one of the few profitable players in the electric vehicle arena 


-  ,  Every traditional company should be aware that the very concept of sustaining innovation is at risk when  digital assault on the core business is as easy ,  fast ,  and affordable as it is today 


-  Business models enabled by digital create potential inflection points for every traditional business 


-  ,  Yet ,  all too often ,  business leaders of incumbent companies spend way too much money on digital transformation efforts that fail to take the new economics and business models of digital disrupters into account 


-  Automating old business models is nothing more than that  it doesnt do  thing to help your company benefit from the disruptive price/performance ratios that digital tools can foster 


-  ,  There is  tremendous amount still to be learned about how to compete in  world moving at the pace of digital 


-  This places  huge premium on being able to learn quickly ,  experiment ,  and then pivot to reflect the insights gleaned 


-  Incumbents need to stop spending money trying to be  better version of their analog selves ,  and instead start approaching digital strategy with an eye toward discovery
