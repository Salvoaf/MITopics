-  Christensen first shared his Theory of Disruptive Innovation with the world ,  his thinking has led to the creation of billions of dollars of revenue ,  hundreds of companies ,  and an entirely new paradigm for how industry entrants upend established giants 


-  Karen Dillon  Christensens longtime collaborator and guest editor of this special issue of MIT Sloan Management Review  had  chance to sit down with him before his death in January to learn how he had refined his thinking ,  what the future of innovation looked like through that lens ,  and what questions he was still wrestling with 


-   fear that has happened to the core idea of the theory of disruption ,  which is important to understand because it is  tool that people can use to predict behavior 


-  By definition ,  these decisions reflect our preexisting ways of thinking about the world 


-  These ways of thinking are sometimes good and reliable  guided by known causal relationships 


-  ,   believe that in order for our scientific understanding of the world to progress ,  we must continually crawl inside companies ,  communities ,  and the lives of individuals to create new data in new categories that reveal new insights 


-  That is ,  big data tends to be far more focused on correlation rather than causation and as such ignores examples where something doesnt follow what tends to happen on average 


-  Its only by exploring anomalies that we can develop  deeper understanding of causation 


-  If you think about it ,  following  big data approach is what powered our understanding of the sun ,  moon ,  stars ,  and Earth for years ,  but it was only when Galileo peered through  telescope that we could start to understand more deeply how these celestial bodies moved in relation to one another 


-  Sustaining innovation ,  which most understand ,  is the process of making good products better 


-  This is important for any economy ,  but once  market is mature ,  it generates little net growth in terms of new factories ,  new jobs ,  new technology investments ,  and so forth 


-   third type of innovation consists of developing simple products for unserved populations who historically couldnt afford or didnt have access to something 


-  ,  My sense is that we in the United States ,  like many other developed countries ,  are investing far too much energy in efficiency and sustaining innovations ,  and not enough in market-creating innovations 


-  There are many reasons why this is occurring ,  but despite some recent incremental improvements to GDP and unemployment ,  the long-term economic picture doesnt seem too rosy to me as long as this more fundamental problem goes unaddressed 


-  ,  Christensen: Ill clarify  few things about the prediction 


-  Rather than focus on bankruptcy ,  which is hard for colleges to declare  ( for regulatory reasons )  ,  what well ultimately see is  lot of college closures and mergers 


-  So this problem is not going away 


-   think 50% is on the high end of the scale ,  but not out of the realm of possibility ,  and 25% to 30% of colleges failing over the next couple of decades is very realistic 


-  Although disruption  in the form of faster ,  more affordable ,  and more convenient college alternatives powered by online learning  is accelerating and  huge threat to established institutions ,  ultimately Ive always felt that the bigger imminent danger is that their business models simply arent sustainable 


-  So  dont believe that the threat of displacement is necessarily greater ,  but certainly the fact that digital platforms can emerge and expand is something that  just hadnt conceived of early in our research and deserves further study 


-  The forces that combine to cause disruption are like gravity  they are constant and are always at work within and around the firm 


-  ,  And in my experience ,  it seems that its often easier for executives to spot disruptions occurring in someone elses industry rather than their own ,  where their deep and nuanced knowledge can sometimes distract them from seeing the writing on the wall 


-  ,  Christensen: My colleagues and  have spent years trying to understand customer behavior  why someone would choose to buy one product or service over other options 


-  We believe that theres  better way to understand that choice 


-  When you understand that concept ,  the idea of uncovering consumer jobs makes intuitive sense 


-  Unless you understand the full context in which your customers are making  choice to hire your product or service ,  you will be unlikely to create the right offering for them 


-  Youll just be treading water with them until they fire your product and hire one that understands them better 


-  Reed Hastings intuitively understood that his customers hired Netflix to relax in their own homes ,  whenever they wanted 


-  Blockbuster focused on increasing its profitability  ( for instance ,  through the horrendous late fees we all sheepishly paid )  rather than understanding why we chose to hire  video in the first place 


-  ,  Christensen:  have always welcomed challenges to my thinking 


-   think understanding anomalies  what  theory doesnt explain  helps make the theory better and stronger 


-  My own thinking about the theory of disruption has evolved tremendously since  first published its findings in 1995 


-  My goal has never been to be right but to find the right answer 


-  Theyre very different things 


-  Ive long believed that asking the right questions is the only way to get to the right answer 


-  And understanding what questions to ask takes real work 


-  Its intertwined with the resource allocation process in the firm ,  in the changing needs of customers and potential customers ,  and in the constant evolution of technology 


-   am always wary when we hear that whatever is the high-flying company of the day has solved such  deep systemic problem 


-  The question for each is ,  when growth inevitably slows ,  and when those founders inevitably move on ,  have they developed the systems ,  processes ,  and culture to keep that fluidity? Or ,  when circumstances change ,  will the story end the same way it did for other paragons of good management? We will learn something interesting either way 


-  ,  Christensen: Ive gotten my share of things wrong 


-  And ,  to its credit ,  Apple then developed  business model that allowed it be  portable PC better than anyone else 


-  When someone tells me they are disruptive ,  the first question  always ask is ,  To what? This is an important question ,  because disruption is  relative concept 


-  Having just come back from an Airbnb board meeting ,  Marc described how Airbnb gives ordinary people  platform to offer their services ,  whether they are cooking  meal for their guests ,  hosting  class ,  or giving  tour of their hometown 


-  This meant they manufactured ,  distributed ,  sold ,  serviced ,  and designed goods for  non-consuming population ,  resulting in tremendous growth for their firm and their nation 


-  But Airbnb and others like it dont have to do any of those things ,  and yet they are creating opportunities all over the world 


-   am eager to explore further the growth potential of digital-first firms and understand what growth looks like in the years ahead 


-  Far too often ,  parents smother their children with lists ,  extracurriculars ,  and other good things so that children dont learn how to self-manage and regulate their own lives 


-  In our world ,  thats  vital skill kids need to have because of how distracted we are becoming 


-  ,  Christensen:  want to be remembered for my faith in God and my belief that he wants all of mankind to be successful 


-  The only way to make this happen is to help individual people become better people ,  and innovation is the key to unlocking evermore opportunities to do that
