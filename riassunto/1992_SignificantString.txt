-  on 26 March 1991 ,  the night crew at the Chaparral Steel minimill in Midlothian ,  Texas ,  cast the first production run of near net-shape steel beams in the United States 


-  General Manager Lou Colatriano grinned with tired satisfaction and headed home for his first break in forty-four hours 


-  From  sketch on  paper napkin to the first red-hot slab of metal that emerged from  patented mold to streak down the new mill line ,  the elapsed time was twenty-seven months 


-  That included design ,  mold development ,  modeling ,  pilot runs ,  and construction ,  and it represented expertise from five companies on three continents 


-  One of our core competencies ,  explained CEO Gordon Forward ,  is the rapid realization of new technology into products 


-  ,  Every manufacturing company in the United States would like to be able to make that statement 


-  Yet  steel mill seems an unlikely place to look for lessons on the quick commercial realization of inventions 


-  In fact ,  so does any factory ,  as innovation is generally associated with research laboratories and development organizations 


-  Moreover ,  we usually assume that the pressure to get product out the door conflicts with learning 


-  But as speed to market becomes an increasingly important criterion of competitive success ,  we need to rethink our concept of what  factory is 


-  ,  For decades ,   


-  factories were passive service organizations to the rest of the company ,  churning out products designed without benefit of manufacturing input and burying product and process defects under mountains of inventory 


-  The past decade has seen  transformation of many of these operations into low-inventory organizations dedicated to total quality and to active participation in new product development 


-  What is the next frontier for production? In this article  suggest that it is running operations as learning laboratories 


-  ,   learning laboratory is an organization dedicated to knowledge creation ,  collection ,  and control 


-  Contribution to knowledge is  key criterion for all activities ,  albeit not the only one 


-  In  learning laboratory ,  tremendous amounts of knowledge and skill are embedded in physical equipment and processes and embodied in people 


-  More important ,  however ,  are the nontechnical aspects ,  the managerial practices and underlying values that constantly renew and support the knowledge bases 


-  ,  In this article  put Chaparral Steel under the microscope as an example of  highly successful learning laboratory; its leadership has put tremendous effort into creating  consistent learning system 


-  As my references suggest ,  scholars studying best practices among Japanese manufacturers have made strikingly parallel observations ,  and Chaparrals policies are consistent with prescriptions by organizational learning theorists 


-  Its high-quality standards have been rewarded by the market ,  and it consistently sets records for productivity ,  compared to both  


-  ,   close look at the company reveals an organic learning system so tightly integrated that Forward says he can tour competitors through the plant ,  show them almost everything ,  and we will be giving away nothing because they cant take it home with them 


-  His confidence derives from the fact that the learning laboratory cannot be constructed piecemeal 


-  It is comprehensible only as an organic whole; close scrutiny is required to appreciate its delicacy 


-  To complicate matters ,  such  corporate ecosystem is in continuous flux ,  constantly regenerating itself 


-  Even if  competitor identifies important elements of the system ,  emulation will require time 


-  The Chaparral system has evolved in response to  turbulent competitive environment ,  as Forward observes: We have to go like hell all the time 


-  If the price of what we sell goes up too high ,   all of  sudden lots of folks will be jumping in 


-  And they can get into business in eighteen months or so  


-  We have to keep out front all the time 


-  ,   learning laboratory does not occur spontaneously but is designed ,  created ,  and maintained through constant managerial attention to communicating the underlying values ,  checking the management systems smallest details for consistency ,  and adapting any inharmonious elements 


-  Thus managers designing  learning laboratory need to adopt holistic ,  systems thinking 


-  They will have to acknowledge the practical utility and bottom-line impact of corporate values 


-  Everyone in the firm must appreciate the self-reinforcing nature of knowledge-creating activities 


-  Only by comprehending the whole system can one understand why ,  when  fragment of the learning laboratory is pulled out to be examined  (  particular project ,   specific learning activity )  ,  it comes out vinelike ,  trailing roots back to deeply held values and widely observed management practices 


-  ,  Learning requires creation and control of both external and internal knowledge for both current and future operations 


-  Therefore ,  four distinguishing activities are critical to  learning laboratory:  (  )  problem solving  ( in current operations )   (  )  internal knowledge integration  ( across functions and projects )   (  )  innovation and experimentation  ( to build for the future )  and  (  )  integration of external information flows  ( see Figure  )  


-  Each activity is the operational expression of an underlying value and is strongly supported by  compatible managerial system of procedures and incentives 


-  Thus each activity ,  value ,  and managerial system functions as an internally consistent subsystem 


-  Although  will describe each subsystem separately ,  the four are mutually aligned and interrelated; that is ,  values and managerial systems underlying one subsystem also support the other three 


-  An in-depth look at the four subsystems at Chaparral suggests some of the principles that distinguish  learning laboratory 


-  ,  Before exploring these subsystems ,  however ,  we need  brief explanation of Chaparrals near net-shape project ,  an innovative foray directly into the traditional territory of Big Steel that illustrates the companys knowledge creation and control subsystems 


-  ,  One way to push equipment performance and ensure learning is to set goals for each project considerably beyond current production capabilities 


-  Chaparral managers set  very ambitious goal for the near net-shape project: to produce large  ( eighteen-and twenty-four-inch wide )  structural steel I-beams for the same perpound cost as the simple round reinforcing bars  ( rebars )  ,  the companys first product 


-  The challenge was to produce  more difficult product for the same cost 


-  We decided on the twenty-four-inch because we wanted to explore the most technically challenging product 


-  Because there may be some idiosyncrasies about the process that we need to learn ,  we also chose  second size  based on the amount of North American consumption 


-  Reaching this cost objective  ( half of Big Steels )  required drastically reducing the energy costs  ( roughly 25 percent of total )  of rolling the steel into the required end shape 


-  The nearer to the final  ( net )  shape the molten steel could be cast ,  the less rolling required 


-  The steel-making molds and processes developed for the near net-shape project therefore embody knowledge beyond anything available on the market and ,  in fact ,  beyond anything the leading vendors of steel-making molds thought possible 


-  The approximately four-foot copper alloy tube through which the molten steel passes to emerge in nearly I-beam shape is set  very ambitious goal for the near net-shape project: to produce large  ( eighteen- and twenty-four-inch wide )  structural steel I-beams for the same per-pound cost as the simple round reinforcing bars  ( rebars )  ,  the companys first product 


-  &mldr; We decided on the twenty-four-inch because we wanted to explore the most technically challenging product 


-  Because there may be some idiosyncrasies about the process that we need to learn ,  we also chose  second size &mldr; based on the amount of North American consumption 


-  Reaching this cost objective  ( half of Big Steels )  required drastically reducing the energy costs  ( roughly 25 percent of total )  of rolling the steel into the required end shape deceptively simple in appearance 


-  However ,  the mold is patented ,  which suggests that the combined expertise of Chaparral designers and Italian and German mold fabricators endowed it with cutting-edge knowledge 


-  It is difficult to imagine how Chaparral could have succeeded in this knowledge-intensive project had the company not been run as  learning laboratory 


-  ,  Some of the activities ,  values ,  and managerial practices described below characterize any high-quality organization 


-  Since they operate as  system ,  we have to look at the whole operation to understand why emulating just some parts may never produce true learning laboratories 


-  ,  The first critical learning subsystem is the triad of  (  )  the independent problem solving required for continuous improvement of current processes ,  (  )  egalitarianism as an underlying value ,  and  (  )  shared rewards as the reinforcing incentives system  ( see Figure  )  


-  Empowered individuals ,  who command respect in the organization and who feel ownership in the system ,  have the self-confidence ,  freedom ,  and motivation to continuously solve problems 


-  The principle involved here turns the old production saw of if it aint broke ,  dont fix it on its head and maintains: if it aint being fixed continuously ,  its broke 


-  The often-articulated vision at Chaparral is to lead the world in the low-cost ,  safe production of high-quality steel 


-  For  learning lab ,  the test of  vision is the extent to which it permeates the whole organization ,  guiding every micro and macro decision 


-  Unless the vision can be directly translated into operational principles ,  that is ,  into guidelines for running the factory lines ,  it may have little effect on actual shop-floor behavior 


-  Chaparrals goal of leading the world requires innovation beyond the current cutting edge of production techniques 


-  Maintaining  cost advantage requires constant improvements in productivity 


-  The vision dictates that those improvements cannot come at the expense of quality or employee safety 


-  Therefore the goal for every hour ,  the criterion for every persons activity ,  is crystal clear: make ever more steel  increasingly better than anyone else 


-  We never stray far from the market ,  says Hunt 


-  At Chaparral ,  who owns  production problem and responsibility for its solution? An incident during the first few weeks of operating the near net-shape caster ,  when cooling hoses were bursting ,  provides some insight 


-  You just show up 


-  Everybody telephoned some person they thought might know how to fix the problem  vendors ,  experts  and within three to four hours we were getting calls back ,  says the senior operator 


-  Service people were showing up ,  and we worked the problem out 


-  If it had been just one guy ,  probably  foreman ,  and everyone walked out ,   it would have taken him ten times longer to find  solution 


-  ,  Because the performance goal is very clear ,  supervisors do not need to micromanage the line ,  and the organization runs lean 


-  For instance ,  two months after the first run of the near net-shape casting ,  the pulpit controls operator is carefully checking the timing on the line with  stopwatch 


-  You just take it upon yourself to roll as much steel as you can whether you are the pulpit operator ,  the roller ,  the furnace operator 


-  If it works ,  it is the de facto standard 


-  At Chaparral ,  there is no formal requirement ,  as at some Japanese companies ,  for  certain number of improvement suggestions from each employee 


-  Everyone is involved in some process improvement projects ,  and ,  as the foreman explains ,  We are all out here to make it run 


-  However ,  the benefits from general ownership of all problems are that it is not possible to pass the buck and no one expects  steady-state manufacturing process ever 


-  Outward symbols of values are important because they convey meaningful messages to all employees 


-  At Chaparral there are no assigned parking places ,  no different colored hard hats or uniforms reflecting title or position ,  and the company dining room is  local diner 


-  More unusual ,   scant two levels separate the CEO from operators in the rolling mill;  visitor is surprised when an operator stops Forward on  walk through the plant to discuss  new products problems 


-  Repeated requests to interview  particularly knowledgeable project manager are politely rebuffed with  shrug and an explanation from  vice president: Sorry ,  he just doesnt want to 


-  However ,  respect for the individual does not mean equality of responsibility ,  lack of discipline ,  or even consensual decision making 


-  Chaparral has taken unusual steps to ensure that performance and incentive systems back up managements belief in egalitarianism 


-  Even more radical  ( especially for  steel mill )  was the switch from hourly wages to salary for everyone 


-  There are no time clocks at Chaparral 


-  Why shouldnt everyone else? He is fond of saying that the management system was designed for the 97 percent who are conscientious people who want to put in  full days work 


-  For instance ,  in contrast to many factories ,  operators are not assigned to shifts according to seniority 


-  Everyone rotates into night shift ,   practice that fosters knowledge accumulation twenty-four hours  day and guards against  possible disproportionate accumulation of skills and knowledge in the most favored hours 


-  How do senior employees feel about that? During the summer in Texas ,  one foreman rationalizes with  grin ,  youd rather work at night 


-  ,  Steel-making is hot ,  dirty ,  demanding work; the pace of innovation and the constant pressure to produce more ,  better ,  and more safely in this organization exacerbate the brutal conditions imposed by the technology 


-  What keeps the workforce from burning out? One factor is the incentive systems that have evolved 


-  We think janitors and secretaries are important in our success ,  too ,  and they should share in the rewards ,  observes Forward 


-  In 1988 ,  each employee received one share for every year worked at the company; 62 percent buy additional shares every month through payroll deductions 


-   take better care not to waste anything because  feel like  am paying for it 


-  Scholars studying the relationship between such incentive systems and productivity have not reached consensus about the benefits of employee shareholding  ( partly because shareholding agreements vary widely )  


-  However ,  there is strong support for the notion that profit sharing generally does raise productivity 


-  ,  The second subsystem revolves around knowledge accrual  ( see Figure  )  


-  In the learning laboratory ,  knowledge is highly and visibly valued 


-  Management invests in educating the whole person ,  not just the technical side ,  and knowledge flows freely across boundaries 


-  The principle is this: every day ,  in every project ,  add to the knowledge resources 


-  ,  In  learning laboratory ,  one would expect to see visible embodiment of knowledge creation and control in highly innovative physical systems 


-  Because of the constant push to improve production ,  Chaparral managers have to design what they need ,  rather than purchase the best available equipment off-the-shelf Why design in-house? To keep the knowledge here ,   mill manager explains 


-  ,  The physical processes following the molding step are also knowledge intensive 


-  Chaparral processes seem clear outgrowths of skill ,  yet how does such expertise and knowledge accumulate? ,  Just as continuous processing has great advantages for manufacturing over most batch processing ,  so the unimpeded flow of information aids learning more than fragmented ,  batch-processed information 


-  In contrast ,  Chaparral management emphasizes homogenizing the level of knowledge throughout; few pockets of information are isolated by position ,  function ,  or working shift 


-  An individual garnering knowledge on  trip ,  at  conference ,  or from an experiment can readily transmit it ,  as all employees are located in the same place and know each other 


-  The company was also designed to facilitate knowledge flows by encouraging as many accidental meetings as possible 


-  Since many decisions go unrecorded and memos are anathema ,  it is important that people see each other frequently 


-  This is  do-it-yourself company with no acknowledged staff positions and only  few positions that seem stafflike ,  such as personnel 


-  In fact ,  everyone has line responsibilities ,  most of them tied directly to steel production ,  and decision making is pushed down to the lowest possible supervisory level ,  where the knowledge is 


-  Lead operators are selected for their knowledge-transmitting as well as knowledge-creating skills ,  because much knowledge flows horizontally among peers 


-  Work is structured with the objective of disseminating knowledge 


-  For instance ,  in commissioning the new mill that receives the near net-shape product  ( that is ,  ramping it up to problem-free production )  ,  only two teams of operators are being trained 


-  Each team works  twelve-hour shift  ( with paid overtime )  


-  After the initial eight weeks of this grueling schedule ,  these operators will be dispersed among the rest of the crews to diffuse the knowledge they have created and assimilated about the new processs idiosyncrasies 


-  The quality control department is responsible for reacting to quality problems identified by operators on the line  not by separate inspectors 


-   maintenance foreman notes that at Chaparral ,  we get involved with the whole process 


-  ,  Although the company has  marketing department ,  everyone is considered  salesperson 


-  Security guards do data entry while on night duty and are trained paramedics as well 


-  ,  No research and development  ( R&D )  department exists separate from production 


-  This statement has implications beyond the obvious that there is no research function 


-  Some of the problem solving and experimentation that are done in the midst of production involve research 


-  However ,  interfacing with the possessors of the latest scientific knowledge is not restricted to an elite group of specialists 


-  Knowledge accumulation in  learning lab cannot be the responsibility of  few special people 


-  But the first time  went into one of them  thought  was entering Forest Lawn [Cemetery] 


-  After you spend some time there ,  you realize you are in Forest Lawn 


-  Not because there are no good ideas there ,  but because the good ideas are dying there all the time 


-  When the worlds leading supplier was constructing the patented mold for the near net-shape project ,  the three-person team that shuttled back and forth to the site in Germany ,  learning about the fabrication process and serving as  source of information about the intended production process ,  included an operator 


-  As described later in Subsystem Four ,  Chaparral employees at all levels are constantly tapping into the latest ,  most current knowledge banks around the world 


-  ,  Since performance drives everything in this company ,  and individual incentives are tied to performance ,  employees seem engaged in  marathon relay race ,  where winning as  company team takes precedence over individual ownership of ideas ,  and knowledge is liberally shared 


-  There are acknowledged experts ,  such as the director of operations who is an equipment whiz ,  and the mold expert who was largely responsible for the near-net shape design ,  and the organization does not lack for large egos 


-  Lots of innovations take more than one good idea 


-  They go through  gestation period ,  and lots of people figure out how to make sense of it 


-  The point is to focus on the good of the whole 


-  ,  Chaparral employees are often unable to identify the source of production innovation 


-  In other places ,   few people do  lot of innovating 


-  Here  lot of people do little bits that add up 


-   millwright makes similar observations: No one is looked down upon 


-   am more than likely going to help him out  different time 


-  ,  An organization that values knowledge must provide mechanisms for continuous learning 


-  ( Most apprenticeships are run by unions 


-  )  As Forward notes ,  Expertise must be in the hands of the people that make the product 


-  ,  The roughly three-and-a-half-year program allows apprentices to progress to the level of senior operator/ craftsman by successfully completing  , 280 hours of on-the-job training and designated formal schooling 


-  The foremen of individual crews schedule the on-the-job training and evaluate the candidates systematic progression through various tasks in the factory 


-  For example ,   , 200 hours in steel-pouring operations is one qualification in the ladle metallurgy apprenticeship 


-  In addition ,  all apprentices complete study programs in safety ,  operating processes across the entire company ,  mathematics as related to operations ,  metallurgy ,  and basic mechanical maintenance in an effort to give all operators  solid basic understanding of the equipment used and the operating processes 


-  Scheduling this study ,  which requires four hours of unpaid work  week ,  is left up to the individuals ,  who have five options: home study with manuals and videos; in-plant study in instructor-monitored study rooms; formal classes; personalized tutoring by instructors; and study in work areas as operations permit 


-  ( Operators may also get credit for prior experience by proving knowledge on the job 


-  )  Courses include basic engineering knowledge such as conduction in liquids and gases ,  as well as very specific skills such as ladder logic programming for understanding programmable controllers and lubricant storage and handling 


-  Perhaps more surprising are such sessions as working with other people under troubleshooting skills 


-  ,  The most unusual aspect is the instructors 


-  Selected foremen rotate in from the factory floor to teach 


-  It creates  lot of credibility for the education program on the factory floor ,  explains one instructor 


-  ,  Chaparral also invests in outside courses of all types ,  tending to train its own people rather than hiring those with  particular skill 


-  In few factories would  furnace controls operator attend  Dale Carnegie-type course to help him enhance the interpersonal skills critical to smooth teamwork 


-  Line managers are expected to be technical experts ,  constantly up-to-date with cutting-edge technology  whether that be some aspect of metallurgy or human resources 


-  The manager of the scrap shredding operations ,  for instance ,  has just attended  conference on recycling  in the future ,  Chaparrals expertise in recycling may be an important corporate capability 


- 15 ,  The third subsystem in  learning laboratory involves constantly pushing knowledge frontiers  ( see Figure  )  


-  The company must select suppliers for their superior capabilities  and for their willingness to be pushed beyond the bounds of their current knowledge 


-  ,  Learning requires constant pushing beyond the known ,  and Chaparral employees are skilled experimenters 


-  This extremely technical presentation was to help directors understand the methodical knowledge-creation process ,  enable them to identify critical decision points ,  and thereby better equip them to evaluate the risk 


-  Another example of knowledge-creating experimentation more often found in research laboratories than factories is the one-sixth scale model of the near net-shape caster ,  which uses water to approximate the flow of steel 


-  Many creative simulations are conducted right on the production line 


-  The advantage is that the more closely the experimental environment approximates the final production environment ,  the more immediately relevant is the information generated 


-  The disadvantage is the obvious potential to disrupt production  which is why most factories prefer to isolate experimentation 


-  The soft molds held together just long enough to show this new casting processs feasibility 


-  Hunt explains ,  We use products to do research 


-  Here we rock the hell out of the boat 


-  We dont know the factorys limits 


-  When the German mold developers finished  prototype on schedule and called to ask how they should ship it ,  they were astonished to be told ,  Dont ship it at all; cut it up and make it look like this 


-   new mold would be required 


-  What surprised partners was that Chaparral did not appear to begrudge the wasted $40 , 000 per mold ,  since the knowledge engendered by each prototype enabled the next step in innovation 


-  In contrast ,  risk is usually anathema in  production environment 


-  Managers of  learning factory must tolerate ,  even welcome ,   certain amount of risk as  concomitant of knowledge acquisition 


-  Says Forward ,  We look at risk differently from other people 


-  We always ask what is the risk of doing nothing 


-  If everyone experiments ,  learns ,  and innovates ,  then neither success nor failure can be heavily personalized 


-  What happens when you try something and it doesnt work? What is the penalty? Everybody makes mistakes ,   Chaparral foreman responds 


-  You dont have to cover up  mistake here 


-  Since promoted to vice president of operations ,  Fournie is somewhat amused to find that visitors cant believe you can make  mistake like that and not get crucified 


-  He tries to take the same attitude toward those who work for him: You dont start them out on $1 


-  million projects ,  but you have to give them freedom to make mistakes 


-  Tenacity makes lots of projects work here that dont work other places  but when it just cant be done ,  its hard to call the project off 


-  One of his key criteria for determining if people are ready for promotion is whether they know when to ask for help ,  when to admit that they are in over their heads: Its  tough call &mldr; the hardest decision to learn to make 


-  Although top managers and  few specialized gurus at Chaparral have extensive steel experience ,  when Chaparral was first set up ,  management decided not to look for workers with industry experience 


-  Beach explains: We were looking for bright ,  enthusiastic ,  articulate people ,  and we preferred people who had not been exposed to other companies bad habits 


-  Chaparral looks for a twinkle in the eye ,   zest for life ,  for basically conscientious people who can put in  strong days work and enjoy what theyre doing 


-  This love of work is critical in an organization that deliberately runs somewhat understaffed to avoid laying people off during market downturns 


-  Highly selective hiring procedures continue to reflect concern that new employees fit into the Chaparral culture ,  that at least one supervisor be personally committed to their training and progress ,  and that the team have  stake in their success 


-  These very cautious ,  resource-intensive selection practices may account in part for the extremely dedicated workforce ,  which boasts an absentee rate about one-fourth that represented by the National Association of Manufacturers 


-  ,  Since people are the key resource in  knowledge-intensive organization ,  keeping them is critical 


- 17 Beach explains: From the very beginning ,  we designed this organization with Maslows hierarchy of needs in mind [i 


-  ,  that once peoples basic needs for food ,  shelter ,  and belonging are satisfied ,  they will aspire to  fourth level of need ,  self-esteem ,  and finally ,  the fifth ,  self-actualization 


-   know its not stylish ,  but we really believe in that hierarchy ,  so we constantly look at what will help people become self-actualized ,  at their ego needs 


-  Asked what he looks for in  job ,   millwright responds: As long as  am moving forward ,   can think for myself: and  feel that  am contributing ,   will be happy 


-  Chaparral managers believe that skilled ,  innovative people will leave an organization if they see no possibility for personal growth 


-  Management has learned the necessity of training in advance of the need because of problems experienced early in the companys history ,  when operators who were automatically moved up into lead and then supervisory positions as vacancies opened proved underprepared 


-  In response ,  Chaparral management established such idiosyncratic practices as viceing 


-  When  similar absence occurs at Chaparral ,  the prior foreman works the extra hours ,  at his usual pay level ,  but in  subordinate role 


-   supervisor explains ,  You get  little pay increase and  whole lot more responsibility  got  chance to see whether  really wanted to be  foreman or not ,  and it gives you  little respect for the bosss job 


-  Recently the production managers for the three mills were given the title of general manager and asked to learn each others jobs and to cover for each other 


- 19 ,   learning laboratory obviously needs access to the latest knowledge ,  embodied in the best minds and best equipment available 


-  ,  At Chaparral ,  employees constantly scan the world for technical expertise that others have already invested in 


-  Managers never hesitate to invent when necessary but only after assuring themselves through extensive searches that no available system will suit their needs 


-  Three on-site laboratories support production through chemical and physical product analysis ,  but the company has created  virtual research organization through extensive networking and alliances 


-  Information obtained externally is rapidly incorporated through development projects ,  flowing through the created network almost as readily as it does inside the walls of the learning laboratory ,  because in both cases people working directly in production transmit the knowledge 


-  Chaparral employees visited the German vendor every few weeks ,  and ultimately Chaparrals expertise combined with the Germans cutting-edge knowledge to produce  patented mold that neither company could have made alone 


-  Since it had not yet built its own rolling mill ,  and none existed anywhere that could receive the novel shape ,  managers identified  production laboratory in Mexico with very flexible equipment 


-  Chaparrals superintendent of steel-melt technology went to Mexico to direct the simulation of the future mill design ,  using Mexican equipment and workers 


-  However ,  knowing such sources of expertise exist would be useless if the factory were not able to tap them ,  to jointly create more knowledge ,  and then to absorb that knowledge into the production system 


-  ,  Chaparrals collegial knowledge network seems more characteristic of  research laboratory than of  factory 


-  Possibly because of Forwards early career as  research metallurgist ,  the company aggressively pursues the latest knowledge 


-  Chaparral sought the coveted Japanese certification for steel ,  not because managers thought they would ever sell much steel in Japan ,  but because they believed the Japanese would go through the companys process carefully  and Chaparral would learn much from the exercise 


-  Forward takes  distinctly nontraditional view of environmental scanning for  factory: By the time you hear about  technology in  paper at  conference ,  it is too late 


-  This philosophy explains why Chaparral invests in unorthodox knowledge-gathering mechanisms ,  for instance ,  by cosponsoring  research conference with the Colorado School of Mining about  new alloy under investigation 


-  The most notable example is the previously mentioned electric arc saw 


-  The mill manager left the saw in place for almost  year to allow time for everyone to attempt solutions and to accept failure ,  while he sought an alternative technology: It is not clear that an in-house R&D facility would have helped in this case because the required invention lay in the unfamiliar realm of electromagnetic fields 


-  Managers at Chaparral believe that through their virtual R&D organization ,  they can actually tap  larger variety of knowledge bases than they would be able to support internally ,  given their size 


-  Still ,  they will have to continue investing in internal expertise in order to integrate the externally obtained knowledge 


-  There is no value in recreating something  only in building on the best existing knowledge 


-  People in  learning laboratory value the capability to absorb and use knowledge as much as to create it 


-  As its practices suggest ,   key Chaparral value is global outreach  openness to innovation ,  whatever its origin 


-  Knowledge is valued not so much for the pedigree of its source but for its usefulness 


-  ,  To support information gathering and reinforce global outreach ,  the company invests heavily in employee travel  ( and regards the expenses as just that  investments )  ,  often sending  team ,  including foremen and technical staff as well as vice presidents and operators ,  to investigate  new technology or to benchmark against competitors 


-  Newly acquired knowledge need not filter down through the ranks ,  because the people who absorbed it are the ones who will apply it 


-  In 1990 ,  seventy-eight people from production ,  several of them operators ,  visited  customer site at least once 


-  Forward elaborates: We send the people who can best tell us whats going on  whoever they are 


-  In 1985 ,  while seeking Japanese suppliers ,  they identified  high-quality company that was not doing much development 


-  ,  They are  source of information for the company as  whole 


- 21 ,  The factory in fact any backroom operation ,  is not usually regarded as an arena for experimentation and learning 


-  Moreover ,  the whole organization is designed around the creation and control of knowledge 


-  The organization is unlikely to be open to outside knowledge if it does not place  strong value on sharing knowledge or does not give rewards for bettering the whole companys performance 


-  Thus continuous learning depends upon the sense of ownership derived from the incentive systems ,  upon the pride of accomplishment derived from special educational systems ,  upon values embedded in policies and managerial practices ,  as well as upon specific technical skills 


-  The line operator appears to take the same perspective on the conduct of daily activities as the CEO 


- 22  learning laboratory may have trouble recreating itself Any organization is likely to be somewhat limited by its congenital knowledge and by the stamp placed upon it by its founders 


-  Forward has noted that to stand still is to fall behind ,  and the companys credo to provide growth for its skilled people requires some forward momentum 


-  How will it transplant the deep worker knowledge ,  the motivation ,  the commitment ,  and the informal systems of knowledge sharing? ,  For other companies interested in creating factories as learning laboratories ,  the questions are: Can it be done in  plant within  large corporation ,  where many of the managerial systems have already been set corporatewide and therefore are not at the plant managers discretion? Can an existing plant be transformed when plant managers may not have the luxury of selecting people as freely as Chaparral did? Can  company less geographically isolated hope to reap returns on investing in its employees intellectual advancement ,  or will they be lured away by other companies? ,  Similar questions were raised  decade ago when  


-  manufacturers first began to understand how Japanese companies were competing on the basis of quality 


-  Initially overwhelmed by the difference in activities ,  values ,  and managerial systems implied by the total quality approach ,  many  


-  managers were pessimistic about their ability to change their operations to the extent needed and reluctant to invest in employee education 


- -based factories achieve quality levels never even aspired to in 1980 


- 26 As the references at the end of this article suggest ,  many of Chaparrals managerial practices and values also characterize best practices in Japan ,  such as investing extensively in formal and informal education; searching worldwide for the best technology and methods and absorbing that knowledge into home operations; and valuing employee empowerment ,  problem solving ,  and risk taking 


-  factories can start up from scratch ,  creating  learning laboratory implies big changes 


-  But do we really have any choice? No financial formulas ,  corporate reshuffling of departments ,  or exhortations by corporate management to integrate across functions will foster the creativity and productivity needed for international competition 


-  ,  Experts on change management suggest that three critical elements are required for altering current practices:  (  )  dissatisfaction with the status quo;  (  )   clear model of what the changed organization will look like; and  (  )   process for reaching that model ,  that vision of the future
