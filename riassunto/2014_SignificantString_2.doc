- Rising labor costs in China and other emerging economies ,  high supply chain and logistics costs ,  and wide differentials in the costs for electricity and natural gas in different parts of the world are provoking  fresh round of relocation of manufacturing and production 


-  While some labor-intensive jobs are moving out of China to Southeast Asia or the next emerging low-cost regions ,  some high-profile manufacturing work is returning to the United States ,  to the cheers of some who are proclaiming the beginnings of  manufacturing renaissance 


-  Wal-Mart holds supplier conferences to promote Made in  


-  ,  and the retail giant encourages manufacturers to commit to producing in the United States by promising to purchase $50 billion more in  


-  Consultants proclaim the reemergence of the United States as  competitive place for manufacturing  and are pushing their services with reshoring conferences ,  reports and lots of advice 


-  ,  While the macroeconomic data on comparative labor and factor costs may be compelling ,  the actual process of reshoring  bringing assembly work back from abroad  is hard work 


-  This is especially true when the resources upon which  company draws  ( the supplier base ,  the workforce ,  and even the companys own internal product design capabilities )  have atrophied 


-  In an earlier paper ,  my Harvard colleague Gary Pisano and  documented the loss of the industrial commons in the United States ,  the shared resource base upon which manufacturers draw 


- s Appliance Park operations in Louisville ,  Kentucky; Googles efforts in partnership with Flextronics International Ltd 


-  to assemble the MotoX smartphone in Fort Worth ,  Texas;  high-end technology product manufactured at Flextronics facilities in Austin ,  Texas; as well as comparison factories in Europe and Asia 


-  )  What can we learn from these efforts to help managers prepare for reshoring? ,  The benefits were no surprise 


-  More importantly ,  the closeness reduces the length of ordering cycles ,  enabling companies to respond more quickly to market changes 


-  Thus ,  it was important to pay  wage rate that was globally competitive when adjusted for productivity ,  and there can be no compromises on quality 


-  Stabilizing the workforce ,  addressing organizational skills gaps ,  rethinking the capital/labor ratio ,  localizing the supply base and rethinking product design to leverage the proximity to manufacturing turned up consistently as important focus areas for managers 


-  ,  In this article ,   reflect on the experiences of these large reshoring projects and make recommendations for managers who are considering the United States as  location choice for new product-assembly operations 


-  Whats more ,  while most of the observations in this article are specific to reshoring in the United States ,  they contain insights that are relevant to markets and production around the globe 


-  ,  Establishing product-assembly operations means hiring people ,  often in large numbers 


-  Appliance Park had  goal of hiring  , 500 new workers; the reshoring project in Fort Worth had the same target 


-  Finding enough people with the right skills  and finding them fast enough to support the ramp-up of operations  was an enormous challenge 


-  Fort Worth used six employment agencies to recruit job applicants ,  but the percentage of workers who first made it through the screening process and then continued past the first few days or weeks on the job to become  part of the regular workforce was depressingly low 


-  By Friday ,  they were gone ,  recounted  manager in Fort Worth 


-  Over the course of 10 weeks ,  the company had to hire  , 500 workers to yield the required  , 500 employees to begin volume production 


-  ,  High worker turnover is  problem on the shop floor because it injects variability and unpredictability into production schedules 


-   factory cannot run  manufacturing line with consistent output and quality without  stable workforce 


-  The same people need to come to work every day and run the production processes in  repeatable and consistent way 


-  Constantly having to replace workers who drop out is not  path to success; the expenses associated with recruiting and training new employees when so many walk out the door are substantial 


-  ,   found that this problem had two main components: worker understanding and expectations of what  modern factory production job is ,  and managements ability to give workers reasons to stay 


-  Lean production systems ,  extensive use of measurement and information technology on the shop floor ,  and sophisticated quality systems have transformed the roles of frontline production and supply chain logistics workers 


-  Yet worker perceptions of what manufacturing jobs entail have not kept pace 


-  Many fresh recruits come to the job with inadequate preparation and an unrealistic view of what might be expected of them 


-  We hired people off the couch ,  remarked one plant manager 


-  ,  As  result ,  it was not surprising that many workers didnt have  clear picture of what the factory environment was like 


-  As another manager noted ,  the long-term unemployed represented  major pool from which companies drew 


-  They were prepared neither for the expectations placed on them nor the environment in which they would be working 


-  One Fort Worth manager commented that high attrition was an inevitable consequence 


-  If you looked in the trash can at the building exit ,  we found  lot of badges that workers discarded on their way out the door 


-  If  company is going to invest in training and the development of the skill base of its production workers ,  how can it ensure that they will stay on and help turn the investment into  long-term capability? ,  As for offering workers  reason to stay ,  Appliance Park managers have tackled the problem of job abandonment by segmenting their remediation efforts into two phases: pre-employment and post-employment 


-  One of the most effective pre-employment activities has been to encourage applicants to complete training and certification 


-  Short term ,  this meant looking for people who had participated in training and certification programs such as Certified Production Technician or Certified Logistics Technician programs developed by the Manufacturing Skills Standards Council ,  an industry-led organization in the United States 


-  Although MSSC certifications are not the only vehicle ,  the idea was to encourage prospective employees to make some type of co-investment in making their job work 


-  There was  healthy measure of self-selection among participants who completed these programs 


-  ,  In the programs ,  candidates developed proficiency in fundamental factory skills ,  and their personal investment in training tended to increase their level of commitment to staying 


-  Almost two-thirds of the MSSC certification candidates received their certification in less than three months; they arrived at the factory with  better understanding of what they would face and what the work entailed 


-  ,  Flextronics managers found that thoroughly explaining the content of factory work and the expectations on the shop floor were vital to reducing turnover 


-  For example ,  many new recruits didnt know how to react to fluctuating demand ,  which resulted in day-to-day volatility in the level of the work 


-  Managers across all the sites we studied also stressed the need to set clear expectations about showing up for work on time and getting work done on time 


-  I cant run  25-person line with three people late ,  explained one manager 


-  ,  Success in reducing job dropouts post-hiring occurred most often when companies built  skills progression system that showed workers  path to more highly skilled and responsible positions 


-  While extrinsic motivators such as compensation and benefits  ( especially health care benefits )  contributed to retention ,  they appeared to be less important than intrinsic motivators focused on achievement and personal growth 


-  ,  Appliance Park managers built  path for entry-level plastic injection molding machine employees that progressed through three A levels for operators ,  followed by three B levels of molding technician and three C levels of molding processor positions 


-  It also gave them opportunities to move from A level operator into different paths in positions in quality and inspection ,  or conveyance and logistics 


-  This internal skill-building and credentialing system aligned well with manufacturing needs ,  but more importantly ,  it gave workers goals to aspire to as well as an ability to gauge their own progress 


-  Fort Worth managers were keen to publicize successes ,  such as an individual worker who reached  new level of achievement or successes among veterans or disabled workers 


-  ,  Managers at other companies preferred to do training in-house ,  finding that schools often didnt have  strong enough connection with current manufacturing practices to do even basic-level training 


-  Flextronics managers in Austin had to recruit and train almost  , 000 new employees for the Assembled in USA technology project 


-  But they were able to draw upon 170 different training programs that the site already offered in  wide range of production technologies  ranging from the operation of electronic component placement machines to basic quality and lean production methodologies 


-  ,  Longer term ,  many companies are increasingly working with local community colleges to incorporate industry credential systems and/or training into the schools programs and to attract students 


-  Some manufacturers ,  including Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky in Georgetown ,  Kentucky ,  are anticipating approaching retirement cliffs as their workforce ages and are using training programs as vehicles to fill an impending need for new workers 


-  Others ,  such as BMW in South Carolina ,  work closely with local schools in work-study arrangements and help with curriculum design 


-  In  very real way ,  these are investments in the health of an important element of the industrial commons 


-  ,  The United States has  generational skills deficiency in many important technical areas ,   challenge that is also evident in many other countries that have experienced significant offshoring 


-  In contrast to China ,  which has developed vast pools of technical resources ,  the United States and Europe havent trained enough young people in these areas 


-  In the United States ,  there is still strength in the automotive ,  construction equipment and aerospace sectors  ( although far less than there was 20 years ago )  


-  However ,  the gaps in metalworking and metallurgy  welding ,  machining ,  forging and casting ,  metal finishing and plating ,  precision machining and operating sophisticated machine tools  are acute 


-  The offshoring of high-volume assembly jobs over the last two decades means there also arent enough automation engineers and other specialists to support the setup of extensive new assembly operations 


-  This was painfully evident in Austin ,  where Flextronics had to pull automation engineers in from  sister factory in Guadalajara ,  Mexico 


-  ,  For some products for which much of the manufacturing has moved offshore ,  there are generational skills gaps in both product development and the shop floor 


-  Its hard to find Americans who can operate  modern printed circuit board line ,  let alone program the automatic placement or advanced optical inspection tools that populate it 


-  Simply hiring  capable workforce doesnt translate into restoring manufacturing capabilities; frequently ,  the basic processes have to be rebuilt or transplanted back from offshore 


-  Our operations management leadership program ended up becoming training of procurement agents ,  explained one of the Appliance Park leaders 


-  We didnt even have  pipeline of emerging manufacturing talent ,  because it had become all about sourcing goods 


-  Rather than having  focus on design for manufacture and efficient assembly and processing ,  companies had concentrated on low-cost ,  competitive sourcing 


-  ,  In Fort Worth ,  Flextronics management flew in  team of 150 manufacturing leaders from around the world  including  skilled manufacturing manager from Hong Kong who years earlier had built  Nokia handset factory on the same site  to establish basic processes 


-  Over  10-week period ,  the team established all the basic assembly ,  test and logistics processes for inbound and outbound supply chains ,  as well as training the initial production workforce ,  an engineering support organization and support organizations like the moonshine shop ,  which built and modified production fixtures 


-  They left behind five experienced managers who then continued to train and oversee the workforce 


-  When we were hiring directors ,  senior managers and managers ,  we could not find anyone under the age of 40 ,  explained the plant manager at Fort Worth 


-  The United States has abandoned that part of the industry with all of the offshoring ,  and we will need to rebuild this base for electronic manufacturing if we want it to come back 


-  ,  Flextronics was able to draw on  global resource pool because it frequently established new facilities or moved existing manufacturing operations as part of routine consolidations 


-  Appliance Park faced  similar skills challenge ,  and while it could draw upon some existing resources ,  it couldnt simply fly in an experienced team 


-  We doubled the size of our operations leadership program ,  and had those people shadow the graybeards to build up the knowledge 


-  ,  The key challenge in both cases was to establish shop floor leadership that could not only launch production but could also quickly engage in process-improvement projects to drive quality and production yield improvements 


-  The workforce is brand new ,  the equipment is brand new ,  you have to have the workforce to pull it all together ,  explained one of the GE managers 


-  Nobody coming out of college these days is knowledgeable or excited about doing this kind of work ,  commented  manager at Fort Worth 


-  We cant afford to only hire people who are over 40 or bring people in from abroad 


-  This problem was  long time in the making ,  and it cant be solved overnight 


-  When work was offshored from the United States or Europe to Asia over the last two decades ,  the principal driver was labor arbitrage 


-  With that offshoring came substantial substitution of labor for capital  the replacement of hard automation using expensive capital equipment with manual processes 


-  So when work comes back ,  most people assume that we will simply go back to using more automation 


-  Manufacturing in China enabled rapid product changeovers ,  and we trained consumer markets worldwide to expect this kind of flexibility 


-  If you want to have five million new smartphones on hand to sell on the first weekend after  new phone model launches ,  you will need  lot of people ,  not automation 


-  While the latest automation technologies often have reduced setup or changeover times ,  managers should not assume that we should necessarily use more robots 


-  ,  The key considerations are length of product run and frequency of changeover 


-  Investments were expected to have  one-year payback for unique tools and  two-year payback for tools that could be reused 


-  ,  In Austin ,  Flextronics managers built several no-touch electronic printed circuit board lines 


-  In this particular case ,  the sophistication of the boards ,  the exacting quality level and the very low mix of product types to be produced justified investment in  higher level of automation 


-  Direct labor content was therefore comparatively low 


-  In Austin ,   supervisor could oversee two no-touch lines; in China ,   supervisor oversaw one line staffed with 13 dedicated operators 


-  ,   recently visited  medical products factory in Denmark where the production engineers were continually experimenting with the balance between manual and automated processing 


-  Having  slightly higher mix of manual operations promoted significantly more flexibility ,  and as the production engineers configured processing equipment for locations in eastern Europe and the Far East ,  they adjusted the labor mix in accordance with the labor costs 


-  Even in high-labor-cost Denmark ,  the engineers were careful to avoid over-automating 


-  ,  The more important management issue is how to redeploy workers who are freed by process improvements or the substitution of automation 


-  How does one translate these gains into sustaining growth? ,  Recognizing the critical link to workforce stability ,  Appliance Park managers established  strategy that would increase the amount of vertical integration  bringing work back in-house to utilize labor freed up from productivity improvements 


-  That has risks ,  of course ,  because it means less flexibility in adjusting to demand variability 


-  But if production operators are secure in the knowledge that improving productivity will translate into growth and not job losses ,  their goals will be aligned with managements 


-  ,  When manufacturing went through the first big waves of offshoring to China ,  companies often used kitting of parts to keep assembly lines supplied 


-  ,  Over time ,  China-based manufacturers localized their supply chains ,  inviting key suppliers to set up near them to reduce costs and shorten replenishment times 


-  They also replaced suppliers who didnt move 


-  This lowered costs and had the ancillary benefit of lowering duties for sales to the Chinese domestic market 


-  ,  In such industries ,  moving production back to  country such as the United States therefore often means  manager will face  hollowed-out supply base 


-  This is certainly the case for many electronic devices  for example ,  almost all of the parts for the MotoX came from China ,  Korea or elsewhere in Asia 


-  In the United States ,  there are no domestic suppliers of touchscreen displays or batteries ,  and most of the circuit boards and components had to come from abroad as well 


-  Ironically ,  the fragile components had to be kitted and carefully packed ,  and the physical volume of material that had to be moved meant higher logistics costs than if the phone had simply been assembled in Asia 


-  The value density of the parts was much lower than that of completed phones 


-  Thus ,  the economic benefits of customization and nearness to market had to substantially exceed the increased transportation and supply chain logistics costs 


-  They recognized that ,  internally ,  they had lost  whole generation of manufacturing engineers ,  so they had to pick the areas where they wanted to focus and rebuild core competencies 


-  Pick where you want to invest in core competencies ,  and acknowledge where you want to have strategic suppliers  where you arent going to make the deep investment yourselves ,  explained  manager there 


-  ,  Rebuilding  supplier ecosystem takes commitment 


-  The long-term development of capabilities becomes far more important than short-term haggling over price 


-  Some have described the new model as\nco-innovation   cooperative ,  tight partnership between an original equipment manufacturer and its suppliers that entails  much higher level of information sharing and collaboration to solve design and production problems 


-  ,  The key premise behind reshoring is that closeness to product design ,  reduced order cycles and lower costs of carrying inventory in the pipeline should offset higher absolute production costs 


-  So how can corporate customers help? ,   retailer such as Wal-Mart  ( or  manufacturer supplied by  


-  factories )  can actually do  great deal to improve the efficiency of the overall supply chain by active partnering and by providing greater transparency to demand 


-  This doesnt necessarily mean rock-solid forecasts and orders that are finalized earlier; rather ,  it means earlier and more frequent sharing of demand signals ,  as well as  commitment to work together to improve overall supply chain efficiency for the longer term 


-  ,  Manufacturing partners that have more visibility to what is coming ,  whether demand will move up or down ,  can better react to changes 


-  This isnt  surprise to experienced supply chain managers ,  who know that communications is key to efficiency: Its what we teach in supply chain classes 


-  Yet many of us have not yet learned this lesson  or have yet to recognize that the requirement to communicate extends beyond the walls of ones own organization 


-  Any supply chain will perform better with open communication and visibility across all its segments ,  but  supply chain centered on  fast-response local production factory will benefit much more than one that has weeks or months of inventory in ocean containers coming from China 


-  ,  The generational skills gap created by offshoring also increased the distance between product designers and those who did the actual assembly work on the shop floor 


-  When companies first moved production offshore ,  the production processes were well understood ,  so the linkages could be maintained 


-  But as product designs changed and new advanced technologies evolved and were incorporated ,  the difficulties in reimagining production have increased 


-  Having the work in-house is important for our learning 


-  Having that design piece of this thing on-site ,  having the design team interact with the operators who actually make it ,  and seeing the tools open up on the bench ,  how the tool works ,  the thought process  learning that and how that cycles back into the design  there is  value to that ,  explained the head of the plastics competency center at Appliance Park 


-  Flextronics managers characterized this linkage as  competitive edge for R&D teams ,  as incremental innovations most often come when teams get their hands dirty in the production environment 


-  That meant moving more value-add components and parts critical to the differentiation of the final product in-house or into the hands of  strategic supply partner 


-  Fort Worth developed  similar late customization capability  the ability to rapidly deliver  customized color and\ninscription patterns for consumers who wanted  unique product 


-  The combination of the two can produce sustainable advantages that can keep production onshore and close to the market beyond the current favorable economic environment 


-  ,  Offshoring from the United States and other high-cost economies to low-cost emerging market countries was  dominant theme of manufacturing in the late 1990s and 2000s 


-  Now reshoring offers the promise of reestablishing the link between product design and manufacturing ,  between original equipment manufacturers and strategic supplier ecosystems 


-  As managers work through the challenges described in this article ,  the big picture is shifting away from the centrality of labor-cost arbitrage as  driver of location decisions 


-  Instead ,  it is moving to the supplier ecosystems as  key complementary asset and the importance of developing people ,  skills and organizational capabilities that make the most of closeness to the market 


-  ,  These changes have broad implications for not just the United States ,  but other markets as well 


-  Rising demand for manufactured products in emerging markets means that managers must design supply chains for the production of goods that balance proximity to diverse markets with the locations of their capabilities and their supply ecosystems 


-  In many ways ,  the challenges of reshoring to the United States are the challenges of establishing production and supply to serve any market in the world 


-  Doing that well will always be  source of competitive advantage
