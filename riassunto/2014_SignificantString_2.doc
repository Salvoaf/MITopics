-  But its worth asking: Is your pricing model one of your core competencies? And does it provide you with  competitive advantage? If your answer to these questions is no ,  then it may be time to rethink the way you look at pricing 


-  If you sense that your company is leaving good money on the table and struggling to convert product differentiation into revenue and profits ,  then you should consider enlisting the help of unlikely partners: your customers 


-  To be sure ,  the thought of working with customers on  critical business activity such as pricing can be unnerving for managers 


-  However ,  in the same spirit that companies today are recruiting customers to improve product design and marketing communications ,  managers need to recognize that its those who purchase  companys products or services who ultimately determine what they are worth 


-  While customers need not have sole discretion over these activities ,  they can certainly provide important input 


-  Its critical to recognize that outsourcing pricing to customers isnt an all-or-nothing proposition: Managers can select pricing models ranging from complete oversight to complete delegation 


-  ,  In this article ,  we integrate classic views on pricing with the latest research and practice to develop  simple framework to help managers decide how much pricing control they should retain and how much they should relinquish to customers 


-  )  To be clear ,  we do not recommend that companies go out and fire their pricing teams and invite customers to pay whatever they wish 


-  Should they try to maintain control over pricing? Should they collaborate with their customers? Or should they let customers call the shots? To clarify the choices ,  we outline three general philosophies to pricing  company-imposed pricing ,  collaborative pricing and customer-imposed pricing  and then present specific models that exist within each 


-  Although there may be different views within an organization about how to arrive at the right price ,  there is no question that the company has full control under this approach and that customers are bystanders 


-  To the extent that there are variations in how different customers value products ,  selecting one number implies that those prepared to pay more in effect receive  discount; those willing to pay less  ( but who are still profitable )  are turned away 


-  This is the domain of personalized prices ,  in which data analytics help companies identify characteristics of the purchase environment or the customers profile and behavior that impact willingness to pay 


-  In the United States ,  for example ,  The Wall Street Journal found that office superstore Staples adjusted prices on its website ,  apparently based on ,  among other factors ,  the distance  customer was from Office Max or Office Depot brick-and-mortar stores 


-  First ,  companies need abundant ,  high-quality data 


-  Second ,  they need to overcome the organizational challenges that are likely to surface  dedication to advanced analytics may require changing management styles and human resource policies 


-  And third ,  companies should be prepared for pushback from customers claiming that the approach isnt fair 


-  ,  Although personalization can lead to lower prices ,  just as it can lead to higher prices ,  setting prices based on contextual and customer information can be controversial 


-  This involves managing multiple price points and giving customers choices 


-  Customers can select the combination of brand ,  price and features that yields the greatest amount of net satisfaction for them 


-  From the companys perspective ,  the trick is to put together an assortment that not only achieves the highest sales volume possible but also maximizes revenue by motivating customers to select the car thats priced closest to their willingness to pay 


-  ,  Companies pursuing the purchase-requirement approach give customers the opportunity to pay lower prices when they meet certain requirements such as buying sooner ,  in greater quantity or more frequently 


-  The issue for customers ,  of course ,  is whether the potential savings justify the cost or inconvenience of doing whats required 


-  For companies ,   big concern is cannibalization: giving discounts to customers who in fact would be willing to pay the full price 


-  ,  The reality is that price menus can be frustrating for customers 


-  If customers struggle to make sense of an assortment of choices and are unsure which product suits them best ,  they may think that the seller isnt being forthright and is trying to manipulate them to buy more than they want or need 


-  Similarly ,  if customers feel that meeting the purchase requirement is out of their control ,  then they may act out against the seller in an attempt to reassert their autonomy 


-  For example ,  Uber ,  the San Francisco-based transportation network that connects passengers and drivers via  mobile phone application ,  has recently been criticized for its practice of charging customers inflated surge prices during periods of peak demand 


-  Negotiations are common in business markets ,  where face-to-face consultative selling makes sense ,  and also in some consumer markets 


-  surveys ,  86% of mobile phone customers and 85% of pay TV customers who asked for  better deal were successful in getting one; whats more ,  42% of the mobile phone discounts received and 26% of the pay-TV discounts the consumers were offered were ongoing rather than just for  limited time 


-  Of course ,  it is also an opportunity for the different parties to exert influence and gain the upper hand 


-  In the end ,  customers with good negotiating skills can have  significant say in the final price 


-  ,  Under pay-as-you-wish ,  the company delegates responsibility for pricing to the customer 


-  Customers can pay any amount they desire  ( even zero )  ,  and sellers are committed to honoring their obligation 


-  ,  The obvious limitation of pay-as-you-wish is that customers may be tempted to undermine sellers with unreasonably low prices 


-  Another option is to suggest  payment amount or to develop guidelines to nudge customers toward  higher figure 


-  Bonvoy Adventure Travel ,  based in New York City ,  for example ,  lists the hard cost of its trips and clearly communicates the markup added to reach the retail price; under its flex pricing approach ,  customers can request trip discounts 


-  In addition to allowing purchasers to name their price ,  it encourages them to decide how they want to allocate the payments among game developers ,  charities and Humble Bundles organizers  thereby advancing feelings of fairness and altruism 


-  ,  How much pricing input from customers should  business seek? Selecting the right pricing model is conditioned by two important considerations 


-  Therefore ,  its useful to have  sense for which models are best suited to  particular environment 


-  ,  In order to figure out the best approach to pricing ,  managers need to ask themselves up to four questions: ,   


-  The first question is designed to probe how customers value the product: Is there  significant disparity among customers in their valuations of your product? If the answer is no ,  then there is no reason to ask customers to take part in the pricing process ,  and managers are probably better off retaining control and continuing with  single fixed price 


-  However ,  if there are significant differences in the way different customer groups value  product ,  there are potential advantages to customer participation ,  which leads to the second question: Can my company document these differences in valuation with confidence? If the answer is yes and the key drivers of value are known and observable ,  managers hoping to squeeze more revenue out of the market can go ahead and personalize prices 


-  However ,  if the value drivers are not known or are difficult to ascertain ,  managers may want to develop  price menu that encourages customers to reveal their valuations through their choices 


-  In practice ,  many companies lack the necessary know-how to implement personalized prices or design clever price menus 


-  If thats the case ,  managers should consider  third question: Do customers understand what our product is worth to them If managers fear that the answer is no and that customers are not sufficiently educated about the product ,  then they need  pricing model such as negotiation that allows companies to interact with prospective customers 


-  On the other hand ,  if customers are already familiar with  companys offerings yet have different valuations for them that are hard for the company to identify up front ,  managers need to advance to the final question: Is demand for my product likely to outstrip its supply? If the answer is yes ,  then it may make sense to run an auction ,  which is meant to identify the people who place the highest valuations on your offerings 


-  If the answer is perhaps ,  however ,  managers need to be wary about entering into  situation in which demand uncertainty puts excessive downward pressure on prices 


-  In other words ,  they need to get  sense of demand before settling on  price 


-  When theres plenty of supply and varying customer valuations ,  companies want to motivate customers to reveal their true valuations  valuations that are otherwise hard to observe and measure 


-  Pay-as-you-wish grants customers the autonomy to express their individual preferences 


-  ,  The second consideration in determining which pricing model to use is cost 


-  Managers need to assess the incremental resources necessary  ( money ,  time ,  etc 


-  They also need to assess the potential for errors resulting from the added complexity 


-  For example ,  in order to develop personalized prices ,  managers need to invest in advanced analytics and specialized personnel 


- 10 ,  Two additional factors worth mentioning are the products variable cost  the expense of raw materials and supplies ,  labor and so forth  and the cognitive cost required from customers by the pricing model 


-  The second ,  the cognitive cost to customers ,  is important because participating in the pricing decision requires effort ,  and this can demotivate customers and cause them to defer or abandon purchases 


-  Managers need to be aware of this possibility and understand how it can be mitigated 


-  ,  The case for leveraging customer input to capture  bigger share of the value created in the market is intuitive and compelling 


-  However ,  asking customers to weigh in on price can have benefits that go beyond promoting greater efficiency 


- 11 Asking customers to participate in  pricing decision is empowering ,  and empowerment can be associated with greater satisfaction 


-  When businesses set prices unilaterally ,  customers make  simple buy-not buy decision  ( Is the product worth the price? )  


-  If customers have  say about price ,  however ,  they have  greater incentive to determine what the product is actually worth to them ,  which is more demanding but also more engaging 


-  ,  Second ,  giving customers input on pricing provides an opportunity for customization 


-  When managers think of customization ,  they generally think of tailoring the products features to the buyers individual needs and wants 


-  In such contexts ,  the ability to customize price is attractive because it allows customers to say something specific and credible about their own abilities ,  resources and values 


-  ,  Third ,  customer input can be used to signal information about the company or the product 


-  Logos Bible Software ,   software company and electronic book publisher based in Bellingham ,  Washington ,  uses community pricing ,   variation on name-your-own-price ,  when considering some e-book projects 


-  Rather than setting  price ,  Logos lets customers propose what they would pay for the e-book if it is produced; when  group of customers offering to pay  given price results in enough projected revenue to make the project viable ,  Logos produces the e-book and all customers who bid that price or higher will receive it at that community price; later customers ,  however ,  will be charged more 


-  Finally ,  giving customers  voice on price has the potential to reduce competition 


-  If  company gives customers greater control of pricing ,  it effectively shifts competition to other dimensions ,  such as product quality and relationship management 


-  ,  Marketing departments pay  lot of attention to customer intimacy ,  and they rely heavily on research specialists to gather and analyze data on customer behavior and what competitors are doing 


-  However ,  the idea of getting customers involved in pricing is not  topic that is widely discussed 


-  In other settings ,  the idea of letting customers have sway over pricing seems irresponsible and dangerously counterproductive 


-  First ,  pricing is rarely considered an area where innovation is possible or even desirable 


-  Second ,  pricing conversations tend to be shrouded in secrecy ,  which makes reaching out to customers unlikely 


-  ,  The right kind of customer participation in pricing offers companies important advantages  particularly the ability to capture value and achieve greater differentiation 


-  In addition ,  it can increase customer engagement ,  broaden the scope for customization ,  signal  companys values or the quality of its product and relax competition 


-  Nevertheless ,  customer participation is not  case where more is better 


-  It requires managers to read their environment ,  carefully consider all the additional costs and then evaluate the options 


-  Working with customers to develop new pricing strategies offers one way for companies to create  new sense of excitement
