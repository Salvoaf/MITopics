-  Responding to competitive pressures and looking to improve operating profit margins ,   growing number of corporate managers are dismantling organizations and cultures that were built on selling particular products and replacing them with new structures designed to be more responsive to customer needs 


-  Rather than designing discrete chips and then assuming customers would adopt them ,  new units were expected to bundle whatever combinations of processes ,  chips and software made sense for their own customers 


-  )  The challenges of transforming product-centered cultures can be considerable 


-  ,  In the course of examining 15 companies that had attempted to reorganize themselves around customers ,  the reasons for the mixed results became clearer 


-  In fact ,  one of Mark Hurds first initiatives as the successor to Hewlett-Packard Co 


-  )  ,  The extent to which managers should attempt to transform their organizations toward customers depends on the thrust of the strategy and on the facilitating and countervailing pressures they need to balance 


-  ,  One of the main facilitators toward  more customer-focused organization is the strategic need to have  close relationship with customers 


- s Power Systems  need to interact closely with their customers in ways that go well beyond  traditional transactional relationship 


-  Conversely ,  companies with more homogeneous markets and more standardized offerings ,  and whose strategies are based on leveraging economies of scale ,  do not need to be as close to their customers 


-  The most they need to do is adopt informal coordination mechanisms 


-  For example ,  companies may not have enough detailed information about their customers or market segments; they may not want to get involved with the complexities of transfer pricing or activity-based costing; or there may be established legacy systems that will be difficult to change 


-  These countervailing pressures are  warning that although moving toward closer alignment with customers may be directionally correct ,  the appropriate structure needs to be shaped as much by the implementation constraints as by the strategic imperative to get closer to customers 


-  Still ,  managers at these companies were able to identify promising signs of progress ,  using metrics about customer satisfaction ,  customer perceptions of responsiveness and data showing better utilization of marketing resources 


-  ,  Different companies are pushed to reorganize for different reasons 


-  Zander wanted to abandon the divisional structure based on products  ( for example ,  mobile phones or broadband gear )  and reorganize the company around customer groups  ( such as digital products for home users or for large enterprises )  


-  To soften resistance within the company ,  Zander made internal cooperation  key factor in determining pay raises and bonuses 


-  ,  There was broad agreement among respondents that there needed to be  compelling strategic rationale for  realignment around markets before an organization could summon the energy necessary to carry it out 


-  The path to competitive advantage had to be clear ,  the reasons  ( or triggers )  had to be obvious and implementers needed to be able to see how and where they could contribute 


-  ,  Managers cited  number of primary and secondary reasons to explain the strategic rationales for their realignment efforts 


-  )  ,  The desire to implement  solutions strategy was the most frequently cited strategic rationale 


-  Many managers wanted the opportunity to work closely with customers to design tailored solutions that integrated both products and services and entailed some degree of risk sharing 


-  ,  which manufactures and sells  variety of engines and generators in East Asia ,  offers  good example 


-  The motivation to change was driven by two main factors: fear of losing its dominant market share and deteriorating profit margins as the Indian economy opened to foreign competition 


-  The service business taught the company about ongoing customer needs and showed managers that the margins on custom service bundles were better than those on products 


-  After all ,  power system customers were buying more than engines  they needed uninterrupted power and reliable end-to-end solutions 


-  ,  Solutions strategies are best suited to financial service companies or system manufacturers that can add  valuable service wrapper to their products or to companies that are operating in markets that are converging 


-  )  ,  While few managers cited getting closer to the market as the main reason for realigning ,  the advantages of getting closer to customers ,  gaining deeper insights into segments and breaking away from product orientation were often mentioned as strong supporting reasons 


-  Even though the company did not sell directly ,  management realigned the organization around four end-user segments: personal storage ,  entry level ,  midrange and enterprise 


-  ,  Imation created  business team for each end-user segment ,  led by product managers whose task was to assess customer requirements and design the offering 


-  ,  and large original equipment manufacturer accounts 


-  By bundling products to expand their positions within targeted segments ,  they wanted to follow the maxim ,  If you have dominant share in the market ,  make the sandbox bigger 


-  ,  Managers attempting to reorganize around customers need to understand the potential risks 


-  For example ,   companys eagerness to contain overhead costs may conflict with its desire to improve coordination and information sharing across the organization 


-  People who are fearful of change or who think they have something to lose often will latch on to these concerns 


-  ,  To overcome resistance ,  managers need to communicate actively and effectively 


-  ,  An important factor in getting people to pay attention to the customer experience is properly selecting performance metrics 


-  The choice of metrics needs to be guided by both strategy and objectives 


-  Team members general information needs to be augmented by metrics that illuminate the companys specific strategy and have  clear connection to financial performance 


-  In addition to supporting strategy ,  the best metrics are meaningful to employees and are grounded in  deep understanding of customer needs and priorities 


-  For example ,  GE Plastics found that on-time delivery was of paramount importance to its customers and that variability  being either late or early  was  major source of dissatisfaction 


-  To fulfill customer needs ,  the company began to measure and manage the delivery span  ( the time variation from the promised date )  by tying incentives to meeting designated dates 


-  ,  Management needs to keep in mind that employees will be reluctant to get on board unless they can trust the metrics and their ability to affect the results 


- 13 That kind of gaming compromises the potential value of the metric and shifts the focus from the needs of the customer 


-  Sometimes changes in corporate leadership interfere with the sense of urgency 


- &mldr; But that means our salespeople need to understand the customers business ,  what the customers real needs are and how the customer is going to use our products 


-  in April 1999 as the new CEO ,  he saw the need for  different configuration 


-  In his view ,  the sales force needed to be less geographically organized and more oriented toward selling document solutions 


-  ,  Due to implementation problems ,  none of the benefits of reorganization were realized 


-  In some market segments ,  employees were not committed to selling document solutions ,  and not all customers wanted solutions 


-  Among them: that the sales force owns the customers or that customers dont know what they want 


-  Companies need to design strategies for dealing with these issues early to avoid jeopardizing the whole program 


-  ,  Organizations that focus on the customer dimension need to think about which customer to serve 


-  Do you want  high share of  few accounts ,  or  smaller share of  large number of accounts? Assuming that the roster of high-value accounts keeps changing ,  companies must be prepared to form and re-form their account teams as new segment opportunities emerge 


-  Management also found that some customers didnt really want  closely linked collaborative relationship that functioned like  joint venture 


-  ,  Companies looking to stay aligned with the market need to be responsive to both customer opportunities and competitive cost pressures 


-  In tough economic times ,  cost considerations may need to take the upper hand 


-  ,  for example ,  part of Schneider Electric SA and  maker of industrial control and distribution systems ,  was organized around its main markets ,  which included industrial ,  residential and construction ,  to serve global customers that wanted integrated solutions 


-  The customer-focused structure ,  supported by centralized manufacturing ,  worked well for several years ,  but it ran into trouble when the economy slowed and customers started moving production overseas for lower costs 


- 15 Each line of business developed ,  manufactured and sold its own customized networking solutions to distinct customer segments: Internet service providers ,  large companies and small to midsize businesses 


- 16 Meanwhile ,  the previously distinct customer segments were converging with regard to their technological sophistication and requirements ,  and companies such as Huawei Technologies Co 


-  Customer satisfaction remained high ,  and in 2003 ,  net income rose to $3 


-  When companies rethink or redirect their strategies ,  they are also redesigning their enabling structures and supporting mechanisms to achieve better results 


-  In each case ,  the ability to regroup was enhanced by the fact that the company had existing market-driven cultures
