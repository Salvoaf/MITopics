- When the weather is hot ,  7-Eleven Japans stores in Tokyo have plenty of bento boxes Japans cold boxed meals of rice ,  pickles and other foodstuffs  while on cold days there are lots of hot noodles for sale 


-  The stores operators always seem to have plenty of what their customers want; in fact ,  they order and receive fresh food deliveries three times  day 


-  It is no coincidence that the company is the nations most profitable retailer 


-  At least twice  week ,  every one of its 10 , 000-plus mostly franchised stores gets  visit from  7- Eleven Japan counselor 


-  The counselor works with the store manager or franchisee to improve the business ,  often by using data from the stores information systems to manage and order more effectively 


-  ,  By matching local practices and preferences to IT investments ,  the store can continually introduce and succeed with new product lines 


-  The typical store adds 70% new items for sale each year ,   higher rate than that of any other retailer in Japan ,  which helped double its average stores daily sales from 1977 to 2004 


-  The store managers regularly receive graphical data showing recent sales ,  weather conditions and product range information ,  so they always know just how many bento boxes to order 


-  ,  7-Eleven Japan makes effective IT investments and manages an IT portfolio that constantly matches its business strategy 


-  But the companys well-managed IT investments are only part of the story behind its 20-year track record of industry-leading financial returns 


-  The convenience-store giant blends its IT investments with  range of assertive IT practices and capabilities everything from the counselors visits that increase the store operators IT skills to the transparency of an information infrastructure that links 70 , 000 computers in stores ,  at headquarters and at supplier sites 


-  ,   primary objective of this article is to show that IT investments alone ,  even using the much-heralded IT portfolio approach ,  cannot by themselves ensure that all key business goals are met 


-  )  For example ,  for each dollar invested in IT infrastructure ,  companies with high IT savvy have higher net profits in the year after the investment than does the average company 


-  Those with low IT savvy have ,  on the other hand ,  substantially lower net profits in the following year  ( controlling for many other factors )  


-  But in our work at MITs Center for Information Systems Research ,  we have developed  definition that describes the core attributes while preserving the street smarts sense of the term 


-  To us  and in conversation with the business executives with whom we work regularly  IT savvy refers to the planned ,  ongoing use of  set of interlocking business practices and competencies that collectively derive superior value from IT investments 


-  For companies like 7-Eleven Japan ,  IT savvy is ingrained ,  informing almost all of the companys business decisions and sharply focusing its IT investments 


-  The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of IT savvy in order to reframe the discussion about the business value of IT 


-  ,  Just as investors address their objectives for risk and return using portfolios of financial investments ,  some companies use IT portfolio management to better enable their management teams to match IT investments to strategic objectives 


-  Successful IT portfolio techniques change the conversation from technical to strategic considerations by applying  commercial lens to IT investments; the result is an allocation of IT assets that is appropriate for the companys circumstances 


-  Transactional investments are used primarily to cut costs or increase throughput for the same cost  ( for example ,  think of  brokerage firms trade processing system )  


-  Strategic investments are used to gain competitive advantage by supporting entry into new markets or by helping to develop new products ,  services or business processes  ( ATMs were  successful strategic IT initiative for the first banks that introduced them but they became transactional over time )  


-  And infrastructure investments are the shared IT services used by multiple applications  ( such as ,  servers ,  networks ,  laptops ,  customer databases )  


-  Depending on the service ,  infrastructure investments are typically aimed at providing  flexible base for future business initiatives or reducing long-term IT costs via consolidation 


-  In the same way that any personal investment portfolio must weigh stocks ,  bonds ,  cash and other financial assets against personal goals ,  an IT portfolio must be balanced  and regularly rebalanced  so that it is constantly aligned with business strategy and provides the appropriate combination of short- and long-term payoff 


-  It is senior managements job to balance the IT portfolio ,  and to integrate these disciplines into the companys IT governance processes 


-  ,  The average company studied in 2005 allocates 46% of its total IT investment to infrastructure 


-  Conceptually ,  informational and strategic systems sit on top of and use the transactional and infrastructure systems ,  absorbing 17% and 11% of average IT investment ,  respectively 


-  For example ,  the executives of  multibillion-dollar  


-  software and IT services company allocated  recent multimillion-dollar investment in  customer relationship management system this way: 60% informational ,  5% strategic ,  25% transactional and 10% infrastructure 


-  As  relatively late adopter of CRM ,  the IT services company expected few strategic benefits from the investment 


-  By contrast ,   competitor had successfully implemented CRM three years earlier with  higher total project cost and  different allocation of resources more strategic and less informational 


-  ,  Pharmaceuticals leader Eli Lilly and Company has used the portfolio approach since 1999 to categorize its IT investments 


-  We tend to want to have 5% [of our projects] in strategic areas ,  15% to 20% in the informational category ,  and the remaining percentage split between the infrastructure and transactional ,  explains Sheldon Ort ,  Lillys information officer for business operations 


-  ,  The technique is also engaging business leaders in IT investment decisions at Mohegan Sun ,  the Connecticut-based casino 


-  CIO Dan Garrow reflects on the experience: Comparing our strategy against our plans for expenditures in each of the four management objectives for investments ,  we realized there was  disconnect between our long-range plans and our resource allocations ,  both human and financial 


-  Portfolio thinking helped us bring the day-to-day activities back into alignment with our long-range objectives 


-  Portfolio thinking helps us determine what type of company we are and the level of risk were willing to take ,  particularly around our strategic business efforts 


-  ,  The portfolio allocation approach works because it underscores the importance of how organizations use technology instead of focusing on the technology itself 


-  Making  sensible asset allocation requires senior managers to be crystal clear about what they wish to achieve and about who will be held accountable  hardly the stuff of technical specifications 


-  ,  Each asset class is linked to different types of business value 


-  )  For example ,  companies that invest more heavily than their competitors in transactional IT have lower costs 


-  Transactional investments pay off by using IT to support or automate repetitive business processes 


-  offers  good example: The company uses IT effectively to cut business costs and increase productivity 


-  For instance ,  it provides free package tracking information on its Web site or integrated into its customers enterprise resource planning systems 


-  Before online tracking was offered ,  customer calls to the companys call center cost UPS about $2 each; sometimes there were two follow-on calls to locate the package ,  for  total of $6 for one inquiry 


-  Now each tracking request costs UPS only  few cents ,  even during the Christmas rush ,  when the company gets up to six million such requests  day 


-  For any company that is eager to use IT to cut costs and improve productivity ,  it makes sense to tilt its IT portfolio toward transactional investments 


-  For example ,  Van-guard 


-  Some are designed to cut costs through standardization and consolidation  data center consolidation ,  for instance 


-  Others reduce time to market for new business initiatives or provide  platform for delivering companywide initiatives such as  shared customer database for  single point of customer contact 


-  offers  good example of the value created by  shared IT infrastructure 


-  The $20 billion company is  leader in the marketing ,  hospitality and travel businesses; its most recognized brands include Radisson Hotels  Resorts ,   


-  Although the businesses are run autonomously ,  Carlson has captured cost savings and synergies with  world-class shared services capability ,  which won the 2004 International Productivity and Quality Councils award for the best mature shared services organization 


-  ,  Carlson Shared Services is set up to operate as  business ,  offering IT and financial services  ( with plans to offer more )  it is governed by  board comprising the CIOs and CFOs of the business units; and its IT organization provides 89 infrastructure services to Carlsons businesses 


-  The IT unit compares the prices of its services to those of external vendors ,  and outsources whenever  vendor can offer  better price or quality proposition than what internal IT resources can offer 


-  As  result ,  Carlsons business units use the shared IT services as much as possible ,  even though use is not mandatory 


-  ,  Although the top performers  ( defined as the top third in terms of industry-adjusted return on assets ,  net margins and revenue growth )  have IT portfolio allocations similar to the average companys ,  collectively they spend 4% more on IT as  percentage of net sales 


-  ,  But the differences within specific industries are striking 


-  For example ,  top performers in financial services spend 10% less on IT than the average financial firm but have portfolios more heavily weighted toward IT infrastructure 


-  ( In that sector ,  IT investment is so fundamental to business processes that IT systems are quite mature ,  with much of the advantage coming from higher efficiency in executing basic transactions and providing infrastructure to foster innovation 


-  )  By contrast ,  the top performers in wholesale ,  retail and transport sectors spend 11% more on IT than their average competitors and weight their portfolios more heavily toward informational assets ,  indicating that theres still competitive advantage in the effective use of information 


-  ,  Clearly ,  companies that link their IT investments to their business strategies are well-placed to outrun their competitors along desired performance dimensions 


-  Above-average management capabilities are also needed to achieve above-industry-average returns from those IT investments 


-  Our research assessed each companys relative IT savvy by cataloging companies practices ,  processes and capabilities 


-  )  ,  The returns from IT infrastructure  the largest IT asset class and often the most difficult to cost-justify in advance  strikingly illustrate the impact of IT savvy 


-  By contrast ,  companies with low IT savvy have ,  on average ,  $909 lower net profits the next year per dollar spent on infrastructure  controlling for industry ,  size and other investments such as research and development and advertising expenditures 


-  ,  IT infrastructure is the foundation of all IT investments ,  including the communications network ,  shared customer data ,  laptops ,  data centers and servers; it accounts for close to half of the average companys total IT spend 


-  High-IT-savvy companies turn these enabling investments into value much faster than do low-IT-savvy companies  in one year compared with three years or longer 


-  They achieve this premium by following particular practices more rigorously  for example ,  by ensuring that more of their business processes are digitized ,  and by more quickly designing and implementing changes to crucial business processes 


-  Thus ,  instead of having their infrastructure investments hit the bottom line only as acquisition costs ,  IT-savvy companies put them to work faster ,  registering improvement on the bottom line in the next year 


-  ,  Raytheon Company illustrates how IT infrastructure investments can deliver cost savings and provide  platform for business agility ,  and it shows how business processes and decision-making practices must change accordingly 


-  She explains that the practices guiding Raytheon to  standardized technology infrastructure after the mergers were just  first step in generating value from IT: ,  You will outgrow the governance model that makes you successful 


-  It took me  while to figure that out because we had developed  governance model that was so effective  everybody was so supportive of it 


-  It was  governance model that helped us consolidate and shape up the company 


-  Thats what we needed to do over the first three to four years of being the new company ,  because if you dont get the synergy of the merger ,  youre not going to come up for air ever 


-  ,  However ,  Rhoads found that ,  following Raytheons cost-cutting successes ,  the focus needed to shift to agility ,  to questions of how the company would grow and how IT enables that growth 


-  ,  High-IT-savvy companies also see higher performance associated with transactional IT investments used to automate repetitive transactions ,  cut costs and increase throughput 


-  Not only does Wall Street value such investments in high-IT-savvy companies ,  but also these companies have higher profits 


-  Interestingly ,  companies with more transactional IT investment also have more sales from new and modified products 


-  Paradoxically ,  in high-IT-savvy companies ,  process digitization enables innovative new products and services by freeing up managers to innovate on the platform of these digitized processes 


-  For example ,  Amazon 


-  ,  the quintessential IT-savvy company ,  can relatively easily try  new service such as tailored recommendations based on the consumers purchase history and on other customers reviews 


-  The new service requires only marginal investment on top of Amazons current digitized processes 


-  Better yet ,  the product can be offered to only  few target customers and the impact can be measured immediately 


-  ,  Strategic IT ,  with its objectives to create new business value or growth ,  is historically  high-risk ,  high-return asset class 


-  In such companies ,  business management involvement and  culture of IT use in business processes are necessary for more successful strategic  ( and in other companies ,  risky )  IT investment 


-  Companies with strong IT savvy demonstrate particularly strong profitability because of the disciplines required to use common sets of information effectively 


-  There is no impact from informational IT on innovation ,  cost or market capitalization in the average company 


-  The situation for these companies is bleak ,  with value leaking from most of their IT spending 


-  Otherwise ,  they will continue to leak value ,  particularly from the longer-term and higher-risk asset classes such as strategic IT 


-  ,  What are the hallmarks of the IT-savvy company? Companies with high IT savvy have developed the five mutually reinforcing characteristics described below 


-  The first three characteristics are practices related to IT use ,  and the last two are competencies needed for high IT savvy 


-  )  ,  IT for communication  extensive use of electronic channels such as e-mail ,  intranets and wireless devices for internal and external communications and work practices 


-  For example ,  7-Eleven Japans system connects 70 , 000 computers in stores ,  at headquarters and at supplier sites ,  providing transparency across the entire value chain 


-   salesman for one of the companys food suppliers put it this way: [Their] information system is so good that we can instantly find out which goods of ours are selling to what types of customers and how much 


-  The collaboration between 7-Eleven Japan and its partners includes shared information ,  information systems and know-how about operations management as well as quality control throughout the value chain 


-  ,  Internet use  more use of Internet architectures for key processes such as sales force management ,  employee performance measurement ,  training and post-sales customer support 


-  ,  Digital transactions   high degree of digitization of the companys repetitive transactions ,  particularly sales ,  customer interaction and purchasing 


-  The underpinning for 7-Eleven Japans digital capability is the network of 70 , 000 computers that collect data at the point of sale on every customer and every item sold 


-  Each days data is analyzed for use the next morning 


-  Other digitized processes allow each store to place orders and receive deliveries three times daily ,  with deliveries organized by temperature  frozen ,  refrigerated ,  ambient ,  etc 


-  ,  Companywide IT skills  the ability of almost all employees to use IT effectively 


-  There are strong technical and business skills among the IT staff ,  strong IT skills among the business staff and an adequate market supply of highly skilled IT staff 


-  7-Eleven Japan trains its 200 , 000 employees to use available point-of-sale data along with information on product ,  local weather forecasts and regional demographic and purchasing patterns so they can propose and quickly test hypotheses about the appeal of different types of products in each store 


-  ,  Constant management involvement  strong commitment of senior managers to effective IT use 


-  Business-unit managers are heavily involved in IT decisions ,  strengthening partnerships between IT staff and business units to help generate value from IT investments 


-  Putting it another way ,  the companies that focus on strengthening IT capabilities have developed the IT practices and companywide IT skills that complement investments in the four IT asset classes 


-  The strong commitment of senior management encourages more business-unit managers to become involved in IT decisions 


-  This in turn leads to more companywide IT skills via formal and informal education programs ,  along with more use of IT for communication ,  work practices and transaction digitization 


-  ,  The results of IT savvy are clearly observed when measuring process digitization 


-  On average ,  the 147 organizations we studied completed 19% of their sales and 23% of their purchases electronically; there was little variation across industries 


-  However ,  the third of companies with the most digitized processes completed 50% of their sales and 55% of their purchases electronically 


-  ,  Our research identifies the returns on different types of IT investments for the average company ,  and demonstrates that even higher returns are available by matching IT-savvy practices and competencies with the IT portfolio 


-  But how can managers work to match IT savvy with the IT asset mix? Here are seven suggestions based on the experiences of the top performers: ,  Using our portfolio categorization ,  estimate your companys IT portfolios for the last three years and the proposed IT portfolio for next year 


- 10 At an IT investment committee or governance meeting ,  discuss whether these investments are appropriate for the companys business strategy 


-   recent discussion with an insurance company ,  looking back over the last four years of IT portfolios ,  raised these important questions: ,  By answering these questions ,  the insurer reconsidered its IT investment process and began increasing the IT savvy of the whole organization  starting at the top 


-  ,  Using the results reported in this article and other benchmarks ,  assess whether your current IT portfolios are appropriate for your companys or business units strategic goals ,  IT savvy and appetite for risk 


-  An attractive alternative to using benchmarks is to compare multiple business units in your company 


-  Since each business unit has  different strategy and IT savvy ,  comparisons of the alignment of their objectives ,  practices ,  capabilities and IT portfolios will help highlight where IT investments are applied thoughtfully and what changes should be considered 


-  Again ,  its informative to compare IT savvy across multiple business units 


-  Companies or business units with low overall IT savvy should consider re-weighting their IT portfolios toward the less risky transactional and informational investments 


-  )  To improve IT savvy ,  start with characteristics that provide leverage for the most important asset classes in the companys or business units IT portfolio 


-  Practices from strong IT-savvy business units can be codified and transferred to those with less IT savvy 


-  ,  Using the results from the previous three steps ,  senior management must make judgments about the companys IT portfolio 


-  The judgments are based on managements intuition concerning strategy ,  appetite for risk ,  the companys IT savvy ,  the economy ,  available capital ,  etc 


-  Having an IT portfolio process makes this judgment explicit and trackable over time instead of hidden within the budgets of each project or department 


-  ,  Like personal investments ,  IT portfolios need to be re-weighted as business and economic circumstances change 


-  For example ,  as companies achieve high overall IT-savvy ratings ,  they can invest more in IT and assume more risk  ( such as increase strategic or infrastructure investments )  in their portfolios relative to competitors or to previous investments 


-  ,  Effective IT governance specifies the decision rights and accountability framework to ensure that IT is applied in the right ways 


-  IT investment is one of the key IT decisions that needs to be governed 


-  Effective governance institutionalizes the disciplines of IT investment  ( often incorporating IT portfolio management )  in  repeatable process that is understood and followed by all managers and linked to the companys incentive and reward systems 


-  The shorter the time lag ,  the greater the number of opportunities to learn 


-  Tracking the impact of IT investment decisions and using these results to inform the next cycle of IT investment promotes enterprise learning  the faster the better 


-  Growing numbers of companies now include in their project budgets an allocation for development of people that includes education ,  training and post-implementation reviews  ( or even in-process implementation reviews )  


-  They are not meant to be  step-by-step how-to for overhauling the IT strategies of large ,  complex organizations ,  nor are they meant to provide  new organization blueprint for the IT-savvy company 


-  ,  Clearly ,  there are myriad pressing issues clamoring for the attention of the top management team 


-  In our experience ,  companies with average or low IT savvy can significantly increase their returns and reduce their IT risk without investing another cent in technology 


-  That should be reason enough for many business leaders to elevate the issue 


-  ,  More fundamentally ,  though ,  the story of IT savvy is  story of untapped potential  of money left on the table ,  and of competitors who can grab  lasting advantage 


-  In  time of unrelenting competition from all corners of the globe ,  managers must understand the consequences of not acting to enrich their organizations IT savvy
