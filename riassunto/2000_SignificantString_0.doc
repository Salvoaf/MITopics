-  ,  Companies ,  such as these banks ,  are still struggling to understand how to put information to work so that it improves business performance 


-  Two information-based management disciplines  the information-technology field and the information-management field ,  which involve librarians ,  records managers and Web-site content managers  have put more emphasis on creating systems and processes to store or classify information than on improving the way people behave with information 


-  ,  Is this notion right? How does the interaction of people ,  information and technology affect business performance? These questions led  team of 10 researchers and staff from the International Institute for Management Development ,  sponsored by Andersen Consulting ,  to conduct  2-1/2year international research effort to understand how senior managers perceive the relationship between business performance and three information capabilities  IT ,  information management ,  and peoples behaviors and values pertaining to the use of information 


-  The result was different IT practices  ( ITP )  ,  information-management practices  ( IMP )  and information behaviors and values  ( IBV )  


-  Information technology for innovation-support applications allows customization ,  tracking of potential new customers and identification of internal business opportunities 


-  Information gathered through these applications is fed into existing management-support systems to speed new product development and future strategy formulation 


-  ,  Most importantly ,  the customer support system provides flexible decision-making support at all levels of the company 


-  Managers can actively monitor on  daily and monthly basis changes in customer base ,  product sales ,  business-performance goals ,  risk assessments and customer buying behavior 


-  Product managers had inadequate decision-making tools and suffered from information overload 


-  Companies with high levels of IO understand this 


-  ,  For example ,  at Bank  ,  IT applications that are considered essential to compete are kept in-house and implemented by the most talented and experienced IT staff 


-  Its IT model is considered one of its strongest capabilities and is now being exported and replicated by numerous global strategic partners 


-  Bank  has also recently developed an Internet channel ,  but it faces considerable customer-service challenges because telephone ,  branch and Internet interfaces remain incompatible 


-  ,  The IO model identifies five separate phases of information-management practices: sensing ,  collecting ,  organizing ,  processing and maintaining 


-  Bank  and Bank  show marked differences in rankings Bank  excels at information-management practices  ( 99% )  ,  while Bank  is ranked at only 45% 


-  Branch representatives are taught how to record their observations about customer demands for new products in the customer-support system  ( putting the banks relative ranking at 50% )  


-  Good sensing and information-valuation and information-processing practices are critical elements of the high-IO company 


-  The following guidelines can help managers think about how to move their companies toward better information-management practices 


-  High-IO companies ,  like Bank  ,  understand the importance of each of these practices and know that inadequate attention to one practice can disrupt the cycle 


-  ,  People can sense information effectively only when they understand what drives  companys business performance and how they personally can help to improve performance 


-   company that provides information to employees to help them understand not only what they are doing ,  but also why they are doing it ,  is better able to focus on relevant business information 


-  Sensing is enhanced and information-valuation assessments become more precise 


-  The rankings are similar to Bank As high IT practice and information-management practice rankings ,  while Bank Bs information behaviors and values rank is 44% 


-  These gaps in peoples mind-sets and behaviors  when coupled with additional deficiencies in information-management practices and IT practices  may result in lower business performance 


-  ,  The integrity of information is especially important to ensure that people use and improve the formal customer-support system  ( 87% )  


-  ,  Managers at Bank  are also convinced that in  working environment in which people understand how individual and team performance relates to company performance ,  people are more likely to share and use information in ways that benefit others 


-  Bank  not only trains people for this behavior ,  but also understands that the cumulative effect of high integrity ,  formality ,  control ,  transparency and sharing the right attitude is  proactive workforce able to respond quickly to customer needs and to think about how to use company information to create or enhance products and services 


-  ,  Changing mind-sets ,  behaviors and values is never easy 


-  To undertake the journey ,  you will have to develop the right mind-set about effective information use in your business
