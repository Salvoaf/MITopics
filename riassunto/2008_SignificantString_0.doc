-  Big company managers know how hard it is for market leaders to create innovative growth businesses 


-  They argue that companies should begin planning for innovation well before they need to by appointing  senior manager to oversee the resource-allocation process ,  creating  team of movers and shapers ,  and training employees to identify disruptive ideas 


-  )  Companies that create blueprints for growth ,  construct innovation engines and support the engines with the right systems and mind-sets can establish favorable conditions for substantial innovation 


-  ,  The first pillar of creating the capability to build new business involves articulating what the organization wants to be and allocating resources to achieve that vision 


-  ,  Business leaders are often skeptical about the notion of defining strategic goals and boundaries ,  believing that their strategy is already well defined and broadly known 


-  Or they will argue that removing boundaries is the best way to allow managers to identify opportunities or create new growth 


-  However ,  it is helpful for senior management to come to consensus around two topics: the strategic objectives and the specific options they will and will not consider to reach those objectives 


-  ,  The first part of the discussion involves articulating the desired outcome of the companys innovation efforts and where it expects to find growth 


-  Company executives estimated how much growth they expected from its core and from products in its development pipeline ,  and they were shocked at what they learned: Even under the most optimistic scenarios ,  it still needed to generate almost  billion dollars in new growth to meet its 10-year strategic objectives 


-  Before the exercise ,  leaders had  vague sense that innovation was important 


-  The insight helped magnify the innovation challenge and rally key managers around the need to approach innovation differently 


-  ,  The second part of the discussion determines which strategies the company will  and will not  consider following in order to reach its growth objectives 


-  Companies need to have consensus around what is desirable ,  discussable and unthinkable along  number of strategic dimensions 


-  The classic question of What business are you in? can prompt very different and sometimes contradictory answers from members of the same management team 


-  Some leaders of  large chemical company ,  for example ,  saw the company as  specialty business ,  while others thought of themselves as raw materials suppliers for downstream value-adding industries 


-  Managers frequently believe that letting chaos reign can unleash their companys innovative energy 


-  Yet companies often come to realize that having  blank slate can make it surprisingly hard for managers 


-  Innovators who know what  company wants to do  ( the goals )  and what it wont do  ( the boundaries )  can focus their creative efforts 


-  ,  Good investors know the value of aligning their portfolio with their investment objectives 


-  Ironically ,  organizations often find that their allocation of resources doesnt match their intended strategies 


-  While theres no magic formula for what the ideal portfolio should look like ,   50/30/20 split  ( targeting core improvements ,  logical extensions of the core business and new growth initiatives )  can be  reasonable approach 


-  Companies need to allocate resources appropriately toward the different types of innovation 


-  Therefore ,  companies need to make sure that they set aside resources  both people and dollars  for different types of innovation initiatives in  manner that is consistent with their strategic objectives 


-  In fact ,  its dangerous to invest too much capital too early 


- s famous 15% rule encouraging scientists to spend up to 15% of their time on projects they find personally interesting ,  we believe that companies seeking to create innovative businesses will do better allocating  few people fully than many people partially 


-  In the short run ,  this may make perfect sense; in the long run ,  it can be disastrous 


-  ,  This temptation is one reason why it is important to keep the core business as healthy as possible 


-  In fact ,  the best time to start investing in new growth businesses is when the company seemingly doesnt need it 


-  This doesnt make much sense 


-  ,  Generally speaking ,  new growth initiatives need to go through  more iterative development process ,  where the focus is on identifying and addressing the key assumptions and risks 


-  The appropriate metrics that guide  new growth idea shouldnt be measures such as net present value or return on investment ,  which provide insights into the performance of the established core business; rather ,  companies need to use qualitative measures that relate to success in the target market 


-  The weight of historical evidence suggests that businesses that are disruptive to their core business need  great deal of organizational autonomy 


-   salesperson trained in the ways of the core business might rely too heavily on customers he knows instead of the new customers hell need to cultivate to make the business work 


-  Managers who want to submit ideas complete idea resumes that provide  basic overview of the idea ,  the reason why the idea is worth funding and the critical assumptions that need to be addressed 


-   If we fail ,  we want to make sure everyone learns from our missteps 


-  And when we succeed ,  we want to ensure that all of our papers can leverage that success 


-   We dont think we have all the answers ,  not by  long shot 


-  But we believe were heading in the right direction 


-   systematic ability to innovate and grow needs support from the companys very top managers 


-  In addition ,  senior management needs to change the way it interacts with project teams 


-  But when  company commits to  new direction ,  senior managers need to become problem solvers ,  not just problem finders 


-  ,   useful way to think of senior managements role in supporting growth initiatives is to think about the distinction between television watching and working on  computer: Watching television typically involves leaning back to watch ,  while using  computer involves leaning forward to interact 


-  These traps include pursuing perfection when good enough is often sufficient ,  overestimating knowledge of new markets and making big bets when its better to begin with small ones 


-  ,  Both senior managers and middle managers need to overcome these mindsets 


-  Well-intentioned middle managers who do what they have always done can default to core behavior when fresh thinking is required 


-   senior manager who doesnt get it can destroy  highly innovative approach by asking the wrong questions at the wrong time 


-  ,  Language played  major role in one of the best-known examples of market disruption: Intel Corp 


-  Intel subsequently launched what became known as the Celeron processor ,   stripped-down ,  low-cost chip to compete in the least-demanding tiers in its industry 


- 10 ,  Christensen believes that education played  critical role in helping Intel formulate and execute its response to the competitive threat 


-  He said ,  You know ,  the model didnt give us any answers to any of the problems ,  but it gave us  common language and  common way to frame the problem so that we could reach consensus around counterintuitive courses of action 


-  In the last five years ,  companies have begun to realize the power of what Henry  


- 12 ,  Generally speaking ,  companies need to find ways to bring external perspectives into the innovation process 


-  Companies need to redesign their policies ,  incentives and development paths to be consistent with their appetite for innovation 


-  Instead of looking for right-stuff managers who have succeeded in core assignments ,  they need to look for managers who have attended the right schools of experience so they can spot and nurture new growth businesses 


-  Companies need to find  way to link managed risk taking with pay structures ,  bonuses and/or career progression 


-  ,  Companies need to design development paths that encourage high-potential employees to spend time working for growth initiatives 


-  ,  As companies develop HR structures to help them reach their innovation goals ,  they need to consider how they can offer promising employees the broadest possible exposure to new ways of problem solving and decision making
