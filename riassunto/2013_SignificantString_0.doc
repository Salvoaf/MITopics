-  How can companies tap into this distributed knowledge and these diverse skills? Increasingly ,  organizations are considering using an open-innovation process ,  but many are finding that making open innovation work can be more complicated than it looks 


-  ( The company instead asked consumers to choose among six other names 


-  Specifically ,  they had to determine  (  )  whether to open the idea-generation process;  (  )  whether to open the idea-selection process; or  (  )  whether to open both 


-  ,  Most managers who have heard of the potential to open the idea-generation process know one of the advantages: the sheer number of ideas that become available 


-   second ,  lesser-known advantage of open innovation is that the value of the best idea generally increases with the variability of the ideas received 


-  Yet opening the idea-selection process can also generate significant value 


-  As such ,  skilled and active users are well-positioned to evaluate new ideas  after all ,  they understand better than anyone whats needed to perform specialized maneuvers or tricks 


-  ,  When picking an open-innovation strategy ,  managers must choose whether to open the idea-generation process ,  the idea-selection process or both 


-   subsequent analysis of the proposals revealed that much of the knowledge content went beyond what would have occurred in the traditional academic discipline of diabetes 


-  ,  Managers tend to discount the advantages of open innovation for two main reasons 


-  Second ,  they tend to think that open innovation doesnt work on anything but very narrow technical problems 


-  Indeed ,  throughout the contest ,  rivals were freely sharing knowledge and often merging into new teams of competitors 


-  ,  Nobel Prize laureate Kenneth Arrow argued that the value of an idea cannot be assessed unless it is revealed 


-  Johnson  Son ,  for example ,  the company known for such household products as Glade air fresheners ,  Kiwi shoe polish and OFF! insect repellent ,  has worked diligently to establish itself as an honest buyer of external ideas and thus has succeeded in attracting good ideas from outsiders 


-  Inventors know that InnoCentive has every incentive to ensure that ideas arent misappropriated; its business model depends on having  reputation for handling contests effectively and honestly 


-  Because innovation contests generally work best with  healthy number of contributors ,  companies should consider implementing mechanisms for lowering the investment cost of participation 


-  One challenge NASA asked people to solve was how to build  laundry system for the International Space Station 


-  ,  As we have noted ,  managers are less familiar with the option of opening the idea-selection process to outsiders 


-  Such approaches commonly take the form of approval contests  think of the TV shows American Idol and The Voice ,  in which outsiders vote to determine which entries should be pursued 


- com in 2006 ,  asks customers to heart products and then aggregates the data to create personalized boutiques 


-  LEGO Group ,  the Danish toy company ,  asks consumers to vote on which landmark buildings it should feature in future architectural model kits 


-  More recently ,  Wal-Mart has asked its customers to vote on new products it should carry online or on its retail shelves 


-  In making the choices ,  Threadless executives weigh three factors: scores from outside selectors ,  score distribution  ( which indicates fan intensity )  and their own sense of fashion aesthetics and style trends 


-  This residual control allows Threadless executives and managers to reject designs they consider inappropriate ,  offensive or redundant 


-  The goal is to balance freedom of expression and the desire for honest feedback with the civility and respect that is necessary to encourage participation 


-  ,  Some organizations ,  particularly those focused on products where needs change quickly ,  have opened both the idea-generation and -selection parts of the innovation process 


-  ,  Managers seeking to open both the idea-generation and -selection parts of the innovation process must confront the problems noted earlier 


-  They also must address what is potentially  more fundamental problem: How to make money? Traditionally ,  most companies have relied on proprietary knowledge as  major barrier to entry for competitors 


-  They appropriated value from innovations by keeping them secret ,  or they made money by having  superior understanding of customer needs 


-  However ,  when these activities are managed outside the organization ,  what is the role of the company ,  and how can it make money? ,  One successful approach is for companies to reconsider what they actually do 


-  In working through these steps ,  managers should ask themselves  series of questions 


-  First ,  they should consider whether outside innovators are likely to have access to unique knowledge that might be able to generate  plausible solution to an innovation problem 


-  Is the knowledge needed to solve an innovation problem concentrated within  few individuals or teams ,  or is it broadly dispersed? The more dispersed the skills or the more uncertainty about what skills are needed ,  the more valuable opening the idea-generation part of innovation will be 


-  ,  Once managers have considered whether outsiders are likely to have better ideas ,  they should consider whether they can attract outsiders to provide these ideas 


-  As we discussed ,  if innovation requires considerable investment by the solver ,  the number of external people willing to participate in  companys innovation program will be limited 


-  If managers conclude that outside innovators have valuable ideas and can be attracted to participate ,  then they know that they should consider opening the idea-generation process by either developing design tournaments or creating design communities 


-  ,  After considering the idea-generation side of open innovation ,  managers should consider the selection side 


-  Do outside selectors have unique knowledge about customer needs? Are these needs changing rapidly? Are specific skills required to select the right innovation? If so ,  outside selectors may be helpful in choosing the best innovations 


-  Once managers have concluded that an outside perspective is useful ,  they should ask themselves whether they can align the incentives of the outside selectors with the companys goals 


-  ,  If the above analysis convinces  manager that he or she should open both idea generation and selection ,  one last question remains: How does the business still make money? Secret knowledge is often  critical barrier to entry for competitors and thus  critical condition for companies to be profitable 


-  The key to success is careful consideration of what to open ,  how to open it and how to manage the new problems created by that openness
