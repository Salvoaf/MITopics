- Two years ago ,  in an interview called The Four Ways IT Is Revolutionizing Innovation ,  Erik Brynjolfsson ,  the Schussel Family Professor of Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management ,  told MIT Sloan Management Review how he saw information technology transforming the way companies do business by ,  among other things ,  giving companies radically improved measurement capabilities through what he called nano data 


-  As Brynjolfsson explained: ,  What Brynjolfsson described is indeed coming to pass 


-  In this issue of MIT Sloan Management Review ,  were featuring  number of articles about how companies can put all that data to use to better manage their businesses 


-  Bell ,  Jeonghye Choi and Leonard Lodish offer some surprising insights about how to grow online sales  insights gleaned from studying sales data from e-commerce companies 


-  Kumar and Rohan Mirchandani explain how Hokey Pokey ,  an entrepreneurial ice-cream retailer in India ,  analyzed social media data to develop  more effective approach to social media marketing 


-  ,  Then ,  in Innovating With Analytics ,  David Kiron ,  Pamela Kirk Prentice and Renee Boucher Ferguson describe some new survey results that suggest that analytics is helping companies innovate  and is also shifting the power structure within some organizations 


-  Davenport ,  Paul Barth and Randy Bean explain three important aspects of big data and how it differs from traditional analytics 


-  And ,  lest we get overly enamored with what we can do with data ,  Ritu Agarwal and Peter Weill make the point that data analytics and optimization will only take companies so far 


-  In their article The Benefits of Combining Data With Empathy ,  Agarwal and Weill argue for an approach that instead integrates three important capabilities: the ability to optimize business processes and technology ,  the ability to foster emotional connections and the ability to use data empathically

- One hallmark of  successful company is that it stands out from the crowd 


-  Perhaps its approach to customer service is groundbreaking ,  the opportunities it offers its employees more exciting or its products just cooler than the competitors 


-  ,  What enables some companies to be consistently and resolutely different? Business writers have pointed to such attributes as visionary leadership ,   unique corporate culture and  distinctive set of core competencies 


-  Although there is little doubt that such elements can sometimes play  key role ,  we argue that ,  in the end ,   companys beliefs  or what we refer to as its uncommon sense  are often the most critical source of differentiation 


-  Peter Druckers theory of the business focuses on the underlying beliefs held by the organizations leaders about what the business does 


-  Yet while many recognize that beliefs form the platform for actions and capabilities ,  its less clear how managers can apply this insight 


-  Research in this area has tended to focus ,  for example ,  on how competing businesses converge on the same set of beliefs or industry recipes over time ,  or how  companys dominant logic locks it into  narrow way of thinking about its business opportunities 


-  Our approach ,  by contrast ,  is to show how managers can generate  distinctive belief system  their uncommon sense  and translate it into action 


-  ,  Good strategies start from  distinctive point of view: for example ,  an insight into evolving customer needs or about how the world is changing 


-  However ,  few companies manage to develop original strategies by formulating hypotheses and then testing them out in  competitive setting 


-  Instead ,  many deploy frameworks and models from the strategists toolbox  industry analysis ,  market segmentation ,  benchmarking and outsourcing 


-  By jumping straight to generic game plans  ( such as cost leadership ,  total quality or product innovation )  ,  companies short-circuit the real work of strategy and miss out on finding new insights into the preferences or behaviors of current or potential customers 


-  ,  In its purest form ,   distinctive belief system manifests itself in  blue ocean strategy   market position in which the business has no obvious competitors 


-  If the bottom of the food chain in strategy is competing for share of  commodity market  ( where price is the only real differentiator )  ,  then the top of the food chain is inventing  market where the uniqueness of ones offering is protected by seemingly insurmountable barriers to competition 


-  ,  Sam Walton famously credited Wal-Marts success to  single heretical assumption: that there was an unrecognized opportunity in placing good-size discount stores into little one-horse towns that everybody else was ignoring 


-  Other examples of blue-ocean thinking can be found in the strategic innovations of Cirque de Soleil ,  which blended the artistry of  live circus with the refinement of  Broadway production ,  and Southwest Airlines ,  which developed  fresh new model for low-cost ,  no-frills air travel 


-  We have conducted research on corporate distinctiveness for five years ,  and in most cases distinctiveness manifests itself in smaller ways 


-  )  For example ,  HCL Technologies ,  an IT services company ,  based in Noida ,  India ,  has found that by putting employees first ,  customers second it can generate greater value in its customer relationships than its competitors 


-  Such beliefs may not result in the creation of entirely new lines of business ,  but they have  pervasive influence on the way employees behave 


-  It goes beyond the more conventional notions of market positioning and product differentiation because it works at the level of beliefs rather than just actions or capabilities 


-  As  result ,  it is woven into the fabric of the organization and its vision of itself 


-  In business ,  it implies that success flows to organizations that authentically operate idiosyncratic ,  self-discovered and coherent belief systems 


-  Beliefs can take many forms ,  but the three most important ones are: ,  Within  given industry ,  all companies  ( even the most idiosyncratic ones )  share many of the same beliefs and assumptions 


-  ,  Not all of  companys beliefs are actually true 


-  To be wealth-creating ,  the truth content of  companys belief system must be greater than that of its competitors 


-  In our words ,  winning strategies exhibit uncommon sense: sense because they are true ,  and uncommon because they are proprietary to the winning company 


-  The winner knows something that competitors do not know 


-  Using the same logic ,  common sense is the set of true beliefs that are shared by competitors; common nonsense is the set of false beliefs shared by competitors; and uncommon nonsense is the set of distinctive beliefs held by one company that are actually not true  ( See Types of Beliefs in an Industry 


-  Whats more ,  propositions that may once have been true almost always become less true or even false over time 


-  Market tastes and preferences change 


-  Technology makes new things possible 


-  ,  Managing  business is  journey of discovery ,  uncovering falsehoods and formulating new hypotheses 


-  Built on Ingvar Kamprads belief that he could create  better everyday life for the many people by providing affordable ,  good-quality furniture ,  the company grew internationally in the late 1960s and early 1970s by replicating what worked in Sweden 


-  However ,  Kamprad and his colleagues didnt fully understand which parts of their offering people actually cared about: Was it the expansive and customer-friendly showrooms? Was it the low prices and the products requiring relatively easy assembly? Was it the quirky Swedish product names and blue-and-yellow branding? Ikeas repeated success in new markets it entered made executives wary of changing any part of the original formula 


-  It was only when the company experienced problems in Japan and the United States that executives undertook to sort out the truths and falsehoods and create  more flexible business approach 


-  ,  Our approach provides an analytical tool that allows strategy making to become more systematic and coherent 


-  However ,  there are ways of generating better ideas for enhancing your distinctiveness ,  and there are also ways of testing out those ideas in an organized fashion 


-  ,  Discovering The goal of discovering is to create new value for the company by expanding its uncommon sense  adding  dimension to the companys offering that competitors dont have 


-  Metro International is one such example 


-  In 1995 ,  it launched the first free mass-market newspaper in Stockholm 


-  Despite widespread skepticism from competitors and industry observers ,  the newspaper managed to generate enough advertising revenue to become profitable 


-  ,  Like Metro ,  Petrofac ,   fast-growing oil services company that operates extensively in the Middle East ,  has built its success by following  distinctive set of beliefs within its industry 


-  Ayman Asfari ,  the companys CEO and main shareholder ,  saw an opportunity to move away from the traditional contracting model of the energy industry toward one in which the service provider became an equity partner and assumed some of the overall performance risk 


-  The London-based company achieved  major milestone in 2000 by winning  $1 billion development in southern Algeria with two much larger partners 


-  Key to winning the contract was Petrofacs offer to be  10% equity partner in the development   move that competitors had not considered 


-  As  partner ,  Petrofac was able to complete the project ahead of schedule and within budget 


-  ,  Discarding Discarding involves challenging the companys sacred cows when examination exposes them as falsehoods; this will reduce the amount of nonsense  common or uncommon  the company believes 


-   famous example is Apples decision in the 1990s to relax its vertically integrated business model and begin selling personal computers compatible with the Microsoft operating system and Intel microprocessors 


-  Although the merits of that decision are still being debated ,  it represented  clear recognition by Apple management that the old strategy was failing and that the company needed to take drastic steps to reverse its decline 


-  ,  On  more micro-level ,  Ikea has adapted its business model to adjust to changing market conditions 


-  During the dotcom boom ,  the company refused to consider online selling for fear that its unique value proposition would be undermined 


-  But gradually it acquiesced ,  and it now does  significant share of its business over the web 


-  The company also experienced problems selling its standardized product lines in certain markets 


-  This ,  too ,  has changed with the introduction of larger beds and kitchen cabinets in the  


-  market 


-  Ikea stores must conform to company-wide values and operating principles ,  but today there is considerable freedom within these guidelines 


-  ,  Marooning As  company challenges the orthodox thinking of its industry and replaces it with  fresh ,  market-tested approach ,  it leaves competitors isolated ,  or marooned ,  with an outdated business model 


-  ,  Consider the case of Thomson Reuters governance ,  risk and compliance business ,  which sells information services to corporate compliance officers ,  regulators and lawyers 


-  The standard approach to risk management is to encourage clients to move slowly 


-  However ,  Thomson Reuters takes  different approach 


-  We believe risk management can be agile: You can move quickly and still manage your risks ,  says David Craig ,  president of the governance ,  risk and compliance unit 


-  So we have built our services to help clients accelerate the development of their business ,  rather than slow it down 


-  ,  Another example: In the hotel industry ,  the standard checkout time for guests is noon ,  and check-in is typically after   


-  Located at airports and in major city centers ,  Yotel offers quiet ,  no-frills rooms at affordable prices ,  no matter what time of day or night 


-  But it differs in an important way: The new belief boldly repudiates an existing orthodoxy ,  rather than simply being  new way of thinking 


-  This makes it harder for competitors to reposition their offering 


-  ,  Neutralizing Companies that embrace the uncommon sense of  competitor and incorporate it into their own belief system can reinforce their own market position and neutralize their competitors uncommon sense 


-   good example of this has occurred in recent years in online media 


-  One of the important ways the Internet revolutionized the media industry was that it allowed readers to comment on articles in real time 


-  When web-only media like the Huffington Post offered this option ,  traditional newspapers faced  dilemma: readers wanted to comment ,  but many writers were strongly resistant to the idea 


-  For example ,  in the United Kingdom ,  the Guardian was the first established publication to allow readers to post comments on its online articles 


-  However ,  the introduction of online comment ultimately brought little long-term benefit because nearly everyone else very quickly began to offer it as well 


-  Indeed ,  it has become part of the common sense of the industry 


-  Until the early 1990s ,  responsibility for engine management and maintenance belonged to the airlines that owned the aircraft or to  third-party provider; the assumption was that the financial and operational risks were best carried by the operator 


-  However ,  by acquiring British Airways repair and overhaul facility in South Wales in 1991 ,  GE Aviation challenged this belief 


-  However ,  Rolls-Royce ,  for one ,  quickly recognized the threat and sought to neutralize it by integrating the sale of new engines and the aftermarket 


-  Through an offering called TotalCare ,  it introduced  long-term service agreement that transferred the technical and financial risk of engine fleet management from the airline to Rolls-Royce 


-  Airlines pay  fixed dollar amount per flying hour ,  thereby aligning the incentives of both the operator and the OEM in the pursuit of maximum reliability and use 


-  ,  By neutralizing its key competitors move and improving on it ,  Rolls-Royce has benefited greatly 


-  Since 2000 ,  Rolls-Royce has seen the TotalCare segment of its installed user base grow from 3% to over 65% in 2010 ,  and almost all its new engine orders include the service agreement as  fundamental element of the deal 


-  Instead ,  it is about carefully figuring out which parts of  rivals beliefs to pick up on ,  and which parts to ignore 


-  ,  So how do companies put ideas they develop through our process into action? Based on our experience ,  successful companies dont just talk about their novel beliefs or make risky bets on unproven ideas 


-  They turn one of their novel beliefs into an operational hypothesis and then test it in as low-risk  way as possible 


-  The feedback they get from the market informs their further testing ,  ultimately shaping the companys decision to make  tangible change 


-  ,  The real world ,  of course ,  doesnt allow businesspeople to test ideas as thoroughly as research scientists or academics can 


-  The case of  growing provider of business-to-business customer service solutions called 24/7 Customer ,  based in Campbell ,  California ,  provides an excellent example of how the process can work 


-  The company was founded in 2000 on the belief that customer expectations for customer service would change dramatically with the Internet and that the customer experience should be intuitive 


-  For example ,  when  customer visits an airline website ,  24/7 Customers software monitors the clicks; if it seems that the person needs help ,   pop-up window offers suggestions and  number to call 


-  For mobile phone service providers ,  24/7 Customer offers  feature where individuals can preview their first months phone bill online 


-  More than 80% of mobile phone customers call when they receive their first bill because they are surprised at how large it is ,  explains founder and CEO  


-  This service anticipates their concerns ,  and explains the tariff in detail before it becomes  problem 


-  The result ,  he says ,  is increased customer loyalty and retention 


-  It has its own innovation lab ,  staffed with 100 computer scientists ,  data engineers and consumer behavior specialists dedicated to proposing new service ideas and test sites 


-  If  new idea works out ,  it is then packaged as an offering for the client ,  and eventually it can be made available more widely 


-  Although Kannan concedes that not every experiment leads directly to  useful idea ,  even the ones that dont pan out can result in insights into what customers may be looking for 


-  ,  Finding  distinctive place in  competitive marketplace can be extremely challenging 


-  Studying and working with dozens of companies across  range of industries ,  we have found that it frequently requires willingness on the part of top management to examine and re-examine the prevailing industry norms  and from  variety of perspectives 


-  For example ,  Paul Marsden and Adrian Kinnersley ,  founders of Twenty ,   rapidly growing recruitment consultancy based in London ,  had seen many established recruitment firms rise and fall over the years 


-  One thing they knew was how little loyalty most recruitment professionals had for the agencies they worked for 


-  So ,  as Kinnersley recalls ,  the issues they decided to focus on when contemplating starting  new firm involved thinking about the business from the employees perspective: What did they want the business to feel like for people who worked there? Given what they had seen elsewhere ,  what should its underlying values be? One thing they decided was that the new firm should go against the grain of the recruitment industry and be quirky 


-  For example ,  most recruitment firms were secretive about what individuals earned ,  so Twenty decided that one of its core values was to be crystal clear with its employees: Detailed information about the compensation and bonus system was provided online ,  and the firms financial results were updated monthly ,  for all employees to see 


-  ,  Companies such as 24/7 Customer and Twenty were founded on the premise of doing things differently from other players in their industries 


-  Entrepreneurs are by nature unorthodox thinkers ,  so it is not surprising that many examples of uncommon sense come from this subset of companies 


-  Still ,  there is plenty of scope for established companies to use this framework 


-  In particular ,  the techniques for neutralizing and marooning competitors ,  as well as discarding beliefs that are no longer true ,  have been adopted by major companies including Rolls-Royce and Thomson Reuters 


-  Yes ,  it is challenging to get executives thinking in this unorthodox and experimental way ,  but the potential rewards are enormous 


-  However ,  we think there are advantages to beginning at  different point  with  companys underlying beliefs and with the explicit recognition that some of those beliefs are smart and others arent 


-  Many companies exhibit common sense in the way they pursue market opportunities ,  but only  few have the uncommon sense on which long-lasting success is built 


-  Working with external partners allows them to access different pools of knowledge and save R&D costs 


-  Universities are among the external partners that offer high promise ,  since they allow access to an enormous global pool of talent and skills 


-  ,  Sometimes managers think dealing with universities equals only technology transfer 


-  While the use of university-owned intellectual property2 has spurred much innovation in business ,  it is only the tip of the iceberg 


-  For example ,  in the United Kingdom ,  businesses already spend more than 20 times more on university collaboration than on licensing technology from universities 


-  ,  However ,  working with universities poses considerable challenges for managers 


-  Two fundamental issues afflict collaboration 


-  First ,  the open nature of academic science is at times in conflict with companies need to protect technologies they use 


-  Second ,  while academic research focuses on long-term challenges and thus may move more slowly ,  industrial R&D is driven by time-sensitive product development projects and day-to-day project solving 


-  As  result ,  companies can sometimes find universities too slow and too bureaucratic to be good partners 


-  Given that in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries ,  expenditures on higher education R&D represent about $160 billion per annum ,  businesses that dont work with universities may be missing opportunities of significant proportions 


-  Managers who would never dream of leaving their customer or supplier relationships to chance may take an ad hoc approach to their university relationships ,  which can lead to duplication of effort ,  lost opportunities or squabbles over intellectual property 


-  ,  Our research suggests that businesses can structure their relationships with universities in ways that make them much more valuable 


-  As Claus Otto ,  program manager at Royal Dutch Shell PLC ,  says ,  It is important to ask yourself: What can these university centers do better or different than we can? Shell ,  for example ,  invests in university partnerships in areas where it does not yet make business sense for the company to build extensive technology capability 


-  ,  To leverage value from universities ,  we argue that business executives need to consider two key dimensions 


-  Short-term collaborations are useful ,  common and relatively easy to facilitate if they are targeted and aligned to universities and academics ways of working 


-  However ,  they require creative structuring ,  as the clock speed of academic research and business practice can be wildly divergent 


-  Conversely ,  many academics think long-term ,  and this can be an advantage for  business as it may overcome managers tendency to look to the next quarter 


-  Going long with academics in the search for new ideas can unlock  range of possibilities and even help to create  new innovation ecosystem that will sustain the business five or 10 years into the future 


-  However ,  such long-term collaborations require more patient investment and managerial attention to the design and governance of the collaboration or they can go easily awry 


-  ,  The second dimension is the degree of disclosure of the results of the partnership 


-  ,  If we combine these two dimensions ,  we can see four different collaboration modes: ,  In this type of collaboration ,  businesses engage university partners to work on problems that are relatively short-term ,  while providing the option for the academics to openly publish results 


-  At first glance ,  this type of collaboration seems to provide little benefit to companies ,  given that they are not able to exclusively appropriate research outcomes 


-  First ,  it can act as  honey pot ,  helping to attract academics to the problems and challenges of the business 


-  As these projects are well aligned to academic norms ,  many scientists find ways of drawing academic capital even from incremental ,  applied research 


-  These projects are usually small scale and ,  given the absence of delicate intellectual property issues ,  easy to set up and administer 


-  One successful example of this approach is HP Laboratories Innovation Research Program 


-  Every year ,  HP Labs solicits ideas from academics on selected research topics with the aim of building new research collaborations 


-  Although the size of the grants is modest  ( $50 , 000$75 , 000 )  ,  HP receives around 500 proposals per year ,  selecting close to 50 


-  To manage intellectual property for these projects ,  HP Labs uses  standardized collaborative research agreement that entitles academics to publish their results ,  but it also provides HP with the nonexclusive right to use the findings 


-  Another example is Bayer AGs Grants4Targets program ,  which provides grants ranging from $5 , 000 to $125 , 000 to researchers wishing to explore and validate drug targets 


-  The bureaucracy is consciously kept to  minimum ,  and successful applicants are allocated  Bayer scientist as project partner 


-  ,  These types of programs allow companies to test  professors aptitude to work on industry-related projects and his or her ability to manage projects in  timely manner 


-  To this purpose ,  companies should choose projects that are relatively low risk and that do not result in major opportunity costs or other damage if they fail 


-  Often ,  this type of project is about testing ideas that company R&D personnel may have but that do not yet warrant  major investment within the company 


-  Establishing small-scale collaborations with  number of players ,  possibly internationally ,  constitutes  cost-effective way to test the waters in  variety of emerging research areas 


-  IBM Faculty Awards ,  for example ,  is  program that allows IBM to gain insights into the cutting edge of research from across the world at  modest cost 


-  No intellectual property is stipulated as part of the award ,  and IBM strongly encourages the research results to be published 


-  ,  How should companies undertake such short-term open explorations? First ,  it is important for companies to explain the problems in  way that will help academics work toward useful solutions 


-  Third ,  the emphasis in managing the project should not be on timely delivery ,  but on the results 


-  From  companys perspective ,  outcomes are likely to be highly skewed ,  with  number of projects that will yield some results but that will not necessarily produce eureka moments ,  and  number of failures 


-  However ,  if  series of projects are pursued in  portfolio ,  this risk can be mitigated ,  in part because the cost of each project is rather low 


-  An executive at  major oil company told us that he was happy if 20% of such exploratory projects resulted in some positive output after two years 


-  ,   further risk is that  company may fail to absorb the lessons from these kinds of projects ,  as in many cases follow-on projects are required to gain the full benefit of the research 


-  To ensure that these risks are overcome ,  managers should seek to deepen and extend the most promising relationships by assigning an internal champion to work alongside the external academic partner and creating  more long-term arrangement 


-  ,  Working on open and long-term grand challenges is the sweet spot for most academics ,  who often thrive on big problems 


- 11 Yet all results from this research are placed in the public domain with no restrictions 


-  ,  What do companies gain from sponsoring such open innovation projects? For companies ,  it can make sense to fund open ,  long-term research even though they may forfeit the ability to appropriate the results in  legal sense 


- 12 In pharmaceuticals ,  for example ,  executives are well aware that the cost of developing drugs is constantly rising while research productivity is declining 


-  In this situation ,  Malcolm Skingle ,  director of academic liaison at GlaxoSmithKline ,  believes it may make sense to invest collectively in building an industry commons to instigate  game change in the speed of new knowledge creation 


-  His counterparts at Merck ,  Novartis and Pfizer agree and have invested together in open science initiatives even though they are otherwise fierce competitors 


-  ,  Second ,  companies may seek to create new fields and markets by funding new research programs 


-  Such research is bound to diffuse more quickly and widely than results from more protected initiatives ,  and it allows companies therefore to shape emerging fields 


-  For instance ,  IBM has funded major research initiatives in service science ,  allowing it to shape problems and agendas of this newly emerging discipline 


- 13 Open research programs can attract follow-on research by academics that may not have been part of the original initiative 


- 14 For example ,  after Arup Group Ltd 


-  One example is  five-year grand challenge on cleaner fossil fuels between Royal Dutch Shell and Imperial College London 


-  Launched in 2007 ,  the project focuses on developing technologies that reduce the carbon impact of extracting hydrocarbons 


-  Such leverage may compensate for the lack of ability to appropriate the returns of the initial investment 


-  As Stuart Feldman said when he was vice president for computer science at IBMs research laboratories: Universities have made life increasingly difficult to do research with them because of all the contractual issues around intellectual property 


-  Some successful initiatives were built with special-purpose vehicles to take on both strategy and day-to-day management 


-  When GlaxoSmithKline helped start the Structural Genomics Consortium ,  the partners set up the consortium as an independent entity   not-for-profit company headquartered in Toronto ,  governed by  board of directors composed of members of the participating pharmaceutical companies and other funders ,  including the Wellcome Trust 


-  Aled Edwards ,   life sciences professor who is also the founder of  biotech company and hence commanded respect in both the academic and commercial realms ,  was recruited as CEO 


-  Led by  CEO with  wide-ranging mandate ,  special-purpose vehicles can be an effective way to overcome the paralysis that often afflicts bilateral or multilateral committees 


-  Therefore ,  company sponsors not only need to be present at  strategic level but also need to be involved on  technical level 


-  An additional benefit of being closely involved on  technical level is being better able to absorb the outcomes of the research 


-  ,  for example ,  has structured its Science and Technology Centers and International Institutes with engagement at both levels 


-  Moreover ,  large ,  open collaborations do not preclude the launch of more specific point projects that can follow other models ,  if necessary 


-  ,  Even when an initiative is open ,  companies need to be careful that proprietary information is not released into the public domain 


-  To maximize sponsor influence ,  and minimize knowledge leakage ,  the Structural Genomics Consortium devised  mechanism whereby sponsors requirements were kept confidential ,  both within the organization and from the outside world 


-  The SGC management was  trusted broker that carefully managed information flows and prevented leakage 


-  ,  University researchers can be particularly capable partners for non-routine problems because they have access to the brainpower of highly specialized research groups and bring  different perspective than that in corporate environments 


-  They usually are also less vested in commercial interests compared to suppliers ,  vendors and consultants ,  who may have their preferred solutions to problems 


-  ,  For example ,  an international engine manufacturer we studied experienced some unexpected problems with an innovative prototype engine 


-  The engine performed wonderfully in most aspects ,  but occasionally it blew up 


-  Company R&D engineers were at  loss to explain these failures and decided to turn to their university partners for help 


-  For the company ,  this was  burning short-term problem that required highly developed analytical capabilities 


-  From their point of view ,  the opportunity cost can be high 


-  In addition ,  these projects are usually highly confidential ,  and the business needs to protect the problem and the solution 


-  This limits the academic partners ability to extract academic capital by publishing the results 


-  ,  The trick is to make these projects more attractive to academics by making them part of  longer-term relationship 


-  In the above example ,  the engine manufacturer already had long-term relationships with the research groups ,  and it was therefore easier to persuade them to engage in firefighting 


-   former global head of university partnerships at  major defense company explained that traditionally it was difficult to recruit academics for short-term contracts 


-  This changed when he started  company-wide university partnership program that weeded out nonproductive relationships and put the successful ones on  stronger footing 


-  Relationships forged on the anvil of  pressing problem may generate the trust to enable richer and deeper future research collaborations 


-  Academics may also find that such projects provide  stimulus to their own research questions ,  framing an interesting problem for them to later investigate with greater theoretical and empirical precision 


-  ,  The benefit of these types of projects for companies is that they can set objectives for collaboration and expect delivery on these objectives as they would from  commercial organization 


-  Such projects allow companies to quickly expand their existing stock of expertise and skills and produce tangible outcomes ,  focused around  live problem or issue in the company 


-  They also allow the business to keep the nature and solution to its problems confidential ,  excluding others from the potential solution 


-  ,  Although short-term ,  protected collaboration can be highly attractive and remain  common form of collaboration ,  such projects rely on businesses to have  rich Rolodex of academic contacts whom they trust and can work with ,  and whose research areas are closely matched to the businesss problems 


-  Some companies have developed  university engagement database ,  similar to  customer relationship management database ,  to track ,  assess and value different university contacts 


-  Businesses may want to put selected academics on consulting retainers so that they are well positioned to attend to problems as they emerge rather than arriving after the problem has already taken hold 


-  Some companies use open idea lab projects to form new contacts 


-  For instance ,  many universities have consultancy service offices that are experienced in drawing up contracts and offer professional indemnity insurance coverage 


-  For larger projects ,  most universities have business partnership units or industry liaison programs that take care of the contractual and administrative side of collaborations ,  help recruit sponsors and liaise with academics and departments ,  acting as  centralized point of contact for the university and its industrial partners 


-  In many cases ,  such activities are pursued from within the technology transfer offices18 that will also be responsible for dealing with any intellectual property arising from their projects 


-  Universities can also be overly optimistic about the value of the intellectual property that may arise from the collaboration ,  even though only  minority of collaborative university-industry projects results in patentable output 


- 21 ,  In order to avoid such conflicts ,  managers should proactively seek to build relationships with university outreach offices 


-  One approach that can help avoid protracted negotiations is to invest in framework agreements with key university partners 


-  These agreements offer  set of model contracts and  rapid-fire system for launching contract research agreements 


-  An example of this approach can be seen in Procter  Gambles collaborative agreements with the University System of Ohio in the United States ,  Durham University in the United Kingdom ,  and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel 


-  This allows the company to provide  more scalable approach to adding new sponsors and universities to its large institutes ,  while enforcing  consistent governance model and avoiding an undue administrative burden for its partner universities 


-  ,  Long-term ,  deep and protected collaborations with universities enable companies to not only create new knowledge ,  but also to gain competitive advantage from the outputs of these research efforts 


-  This approach allows the researchers to do the long-term work they do best ,  and the company to preempt its competitors from accessing the downstream application of these ideas 


-  ,  Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC is an example of  company that has applied the deep exploration approach 


-  Twenty years ago ,  the company established the first Rolls-Royce University Technology Centres with universities in Britain 


-  Each of the centers focuses on  specialized area of technological expertise ,  such as combustion ,  aerodynamics ,  noise and vibration or manufacturing technology 


-  This allows the company to maintain centers of excellence that are more resourceful and specialized than it would be able to justify internally 


-  Each of the centers is funded for five-year intervals ,  and renewals are common provided specific performance milestones are met 


-  ,  For companies ,  the attractiveness of such deep explorations is that they allow the business to exert some control over the direction of the research program ,  guiding researchers into areas that are more relevant and useful to the company 


-  Such agreements also ensure  strong alignment between the companys R&D strategy and research ,  helping to overcome the tendency toward agenda drift associated with more open grand challenges 


-  Through the intellectual property provisions in such relationships ,  companies can also mitigate the danger of knowledge leakage by their university partners 


-  Moreover ,  they can invest more deeply in the collaboration ,  disclosing critical ideas to their external partners to learn more effectively together 


-  ,  This approach is ,  however ,  not cheap 


-  Often ,  the price of exclusivity is high and requires parallel investments from the business to make it work successfully 


-   typical mechanism for deep explorations is to set up  medium-term agreement  ( often more than three years )  with an academic partner to establish  new center or invest in an existing center 


-  Within the agreement ,  it is important to specify the relationship between the company and research organizations and how payments may be tied to specific milestones or achievements 


-  For example ,  Pfizers 2006 agreement with The Scripps Research Institute22 provided $100 million of research funding for five years 


-  In exchange for the support ,  Pfizer claimed the right of first refusal to license almost half of the discoveries Scripps makes 


-  As part of the agreement ,  Pfizer has to decide within one or two months whether to exercise its licensing option on  discovery 


-  If Pfizer does not exercise its option ,  Scripps can seek alternative industrial partners to exploit the idea 


-  Businesses may find that academics promise one thing and deliver another 


-  In one university-industry research center we studied ,  we found that the same project had been sold to the industry partner twice 


-  Fundamentally ,  agreements like deep explorations create incentive problems for academics ,  since many of them seek to publish and diffuse their work rather than produce innovations that will be exclusively licensed by  corporate sponsor 


- 23 Managers in some industries ,  such as pharmaceuticals and oil ,  have to be particularly careful in this respect 


-  When the agribusiness arm of Novartis entered into  landmark $25-million contract with the Department of Plant  Microbial Biology at the University of California ,  Berkeley ,  in 1998 ,  it seeded  controversy revolving around the appropriation of open research by private interests and led to an external review 


-  and other firms signed  10-year ,  $225-million deal with Stanford University to fund the Global Climate and Energy Project 


-  ,  There are ways to overcome many of these problems 


-  First ,  because many academics work with industry primarily to further their academic research programs ,  it is important for businesses to offer academics access to interesting problems ,  data or equipment 


-  Providing them with interesting clues or problems will often result in solutions that interest both the business and the academic community 


- 25 Second ,  any decision to patent  discovery or restrict publications due to confidential information in  deep exploration partnership requires fast approval processes so that academics are not left waiting to know whether they may publish or not 


-  Businesses must agree with their academic partners on  streamlined system for managing disclosures ,  whereby academics are allowed to publish important but noncritical findings around an invention 


-  For example ,  rewarding inventors with academic prizes for major discoveries ,  such as endowed chairs or multiyear fellowships ,  may help motivate ,  recruit and retain junior faculty 


-  Some universities are highly skilled at working with industrial partners ,  collaborating frequently with industry  whereas others have limited experience 


-  Managers should carefully assess the level of collaborative capability of their potential university partners ,  avoiding costly and time-consuming setup costs and the possibility of later disputes over the ownership of ideas 


-  For example ,  in most countries ,  the inventions of academics are owned by their universities 


-  ,  When determining the best model to follow with  university partner ,  managers should carefully assess the nature of the university they are working with 


-  By balancing considerations such as time horizon and degree of openness ,  managers can turn universities into valuable partners in both the short and long run  provided the relationships are designed in advance to meet both organizations goals
