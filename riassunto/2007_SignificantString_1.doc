-  Applied to decision making ,  it means involving as many people as possible in the process  keeping employees informed ,  soliciting their input ,  making sure everyone has  fair shot at expressing an opinion 


-  ,  And yet in certain cases ,  its simply impossible to involve anyone beyond  small group 


-  The need for confidentiality and speed are constraints ,  as is the sheer difficulty of polling an organization of thousands of employees regarding decisions that will affect the entire company 


-  Managers or executives must sometimes download  decision to their people after the fact  and that is where many  decision crashes on rocky shoals 


-  Consider these scenarios: ,  Could anything have been done to avert these failures? ,  There are at least three reasons for ineffective downloading 


-  During the process ,  the decision-making group weighs contradictory evidence ,  debates interpretations ,  integrates facts and opinions ,  and considers the benefits and drawbacks of various alternatives 


-  At the end of the process ,  the decision makers often pat themselves on the back for persevering through all the complexities ,  uncertainties and quandaries to reach  reasonable and defensible decision 


-  By that time ,  they have often labored over  decision so long that they believe it needs no explanation 


-  They may even become exasperated by the need to explain something so understandable and reasonable 


-  Lacking knowledge of the facts that were considered ,  the alternatives that were debated and the obstacles that were overcome ,  they are unprepared psychologically to understand what they have been told 


-  Jaded veterans of such communicative practices reason that this too shall pass 


-  In fact ,  traditional decision-making models give scant attention to communicating the decision 


-  ,  Any organization that lacks an understanding of the decision-making process will have trouble grasping  realistic view of its environment and will as  result have difficulty detecting and correcting strategic or tactical errors 


-  ,  Leaders often want to screen their people from the worst of organizational anxieties  the possibility of layoffs ,  financial distress and strategic confusion 


-  Army War College ,  one asked ,  Arent leaders supposed to be uncertainty buffers? Translation: Why confuse the troops with the messy decision-making process? This officer reasoned that the troops dont want to hear all the gory details; they just want the bottom line 


-  ,  No doubt ,  many of his troops did prefer such an approach 


-  That desire persists even in employees who do not personally feel comfortable with uncertainty 


-  We discovered that executives we call robust decision downloaders communicate to employees by discussing how  decision was made ,  why it was made ,  what alternatives were considered ,  how the decision fits into the organizational mission and vision ,  how it will affect the organization and how it will affect employees 


-  ,  On the other side ,  remedial decision downloaders provide little or no information on these matters 


-  Employees are often left to discover the answers by chance or through their personal networks 


-  Employees were then directed to the company Web site for  more detailed version of the announcement as well as  question-and-answer section 


-  Within two days of the announcement ,  small-group meetings were held to allow employees to ask questions ,  voice concerns and interact directly with those involved in making the decision 


-  Following all the small-group meetings ,  the company Web site summarized the dialogue and added to the question-and-answer section 


-  These follow-up interactions defused ungrounded rumors and allowed the decision makers to explain actively how they had arrived at their decision 


-  ,  At this stage ,  robust downloaders seek to understand how employees will respond to the decision 


-  ,  The first critical task in this stage is to gain an understanding of employees conceptual terrain 


-  The critical questions to ask about each group are: What do employees already know  ( or think they know )  about the facts surrounding the decision? What are the likely resistance points? Who are the opinion leaders? Answering these questions allows decision makers to create the right strategy ,  message and tools for bridging the differing perspectives 


-  People make sense of events by comparing them to past events ,  similar situations or personal expectations 


-  Most will compare the new offer to the existing contract and find it wanting 


-  Better simply to acknowledge the deficiencies and shift attention to  more advantageous comparison 


-  The WIN campaign cleverly promoted  memorable catchphrase that ,  no doubt ,  resonated with many citizens and was linked to  variety of government initiatives 


-  ,  In this phase ,  decision makers with  robust process seek to create an understanding of the decision and bolster their credibility 


-  Credibility is not something possessed by the one communicating; it is bestowed on that person by the audience 


-  As one veteran communications professional puts it ,  People need the icon  somebody who personifies the decision and the change the company is trying to make 


-  They avoid using  spray and pray communication strategy: spraying employees with information while praying for their understanding and motivation 


-  ,  Amplifying the message helps employees answer two vexing questions: What counts? and How does this fit with what we are already doing? For example ,  after leaders announce  renewed effort to improve customer service ,  employees want to know which specific actions or behaviors count toward achieving this goal 


-  In  sound-bite culture ,  decision makers need to provide conceptual snacks ,  but they also must elaborate on the concepts in meaningful ways so that employees have something to chew on 


-  It just makes sense 


-  Decisions that are not linked to the organizations mission or policies are often perceived as fragmented ,  unfounded and devoid of meaning 


-  ,  The third strategy used by robust downloaders in this phase is to highlight the thinking process and the key facts that led to the decision 


-  In the second ,  an executive explains the major issues that were considered in arriving at the decision 


-  In this case ,  the executive is acting on the belief that creating  visceral understanding of the decision-making process will result in greater commitment to the decision and an ability to respond more flexibly to changing conditions 


-  The distinction is critical: An announcement provides information while communication seeks employees understanding and acceptance of the decision 


-  Conversely ,  written documents can underscore the core arguments and critical facts that helped produce the decision 


-  ,  During the monitoring phase ,  robust downloaders seek to understand how employees are reacting to the announcement 


-  They must root out misrepresentations ,  misunderstandings ,  distortions and rumors and then respond appropriately 


-  Effective downloaders use the following strategies: ,  First ,  they enlist opinion leaders 


-  While people usually nod their heads when told about something new ,  they often do not understand the message well 


-  Asking them if they understand is not enough 


-  Opinion leaders actually check employee understanding and help them make sense of  decision 


-  ,  Robust decision downloaders identify key opinion leaders ,  determine their understanding of  decision ,  seek their input and assess their degree of support 


-  If opinion leaders express resistance ,  robust downloaders address their concerns and determine how to gain their endorsements 


-  In many respects ,  the buy-in of opinion leaders is the most important determinant of whether the decision becomes fully implemented 


-  This delay makes sense for scientific reasons: Cognitive neuroscientists have demonstrated that there are physical limitations to the amount of information that people can absorb in  short period 


-  ,  Likewise ,  responding too quickly to employee concerns can actually hinder the sense-making process 


-  People in the organization simply cannot make sense of all the stimuli at once 


-  Such contracts are filled with arcane language and legalese ,  and people in an organization simply cannot make sense of everything at once 


-  By linking new initiatives to this phrase ,  employees subtly resisted change ,  disengaged from the process and stopped further discussion ,  regardless of the merits of  proposal 


-  In this case ,  leaders directly attacked the clich by presenting  direct counterargument: This initiative is not one of these here-we-go-again ideas and heres why&mldr; Then they invited employees to discuss the differences between the initiative and others that had failed in the past 


-  This approach sent two very strong signals: first ,  that the leadership team understood employees preconceptions ,  and second ,  that the team wanted to move beyond the clich and engage in serious discussions about the initiative 


-  ,  ROBUST DECISION DOWNLOADERS OPERATE with  more enlightened understanding of communication than their remedial counterparts 


-  They perceive communication as  dialogue with negotiated meanings rather than  conveyor belt of transmitted symbols 


-  They realize they have the power to initiate and encode messages  but the members of the organization have the power ,  in turn ,  to decode and translate those messages ,  for better or for worse ,  in the context of discussions with their peers and opinion leaders 


-  The most effective communicators believe that cultivating an understanding of the decision-making process  with all its tough calls ,  blemishes ,  uncertainties and implications for the organization and employees  engenders the most important feature of sustained success: trust
