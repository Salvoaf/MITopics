- When German car manufacturer Volkswagen was caught cheating on its diesel emissions testing regime  few years ago ,  the subsequent scandal launched numerous lawsuits ,  cost billions of dollars in fines ,  and severely harmed the companys reputation 


-  The actions  and inaction  of dozens of employees at all levels ,  across divisions and countries ,  contributed to this disaster ,  including the software engineers who designed the cheating device ,  the workers who installed it ,  the managers who approved the fitting and testing ,  and the members of the senior leadership team who either orchestrated the scam or simply turned  blind eye 


-  ,  Of course ,  VW isnt an isolated example 


-  Why do such scandals continue ,  despite the clear moral and financial imperatives for ethical action? And  perhaps more important  what can be done to change matters? ,  Although some argue that people are innately inclined to behave unethically out of self-interest ,  our research reveals that organizational ethics matter significantly to most employees and managers ,  and that people want to work for employers whose values and principles are aligned with their own 


-  Whats more ,  research has shown  link between ethical leadership and task performance ,  organizational citizenship ,  and other productive work behaviors6  companies have many compelling reasons to address ethical failings at the earliest opportunity 


-  organizations   national government department ,   nationwide retailer ,   nonprofit in the social services sector ,   county-level police force ,  and  construction company  to tell us about their experiences of both ethical and unethical practices on the part of their colleagues ,  line managers ,  and senior executives 


-  Over time ,   consistent mishandling of these micro-level issues can spiral into macro-level corporate scandal 


-  Here ,  we discuss several murky areas that employees must navigate and ways that organizations can help them make ethical choices day to day 


-  ( An ethically strong situation ,  in contrast ,  is one in which the right thing to do is clearly communicated to employees and people have the motivation and ability to behave in ways that are consistent with the organizations ethical code 


-  ,  Here are the daily dilemmas we found that tend to muddy the ethical waters for individuals in decisions both large and small 


-  Sometimes employees observe  gap between their personal ethics and those of the wider organization ,  and that makes them uneasy 


-  An abundance of studies show that people want to fit in at work9  but its not just  fit with the requirements of the job or even  fit with the organizations culture that matters 


-  New research is beginning to show that people have  strong desire to gain  sense of moral fit as well 


-  When they struggle to do so ,  they often withdraw and may quit their jobs altogether 


-  This sentiment is echoed by many 


-  Every organization has  range of stakeholders affected by its decisions ,  including employees ,  suppliers ,  clients ,  senior managers ,  the local community ,  wider society ,  and even the environment 


- 11 Organizations may have an explicit approach to balancing these competing needs  but that may not be the same as the implicit approach that employees witness every day 


-  ,  When we asked employees and their leaders to rank the order in which stakeholders matter in important decisions ,  consensus was rare 


-  As one employee in the retail sector said ,  Even though weve got  vision and weve got an ethical policy framework ,   personally feel very strongly that [in practice] its shareholder ,  company ,  colleague ,  in that order 


-  One manager told us ,  Sometimes ,  the choices we have to make are not overtly compromising ,  but they can make things difficult  people asking for access to services when theyre not entitled to them ,  or people jumping the queue 


-  Even different departments within the same organization face competing priorities when having to choose between stakeholder groups 


-  However ,  each time an employee or  leader makes  decision that implicitly or explicitly favors one stakeholder group over another ,  it sends  message to other employees about what really matters  and whose interests the organization is willing to sacrifice 


-  Witnessing unethical conduct by  colleague or superior forces people to decide: Do  take this further? If so ,  how? And what will be the consequences for me and for others? ,  Often ,  whether or not people challenge unethical behavior depends on the nature of the infraction ,  the setting within which it takes place ,  the seniority and roles of those involved ,  and the potential risks of challenging the behavior 


-  One government manager seemed to have realized this ,  saying ,  Im quite an outspoken person ,  and nobody has ever challenged my behavior ,  even though in some circumstances  recognize that  perhaps go  bit too far 


-  ,  Some employees we spoke with described instances when they chose to stay silent 


-  Discussing an event when bonuses were awarded to everyone except the hourly workers on the front line ,  one retail employee said: ,  And  junior police officer told us: ,  When employees choose to stay quiet  even with good intentions  alternate viewpoints are silenced ,  levels of engagement and commitment are likely to diminish , 12 and others note that failure to challenge is the norm 


-  ,  Conversely ,  in the construction company ,  an employee was comfortable publicly challenging  colleague for the use of sexist language; when the perpetrator apologized immediately ,  the interaction sent  positive message to others about how to handle such situations 


-  Another challenge is deciding what to do when the ethical solution to  problem is not the expedient solution  often because there arent enough hours ,  dollars ,  or people to make the ethical solution happen 


-  As one retail manager put it: ,  In the context of the police ,  this kind of problem meant that officers had to make choices about which crimes to investigate ,  causing a huge amount of strain and stress to officers because they cant do the job theyre trained to do ,  that theyre paid to do ,  that they want to do ,  and is the reason why they joined in the first place ,  according to  leading officer on the force 


-  Our research and analysis suggest that the following six steps can help leaders set an ethically strong tone so that employees are better equipped to make the right choices day to day 


-  This drives individuals to internalize their decision-making processes  which can create  slippery slope 


-  ,  In the police force we studied ,  even though leading officers were well aware that budget cuts meant increased workloads and longer hours for the rank and file ,  they had not openly acknowledged these pressures with their staff and how they might affect day-to-day decision-making  preventing an authentic dialogue about the problems or possible solutions 


-  One leading officer said ,  We are really struggling ,  and were not admitting that to people on the ground 


-  Officers and staff felt the pressure but ,  given the lack of open discussion ,  assumed that senior leaders did not care 


-  ,  In organizations with  culture of transparency ,  people are more inclined to seek to understand the underlying rationale for decisions 


-  This has  positive effect on ethical decision-making because values are exposed when they are openly discussed rather than inferred from town hall meetings or company documentation 


-  We dont make decisions in hiding; we make decisions in  very consultative way 


-  ,  Most decisions will affect more than one set of stakeholders 


-  Although the needs of all groups can sometimes be met ,  trade-offs are usually necessary 


-  ,  In the retail company ,  leaders paid lip service to meeting customers needs above all others ,  but their behavior wasnt always consistent with that message ,  which created confusion 


-  Employees reported that decision-making was more often governed by immediate profit considerations and key performance indicators 


-  Some felt  degree of cynicism toward the companys customer first rhetoric ,  believing that in practice senior executives were more concerned about hitting performance and sales targets by persuading customers to buy add-on products and services than about caring for the customer or providing excellent customer service 


-  One employee said: You always have that tagline at the end ,  The customer comes first ,  but at the end of the day its  business and the people at the top know we need to hit  KPI figure 


-  ,  Providing employees with  clear statement of vision can help them weigh competing concerns and make appropriate trade-offs 


-  In the police force ,  for instance ,   widely shared Plan on  Page helped officers understand policing priorities  ( such as child abuse and exploitation ,  modern slavery ,  and violence )  and provided guidance on serving the needs of the community  ( by putting the victim first and communicating effectively with the public )  while also making the most efficient use of resources 


-  VW is  case in point: Though senior executives claimed to care about clean diesel ,  they apparently both condoned deliberate cheating on emissions tests and encouraged employees to hide or destroy its evidence 


-  As one employee in the construction business said ,  If your direct line manager isnt setting an example for you ,  it detracts from the message that the business is giving 


-  In the retail business ,  for example ,  the staff talked positively of the family atmosphere and shared values within individual stores and regions that counteracted the dominant cost control messages from the head office 


-  However ,   much more reliable approach is to set the desired example at the top 


-  The nonprofit fostered an ethically strong situation by clearly showing how core ethical dilemmas should be resolved: When  company bidding to work with it asked one of the nonprofits trustees to put in  good word for it ,  its leaders immediately ruled out the company as  partner due to  misalignment of ethical values 


-  As one police officer said ,  they help people understand why we need to behave ,  act ,  do things in  certain way ,  and what the consequences are for not doing that 


-  For example ,  at the nonprofit we examined ,  employees were frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas when working with clients ,  such as how to assess mental capacity or how to manage end-of-life issues and determine appropriate levels of treatment and support 


-  The organization helps its employees make ethical decisions by developing clear policies on approaches to care and providing training that specifically focuses on such challenges 


-  ,  Similarly ,  at the construction company ,  part of the recruitment process involves matching applicants ethical values with those of the business 


-  It has also adopted  code of conduct and  formal framework called What Good Looks Like to guide employee behavior 


-  Training on topics such as how to deal with anti-competition risks and health and safety issues is compulsory for line managers ,  and an online system allows for logging any health and safety issues as they arise 


-  Although employees sometimes feel that these processes slow decision-making ,  they provide clarity and consistency ,  and people know what is expected of them ,  according to  front-line manager 


-  Ethical breaches will inevitably arise ,  of course  whether through error ,  neglect ,  or deliberate action 


-  But ethically strong organizations explicitly say how people should deal with them when they do occur ,  in addition to trying to prevent them in the first place 


-  For example ,  employees in the construction company are required to challenge decisions and actions that could compromise the health and safety of employees and customers alike 


-  One manager said that the culture around this is so strong that in extreme circumstances ,  people have lost their jobs because they havent followed through on what really is their duty to either challenge it there and then or report it later to make sure remedial action can be put in place 


-  ,  In ethically weak organizations ,  challenging peoples behavior is not the norm 


-  Sometimes employees fear retribution ,  because they do not see others around them raising questions 


-  The construction companys ethical vision of sustainability translates into protecting the environment as well as safeguarding its employees and customers 


-  ,  When  companys mission or vision is unclear or divorced from ethics ,  or ,  as  senior leader at the retail organization said ,  when the why is missing altogether ,  an opportunity to provide guidance is lost and an ethically weak situation develops 


-  ,  Setting the stage for ethical behavior isnt just  top-down exercise  though clear direction and positive role-modeling from senior executives do help 


-  ,  No company is immune from ethically questionable decision-making
