-  ,  To think about how this will happen ,  its useful to contemplate an obvious but not widely appreciated fact 


-  ,  The human groups that accomplish all these things can be described as superminds 


-   define  supermind as  group of individuals acting together in ways that seem intelligent 


-  ,  Superminds take many forms 


-  ,  All superminds have  kind of collective intelligence ,  an ability to do things that the individuals in the groups couldnt have done alone 


-  That means we will be able to combine people and machines to create superminds that are smarter than any groups or individuals our planet has ever known 


-  ,  To do that ,  we need to understand how people and computers can work together more effectively on tasks that require intelligence 


-  And for that ,  we need to define intelligence 


-  And since we dont always know what goals an individual or group is trying to achieve ,  lets say that whether an entity seems intelligent depends on what goals an observer attributes to it 


-  This means that an intelligent entity will do whatever is most likely to help it achieve its goals ,  based on everything it knows 


-  In this sense ,  then ,  specialized collective intelligence is group effectiveness ,  and  supermind is an effective group 


-  This means that an intelligent actor needs not only to be good at  specific kind of task but also to be good at learning how to do  wide range of tasks 


-  In this sense ,  then ,  general collective intelligence means group versatility or group adaptability ,  and  supermind is  versatile or adaptable group 


-  But one of the most important things most people dont realize about AI today is that it is all very specialized 


-  ,  In fact ,  none of todays computers are anywhere close to having the level of general intelligence of any normal human 5-year-old 


-  No single computer today can converse sensibly about the vast number of topics an ordinary 5-year-old can ,  not to mention the fact that the child can also walk ,  pick up weirdly shaped objects ,  and recognize when people are happy ,  sad ,  or angry 


-  When researchers Stuart Armstrong and Kaj Sotala analyzed 95 predictions made between 1950 and 2012 about when general AI would be achieved ,  they found  strong tendency for both experts and nonexperts to predict that it would be achieved between 15 and 25 years in the future  regardless of when the predictions were made 


-  So while we certainly dont know for sure ,  there is good reason to be skeptical of confident predictions that general AI will appear in the next couple of decades 


-  ,  All uses of computers will need to involve humans in some way until then 


-  For instance ,  one part of the brain is heavily involved in producing language ,  another in understanding language ,  and still another in processing visual information 


-  Marvin Minsky ,  one of the fathers of AI ,  called this architecture  society of mind 


-  ,  Minsky was primarily interested in how human brains worked and how artificial intelligence programs might be developed ,  but his analogy also suggests  surprisingly important idea for how superminds consisting of both people and computers might work: Long before we have general AI ,  we can create more and more collectively intelligent systems by building societies of mind that include both humans and machines ,  each doing part of the overall task 


-  In some cases ,  the people may not even know  or care  whether they are interacting with another human or  machine 


-  The machines can supply the knowledge and other capabilities that people dont have 


-  ,  How is this different from current thinking about AI? Many people today assume that computers will eventually do most things by themselves and that we should put humans in the loop in situations where people are still needed 


-  But its probably more useful to realize that most things now are done by groups of people ,  and we should put computers into these groups in situations where that is helpful 


-  In other words ,  we should move away from thinking about putting humans in the loop to putting computers in the group 


-  With email ,  mobile applications ,  the web in general ,  and sites such as Facebook ,  Google ,  Wikipedia ,  Netflix ,  YouTube ,  and Twitter ,  weve created the most massively connected groups the world has ever known 


-  ,  While we often overestimate the potential of AI ,   think we often underestimate the potential power of this kind of hyperconnectivity among the  billion or so amazingly powerful information processors called human brains that are already on our planet 


-  And ,  of course ,  they can relate to customers in  more personal way than the assistant does 


-  For example ,  if you are  stock trader ,  you may already be transacting with an automated program trading system without knowing it 


-  ,  Human managers delegate tasks ,  give directions ,  evaluate work ,  and coordinate others efforts 


-  Then it asked other workers to find relevant facts for each section in the outline 


-  Next it asked still other workers to write coherent paragraphs using those facts 


-  ,  If you want to design  supermind  ( like  company or  team )  that can act intelligently ,  it needs to have some or all of the five cognitive processes that intelligent entities have  whether they are individuals or groups 


-  Your supermind will need to create possibilities for action ,  decide which actions to take ,  sense the external world ,  remember the past ,  and learn from experience 


-  )  ,  Computers can help do all these things in new ways that often  but ,  of course ,  not always  make the superminds smarter 


-  To see how ,  lets consider how  large corporation like Procter  Gamble could develop  new strategic plan 


-   have no reason to believe that P&G is doing these things at present 


-  But  think that P&G and many other companies are likely to do things like this in the future 


-  But what if we could use technology to involve far more people and let machines do some of the thinking? ,  As we saw above ,  one of the most important roles for computers is as  communication tool that allows much larger groups of people to think together productively 


-   promising approach for doing that within the strategic planning process is to use  family of related online contests ,  called  contest web 


-  Eventually there would be one winning strategy chosen in each challenge ,  but during the planning process ,  it would be important to consider  number of different options 


-  For instance ,  P&G might want its manufacturing engineers to evaluate whether it is technically feasible to make  product ,  its operations managers to estimate manufacturing cost ,  and perhaps outside market researchers to predict the demand for the product at different price points 


-  ,  In some cases ,  it may be worth combining many peoples opinions about some of these questions 


-  For instance ,  if you believe that global sales for Pantene shampoo will be between $1 


- 12 ,   key necessity for developing good strategic plans is the ability to effectively sense what is going on in the external world: What do customers want now? What are our competitors doing? What new technologies might change our industry? By far the most visible means for improving sensing today are big data and data analytics 


-  ,  P&G might even be able to do something Amazon 


-  ,  Another way technology can help superminds create better strategic plans is by helping them remember good ideas that others have had in similar situations 


-  ,  If  system is used over time ,  it can help  supermind learn from its own experience to become more and more effective 


-  Such  strategy-machine company ,  for instance ,  could have  stable of people at many levels of expertise on call who could rapidly generate and evaluate various strategic possibilities ,  along with software to automate some parts of the process and help manage the rest 


-  ,  In the long run ,  such  strategy machine might use  supermind of people and computers to generate and evaluate millions of possible strategies for  single company 


-  ,  The examples weve just discussed are focused on strategic decision-making ,  but what weve really seen is an architecture for general purpose ,  problem-solving superminds: Computers use their specialized intelligence to solve parts of the problem ,  people use their general intelligence to do the rest ,  and computers help engage and coordinate far larger groups of people than has ever been possible 


-  ,  As new technologies make this easier ,  we are likely to see many more examples of human-computer superminds being used to solve all kinds of business and societal problems  not just corporate strategic plans ,  but also designs for new houses ,  smartphones ,  factories ,  cities ,  educational systems ,  antiterrorism approaches ,  and medical treatment plans
