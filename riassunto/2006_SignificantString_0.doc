-  In fact ,  the total worldwide value of mergers and acquisitions topped $2 


-  Strategically ,  that made sense because the new air carrier would have an enhanced national and international network of routes beyond that conveyed by the moniker America West 


-  Under such circumstances ,  the re-branding becomes part of  post-acquisition cleanup in which the driving question for marketing executives is ,  How are we now going to make this deal work? But by then ,  it may be too late ,  especially if employee morale ,  customer satisfaction and the new entitys share price have already plunged 


-  ,  Interestingly ,  current due-diligence processes during M&A negotiations are extremely adept at assessing tangible assets  ( such as property ,  plant ,  equipment and working capital )  and certain of the more concrete forms of intangible assets  ( such as contract rights and patents )  


-  With intangible assets representing close to 80% of the value of the Standard  Poors 500 ,  it is vital for the due-diligence process to include  comprehensive analysis of intangibles that encompasses relational assets  ( such as brands )  as well as the more obvious forms of intellectual property  ( such as copyrights and patents )  


-  Of course ,  many executives realize the importance of dealing with corporate branding issues early on ,  but despite their best intentions ,  they often have difficulty doing so because of the lack of  comprehensive tool to guide their thinking 


-  ,  To address that ,  we have developed  framework that considers the full range of branding options available along with the upsides and downsides of each with respect to three important constituencies: employees ,  customers and investors 


-  Conventional wisdom suggests that only  handful of branding alternatives exist for an M&A: adopt one brand ,  create some combination of the two brands ,  go with something entirely new or change nothing 


-  But our own work reveals that there are ,  in fact ,  at least 10 possibilities ,  some representing different but important variants  ( see Different Strategies for Branding  Merger )  


-  An important feature of our framework is that its approach is consistent with the mind-set inherent among executives negotiating  merger or acquisition 


-  These same considerations are at the core of our framework 


-  The appeal of this approach  ( which might be one reason for its popularity )  is its relative simplicity: The name and symbol of the target firm are simply replaced by those of the lead company 


-  Employees of the target company may also view the merger as an expansion of their career opportunities ,  while customers might perceive certain advantages to dealing with  larger company 


-   recent national study revealed that half of all mergers still generate significant dissatisfaction from customers even two years after completion of the transaction 


-  Because customers of the target firm never actually chose to switch ,  they can often experience  perceived loss of control and fear that they will have no voice within the new company 


-  In fact ,  that question is commonly posed by employees of both companies 


-  ,  Strategy  can be an effective way to signal  shared future for the two companies while maintaining  sense of identity and pride for each organizations employees  ( which is particularly important for those at the target firm )  


-  Employees of the lead company will appreciate the familiar moniker ,  while workers at the target firm will feel reassured that the acquirer is making some concessions ,  which could then encourage them to contribute to the culture and focus of the merged organization 


-  For customers of the lead company ,  strategy  sends strong signals that business will continue as before while also creating expectations for something new and different 


-  Customers of the target company ,  however ,  will need to be reassured that their history and past relationships will be honored  ( similar to the situation under strategy  )  


-  Although the merger-of-equals theme is  frequent proclamation at many M&A announcements ,  the post-transaction reality of most deals is quite different 


-  As one executive who has been involved in  merger that employed this strategy says ,  It feels like someone has moved into my house versus something new and better has been created 


-  ,  Because of those shortcomings ,  our belief is that companies should consider other ,  bolder ,  best of both approaches that leverage many of the advantages of strategy  while providing additional upsides 


-  ,  On the downside ,  customers often express concerns about  perceived reduction in power 


-  All these challenges need to be managed with effective pre- and post-transaction communications to the customers of both companies 


-  For investors ,  strategies  and  can leave lingering doubts about the realization of the synergies upon which the rationale for the merger was based 


-  As one investment analyst asks ,  Does one plus one equal three or something less than two? ,  In summary ,  strategies  and  both avoid the winner/loser perception inherent in the backing the stronger horse approaches ,  but they carry two additional and significant risks: loss of differentiation and lack of integration 


-  At the same time ,  strategy  leaves no doubt to investors about the intention to integrate the businesses ,  all while mitigating feelings of  winner/loser mind-set 


-  For these reasons ,  strategy  can ,  under the right circumstances ,  offer the advantages of the best of both and backing the stronger horse options 


-  To be effective ,  the endorser brand should be well known ,  and it needs to add value for the target brands audiences rather than simply acting as  mark of ownership 


-  wisely used Together with Nextel as an endorsement line ,  absorbing some of the good will associated with the Nextel brand and its push-to-talk technology 


-  ,  For employees ,  strategy  can lead to the sense of belonging to  larger group with new career opportunities 


-  Customers can also benefit with the reassurance of knowing that  strong parent now stands behind the acquired brand 


-  ,  Strategy  is perhaps the boldest approach ,  offering considerable upside if managed correctly 


-  The strategy sends  powerful message to employees ,  customers and investors that the merger has created  business and an opportunity that is greater than could have been realized by either of the companies independently 


-  The CEO ,  John McGrath ,  realized that even though the merger had created  truly global corporation ,  the mind-set of the two companies remained somewhat provincial 


-  As such ,  it is the most risky strategy ,  requiring an unwavering conviction for the need of  completely new brand 


-  For this reason ,  the branding implications are limited 


-  We believe that the answer to this lies not in incremental improvements to existing practices but rather in the extension of the due-diligence process to include  class of assets  ( namely ,  corporate brands )  that have hitherto been systematically overlooked 


-  During this time ,  relatively little attention is paid to deal makers  that is ,  those factors that will ,  post-merger ,  create value and enhance the likelihood of  smooth integration of the two organizations 


-  For that to happen ,  though ,  executives need first to understand the full range of corporate brand options and then select the right strategy ,  taking into account the various pros and cons for each of those three constituencies
