- The story of the IKEA Group ,  the worlds largest furniture retailer ,  is well known 


-  This highly successful company ,  based in lmhult ,  Sweden ,  operates 220 stores in 33 countries and has annual sales of 14 


-  It has emerged as  global player in one of the most fragmented industries in the world 


-  IKEA has been studied and used as an example by prominent business authors such as Michael Porter ,  Gary Hamel and Philip Kotler 


-  ,  In general ,  IKEAs success is attributed to the fact that the company has redefined  number of organizational practices in the furniture business 


-  Its use of global product sourcing and customer self-service results in low costs 


-  IKEA has  tendency to choose the cheapest suppliers ,  and customers pick up ,  transport and assemble most furniture purchases from IKEA themselves 


-   portion of IKEAs savings from low-cost components and customer self-service is then passed on to customers in the form of low prices 


-  In addition ,  well-designed furniture and an unusual shopping experience result in consumers perceiving that they receive superior value for money spent 


-  Although IKEAs products are simple ,  most of them benefit from high-quality Scandinavian design 


-  IKEAs huge stores provide plenty of amenities as well ,  such as coffee shops ,  restaurants and even child-care facilities 


-  ,  Although much has been written about IKEA ,  one topic has remained virtually unexplored 


-  How did IKEAs revolutionary strategy come about? While it is important for managers to study the content of successful strategies ,  it may be even more important to understand the process through which they are created 


-  An in-depth examination of the history of IKEA ,  which was founded in 1943 ,  reveals that many specifics of the companys strategy were not brought about through  process of deliberate formulation followed by implementation 


-  IKEAs specific strategy then emerged as he both proactively developed  viable course of action and reactively adapted to unfolding circumstances 


-  ,  In the academic literature ,  this approach is known as logical incrementalism 


-  According to the logical incrementalism perspective ,  actual strategic management practices have little resemblance to the rational and analytic approach to strategic planning that is frequently advocated 


-  In the real world ,  the processes used by managers to craft  strategy are often fragmented ,  evolutionary and largely intuitive 


-  However ,  proceeding incrementally  ( instead of trying to plan everything out in advance and then trying to implement this plan )  is not sufficient 


-   general sense of direction is also necessary to guide the organization and its employees 


-  Kamprad wrote them down in  company publication titled Testament of  Furniture Dealer 


-  The essence of IKEAs strategy ,  he wrote ,  consists of offering  wide range of well-designed ,  functional home furnishing products at prices that are so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them 


-  ,  Interestingly ,  the initial decision to sell furniture was an adaptation to the market rather than  more deliberate strategy 


-  In the late 1940s ,  IKEA was  mail-order company that sold  variety of consumer items such as Christmas cards ,  seeds ,  fountain pens ,  wallets and picture frames 


-  Kamprad introduced the first piece of furniture in his mail-order catalog to imitate  successful competitor 


-  It is only because that initial piece of furniture was  huge success that he decided to focus on furniture and ended up discontinuing all other products  few years later 


-  ,  Similarly ,  many of the other major strategic decisions Kamprad made were incremental moves that grew out of experimentation rather than out of  preplanned strategy 


-  For example ,  IKEA owes much of its success to furniture that customers assemble and to flat packages that can easily be stacked in  warehouse or carried in  car 


-  Indeed ,  IKEA could never achieve such  low-cost position if customers did not agree to take on some of the tasks usually performed by manufacturers and retailers ,  such as delivering furniture to their homes and assembling it 


-  ,  It was Gillis Lundgren ,  one of IKEAs first employees ,  who came up with the concept of ready-to-assemble furniture kits in 1953 


-  However ,  it would be wrong to assume that Lundgren envisioned  new division of labor among customers ,  manufacturers and retailers the first time he took the legs off  table 


-  At that time ,  IKEA was  mail-order company ,  and insurance companies were complaining that  high percentage of its furniture was damaged while being shipped to customers 


-  Hence ,  selling unassembled furniture that could be packed and shipped in flat boxes was  way both to reduce the damages that occurred during delivery and to lower shipping costs 


-  It was only when IKEA began opening stores that the potential of customer-assembled furniture and flat packages was fully tapped 


-  It turned out that customers could create value for themselves by taking on the delivery and the assembly of the furniture they bought 


-  ,  Another key driver of IKEAs low-cost structure is global sourcing of products 


-  IKEA currently works with  , 300 suppliers in 53 countries ,  but Kamprad made the pioneering decision to source furniture from communist Poland as early as 1961 


-  Since manufacturing costs were 50% lower in Poland than in Sweden ,  his decision looks brilliant in hindsight 


-  However ,  that decision ,  too ,  was an adaptation to market circumstances rather than an outgrowth of  formal strategic planning process 


-  ,  In the 1950s ,  Swedish furniture retailers and manufacturers had an agreement to keep prices high 


-  Because IKEAs strategy consisted of selling furniture at considerably lower prices than its competitors ,  the Swedish retail cartel gave local furniture manufacturers an ultimatum: Retailers would no longer buy from manufacturers that sold to IKEA 


-  Most manufacturers didnt dare defy the retail cartel and so refused to do business with IKEA 


-  Thus ,  looking for suppliers outside Sweden was the only way for Kamprad to overcome  boycott that could have led IKEA to bankruptcy 


-  At that time ,  doing business with communist countries was unusual 


-  However ,  IKEAs long-term contracts for large volumes at low prices happened to match perfectly the way the Polish furniture export organization ,  PAGED ,  worked at the time 


-  ,  Furniture design is another key element of IKEAs success ,  and it ,  too ,  evolved in response to external pressures 


-  Before requesting local manufacturers to boycott IKEA in the late 1950s ,  the Swedish retail cartel had asked them not to sell the same furniture to IKEA as to its competitors 


-  The aim of the retail cartel was to make it harder for customers to compare prices 


-  At that time ,  designing furniture at IKEA essentially consisted of slightly modifying existing models to help suppliers avoid the retail cartels boycott 


-  In retrospect ,  however ,  the decision to perform design in-house was one of the best moves ever made by IKEA 


-  First ,  Scandinavian design helps differentiate the companys merchandise 


-  Second ,  IKEAs furniture design style is also instrumental in keeping costs and prices low ,  in part because it is adapted to automated manufacturing 


-  ,  Even IKEAs unique retail environment is in many ways the result of experimentation 


-  Most of what constitutes  typical IKEA store emerged as an aggregation of successful innovations made around the world 


-  For instance ,  the origin of the companys in-store restaurants can be traced back to the coffee and buns that Kamprad promised to visitors if they came to the opening of the companys first store in lmhult ,  Sweden ,  in 1953 


-  At the time ,  Kamprad feared that people would be reluctant to travel to lmhult ,   remote Swedish city ,  and so he used coffee and buns as an incentive 


-  ,  In many cases ,  store managers were forced to innovate by events over which they had no control 


-  For instance ,  when the first large IKEA store opened in Stockholm on June 18 ,  1965 ,  there were so many customers that the warehouse could not handle them 


-  This shopping frenzy could partly be attributed to the fact that the Swedish government planned to introduce  value-added tax in July 1965 


-  In order to cope with the rush of customers eager to make purchases before the value-added tax took effect ,  the store manager decided to let customers pick up their purchases from the warehouse 


-  At the time ,  opening the warehouse to customers was totally unheard of 


-  The result was so successful that all future IKEA warehouses were designed to allow for customer self-service 


-  ,  Finally ,  it is worth noting that even the decision to open stores in the first place was the result of experimentation 


-  Until 1953 ,  IKEA was  mail-order business 


-  However ,  cutthroat competition in the Swedish mail-order industry was driving prices down ,  and some competitors were skimping on quality to increase their margins 


-  As  result ,  the image of the entire mail-order industry was being damaged 


-  Together with Sven Gte ,  an early IKEA employee ,  Kamprad came up with the concept of  showroom 


-  The idea was to provide customers with an opportunity to see the products before ordering them through the mail 


-  ,  Several useful insights can be gained from the story of how IKEAs strategy evolved 


-  Specifically ,  understanding the process of strategy formation at IKEA offers four important lessons about how  revolutionary strategy can be developed using an incremental approach 


-  ,  Most successful strategies are based on  clear vision 


-  Today ,  Kamprads vision of offering  wide range of well-designed ,  functional home furnishing products at prices that are so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them guides the way IKEA furniture is designed ,  manufactured and sold 


-  ,  While it is important to have  sense of direction from the outset ,  an incremental approach may also be used to improve  vision over time 


-  ,  While  clear ,  overarching vision is necessary ,  success largely depends on the specifics of the strategy 


-  In the case of IKEA ,  the vision of offering well-designed furniture at prices much lower than competitors was innovative 


-  However ,   small Swedish company would never have become the worlds largest furniture retailer if Kamprad and his team had not also come up with new ways of designing ,  manufacturing and selling furniture 


-  ,  As we have seen ,  many of the specifics of IKEAs strategy emerged through  process of trial and error 


-  Kamprad tested  large number of different approaches on  small scale 


-  If an approach did not work ,  he refrained from using it again 


-  For instance ,  more than 90% of the products sold by IKEA are currently sourced from outside suppliers 


- 11 ,  The decision not to be more involved in manufacturing was actually made in the 1960s 


-  At that time ,  IKEA owned  television manufacturer 


- 12 ,  When using  trial-and-error process to craft  strategy ,  it is crucial to develop  corporate culture that allows people to make mistakes 


- 13 ,  Importantly ,  some of IKEAs most groundbreaking ideas emerged when the company faced difficult challenges 


-  For instance ,  sourcing furniture from communist Poland at the height of the Cold War was  bold move ,  but it is highly unlikely that Kamprad would have made such  risky decision if Swedish furniture manufacturers had not boycotted his company 


-  ,  In the history of IKEA ,  there are many other examples of problems turned into opportunities 


-  For example ,   fire destroyed IKEAs flagship store in Stockholm on September  ,  1970 


-  The store was rebuilt with the concept of self-service ,  using all the experience gathered over the previous five years 


-  In fact ,  in its early years ,  IKEA so often had its back to the wall that considering threats as potential opportunities became  key element of the companys corporate culture 


-  As Kamprad puts it: In IKEAs business philosophy ,  the whole matter should be transcribed as  golden rule: Regard every problem as  possibility 


- 14 ,  Many people think that coming up with  new concept is  prerequisite for developing  revolutionary strategy 


-  For example ,  as noted earlier ,  selling ready-to-assemble furniture is  cornerstone of IKEAs strategy 


-  It was his employee ,  Gillis Lundgren ,  who had the idea of taking the legs off  table and putting them under the tabletop 


-  At least one other Swedish company used to sell furniture kits before IKEA introduced them in its mail-order catalog 


-  However ,  according to Kamprad ,  managers from the other company failed to recognize the potential of their new concept 


- 15 ,  The IKEA case provides  unique opportunity to shed light on an underexplored topic: How are revolutionary strategies created? While this question is fundamental ,  there are surprisingly few answers in the academic and managerial literatures 


-  The story of IKEA suggests that even revolutionary strategies such as the one crafted by Kamprad can be traced back to  variety of small actions and decisions that were often made serendipitously and in response to external circumstances 


-  ,  This approach is common in entrepreneurial companies 


-  Entrepreneurs are ,  in essence ,  individuals with  vision that is not always fully articulated but that serves as an inspiration and guiding idea 


-  However ,  an experimental and incremental approach to strategy formation can also be useful for established corporations 


-  No matter the age or size of  company ,  there is  tension in strategy formation between the desire to shape the future and the need to adapt to an unfolding reality 


-  Logical incrementalism is  very useful conceptual tool for reconciling these two conflicting needs
