- Let us assume that mastering the capabilities to learn and to collaborate  to manage knowledge and relationships  is the foundation for competitive success in the future 


-  Where should we turn for guidance in developing these skills? Which are the benchmarks ,  the best-practice leaders in the knowledge business ,  the firms whose source of competitive advantage resides in their capacity to tap the collective intelligence of members and to work together to create value for customers? ,  Those firms ,  we argue here ,  are professional service firms  ( PSFs )  they are lawyers ,  accountants ,  doctors ,  consultants ,  and investment bankers 


-  They represent the kinds of inverted organizations that have captured managers interest 


-  With their flat structures ,  service-oriented workforce ,  and participative decision processes ,  PSFs can provide  model toward which larger ,  more hierarchical organizations can turn for guidance as they become leaner ,  quicker ,  and more flexible 


-  PSFs represent  pure form of knowledge-based business when many leading business theorists are arguing that the management of collective knowledge and the ability to work together to translate that knowledge into customer value are the critical competencies for the future 


-  ,  We recently visited three leading professional service firms ,  each privately held partnerships recognized as outstanding performers in investment banking ,  law ,  and medicine ,  respectively 


-  We left these conversations believing that the organizations had mastered the capabilities for collaboration and learning that created value for the firms beyond the value of each individuals skills 


-  Those capabilities would allow them to sustain their success despite the significant changes in each field and provide  needed prototype for all organizations struggling to enhance and utilize their knowledge to broaden and deepen their customer relationships 


-  From our conversations ,  we framed  set of propositions about the similar ways in which all three firms achieved those capabilities ,  by creating  generative cycle of mutually reinforcing ,  self-sustaining employee and client development 


-  ,  This generative cycle succeeds despite the other characteristics that have made PSFs among the most difficult firms to manage  contentiousness and self-interest ,  fiefdoms ,  insensitivity to clients ,  exploitation of staff professionals ,  and slow ,  inefficient decision making 


-  How could the firms we studied bypass these obstacles to create new models of management for all organizations? Our thesis is that the capabilities that the generative cycle of reinforcing behaviors creates allowed them to minimize and overcome the dysfunctional behaviors often accompanying diffused ,  democratized decision making 


-  These behaviors include the self-interest that sometimes dominates both firmwide and client-specific interests and consensus-based processes that can hinder action 


-  The elements of the generative cycle that overcome these obstacles are specific capabilities in the development of individual professionals and clients that fuse the professionals interests with the firms interests 


-  Hence ,  there is significant interest in organizational learning in writings by both practitioners and academics 


-  Nowhere is the potential strategic value of learning more evident than in professional services 


-  Yet individual learning is merely  precondition for the kind of organizational learning that the partners in the PSFs we studied saw as the source of their competitive advantage 


-  Next ,   capacity for collaborative learning unleashes the creativity involved in joint exploration of solutions that transcend technical boundaries and define tomorrows possibilities 


-  Even the ability to collaborate to achieve single-loop learning of an incremental nature is valuable; transformed by leveraging diverse perspectives into double-loop learning that reexamines fundamental assumptions ,  it can add tremendous value ,  especially in changing environments 


-  Processes for recruiting ,  developing ,  and retaining professional staff develop  capability for collaborative learning ,  which ,  in turn ,  produces valued outcomes for clients ,  which further support professional development 


-  Taken alone ,  none of the elements of the cycle are remarkable; in conjunction ,  however ,  they produce extraordinary results  ( see Figure  )  


-  The key elements of the model are  (  )  the process through which ,  and the context within which ,   firm enhances and extends individual expertise through collaboration ,  and  (  )  the process through which  firm leverages individual learning to create  capacity for collaborative learning 


-  Despite the pressure ,  due to their growth ,  to hire many people at the same time ,  one partner spoke of the importance of hiring candidates carefully: ,  The quality of the person hired is the single most important thing in my mind 


-  Again ,   go back to the business principles  putting the clients interest first ,  operating as  team ,  making sure that you subordinate your own interests to the firms 


-  ,  All three firms looked for analytic talent to do the technical work ,  human qualities to do the relationship work ,  and entrepreneurial instincts to do the organization-building work 


-  ,  Analytic talent was not hard to find and identify among the many bright prospects seeking positions at the firms 


-  The qualities for the relationship work   combination of interpersonal skills and personal qualities of integrity and respect  were essential to developing what one partner called team consciousness 


-  For example ,  the partners at the medical firm ,  in looking for this quality ,  asked support staff who answered prospective physicians phone calls to comment on the respect with which they were treated by the candidates 


-  The firms thought entrepreneurial instincts were manifested in an inquisitive ,  energetic mind that saw and recognized opportunity ,  skills likely to translate that opportunity into new business and the motivation to do so 


-  ,  There was also  high degree of consistency between the qualities the firms looked for when promoting people to partner and those they looked for in new hires ,  although the emphasis gradually moved toward the entrepreneurial and relationship work as they expected the technical skills had become  given 


-  The firms expected partners ,  in particular ,  to move from merely working with others to energizing others by example and interactions 


-   law partner asked us ,  Isnt one of the great tests whether or not the people that you care most about in the organization will be motivated or demotivated by seeing an individual made partner? ,  Another important criterion for partnership selection was  capacity to continue to grow and learn 


-  ,  Thus the selection process began with clear criteria that focused on qualities designed to make collaboration work in the long term: capable ,  trustworthy colleagues ,  with high potential for personal growth ,  who were oriented toward working together and committed to thinking ,  at an organizationwide level ,  about the firms business 


-  One founding partner in the law firm remarked: ,  Ive always viewed the objective of the firm as identifying what is the highest and best use of the people that you have 


-  ,  This willingness to invest was ,  in turn ,  based on beliefs about the reciprocal commitment of the individual to the firm and the benefits to the firm as  result 


-  That sets things on  very even plane ,  in terms of cooperating ,  interacting ,  and cross-selling ,  which is very crucial 


-  ,  Senior partners willingness to personally invest in the growth of new hires was always present 


-  One investment banker remarked: ,  It has to be constant talking about this ,  constantly going from abstractions down to day-to-day examples so people can see how the core principles apply 


-  In terms of things like integrity or conflict avoidance ,  managers have to give constant seminars on day-to-day work 


-  Not in  classroom setting ,  but in brainstorming with their younger associates on how  particular situation was handled 


-  ,  Moreover ,  professional development at the PSFs did not end when  person became partner 


-  The responsibility to maintain value remains throughout  career 


-  An investment banker commented: ,  You cannot create an environment in which someone can sit and use up space ,  if you will ,  and not really add significant value 


-  Senior managements willingness to retire partners who are not contributing at the level they once did is  very important ingredient in adding to the enthusiasm and incentive of the younger people 


-  Everyone here is evaluated by people senior to them ,  junior to them ,  and their peers ,  one investment banking partner explained ,  and partners have the same kind of evaluation process 


-   senior physician described its purpose: It doesnt go into your file or into your compensation; its just  tool for learning ,  for asking How am  doing as  provider of caring service? ,  Throughout development ,  firm members believed they were both learners and teachers: according to one law partner ,  top performers and role models were elevated to  platform ,  not  pedestal ,  where others could join because everyone was expected to help elevate each others performance 


-   senior investment banking partner described the relationship between the development experiences of professionals and the ability to retain them: ,  People have to feel that they are being assessed fairly and given thoughtful feedback ,  and that the people who are responsible for their careers are genuinely helping them develop their potential 


-   founding partner in the law firm captured this pervasive theme: ,  The way an institution becomes excellent is if the partners like being partners 


-  If its just the career path they chose or they feel protected by  strong institution and have  good income ,  thats not only bad for them  its terrible for the institution 


-  ,  Loyalty developed from the firms developmental focus but was also due to  sense of stewardship   belief in and commitment to something that each partner saw as meaningful beyond his or her own interests  that encompassed clients ,  colleagues ,  and the firm itself 


-   retired investment banking partner likened it to preserving Buckingham Palace for future generations: ,  It wasnt only our firm 


-  Weve always had that attitude toward building ,  growing ,  and protecting the firm 


-  One physician recalled his initial interview at the medical center ,  almost twenty years earlier: ,  I remember distinctly  three-hour conversation that  had with an oncologist whod been president of the group for years 


-  We arent just here to see patients and send bills and make the most money that we can make 


-  These values created  sense of unity and coherence that simplified the complexities inherent in working within the firms often complicated organizational structures 


-  The director of the medical center explained: ,  Most of our decision making is consensus and not voting 


-  That doesnt mean that everybody agrees with everything ,  but it means there is sufficient understanding and dialogue so people see the broader picture 


-  ,  At each firm ,  respect for others opinions was key 


-  An investment banker remarked: ,  Its very ,  very important that people here respect each others opinion and consider it ,  and that they work toward consensus and things dont get polarized 


-  Even when  majority of the executive committee feels strongly about  subject ,  if theres  minority position thats not irrational and has  strong base of intellectual support ,  thats usually the opinion that sways ,  even at the risk of losing the competitive advantage of moving very quickly 


-  ,  Partners frequently referred to their concern about the inability to act quickly ,  but they saw it as  necessary trade-off to protect dialogue 


-  An investment banker said: ,  In  partnership ,  you need the goodwill of the other partners to make the right kinds of decisions 


-  If you build consensus the right way ,  youre potentially stronger ,  and it affects the way that the whole place operates 


-  ,  The quality of collaboration resulting from the consensus process paid dividends ,  as the complexity of products expanded 


-  The managing partner of the investment bank explained: ,  A large proportion of our products and services requires more teamwork than we could have imagined five ,  ten ,  or fifteen years ago 


-  If every time you deliver  product to people ,  you have turf warfare ,  sharp elbows ,  and transfer-pricing debates ,  you will be much slower ,  your reaction time will be much slower than competitors ,  and youre on the slippery slope to failure 


-  It doesnt serve any customers best interest to sit around haggling about how  dollar gets sliced up around the firm 


-   few were more interesting 


-  ,  For partners ,  shared values ,  sense of enjoyment ,  stewardship ,  equitable reward system ,  and inclusive decision processes together created significant barriers to exit 


-  They produced an environment in which an individual could use the larger network to reach outcomes not possible when acting alone or within less connected ,  less capable firms 


-  This ,  in turn ,  created marketplace outcomes that made the relationship financially rewarding and professionally satisfying for all 


-  These capabilities become strategically significant because they contribute superior value to clients ,  are not easily matched by rivals ,  and speed the firms ongoing adaptation to environmental change 


-  They ,  of course ,  provide the more standardized services as well ,  but none of the partners we spoke with felt that their firms enjoyed significantly superior advantages in these areas; it was in handling complexity that they felt they excelled 


-  The law firm ,  for example ,  was known for integrating product liability issues with its bankruptcy practice; the physician practice ,  for integrating across all its medical specialties 


-  We identified issues running from pure litigation strategy ,  to bankruptcy considerations ,  to civil and criminal forfeiture law ,  tax law ,  and corporate securities 


-  We were successful in part because we brought all those resources together and focused them on one person ,  as opposed to sending six people to the  


-  ,  Thus the central asset of the firms is not the individual technical expertise of their members; that is merely  precondition at these firms 


-  Rather ,  the collective wisdom of their multidisciplinary teams sets them apart 


-  ,  The capacity to work together rested on an individual willingness to learn and  belief that no one had all the answers 


-  When collaboration facilitates learning at organizational and individual levels ,  the solutions tend to be more innovative and more integrated 


-  Many researchers have argued that shared problem solving leads to greater creativity 


-  Otherwise ,  the ability to create new knowledge is limited by organizational routines ,  individual expertise ,  and biased interpretation of the potential value of new possibilities 


-  ,  Enjoyment in the work itself that we spoke of earlier also seemed to contribute to members willingness to engage in creative conversation 


-  One lawyer remarked: ,  The people working here find the work challenging and interesting 


-  As  result ,  if you approach them with  novel or interesting way to handle  problem ,  they start off by being interested in it 


-  Theres support for people developing new practices even though it takes them away from doing the things that produce good short-term results 


-  ,  The president of the medical center expressed  similar view: ,  We give people time to focus on their work 


-  ,  The capability for collaboration ,  extended to  capability for organizational learning ,  is nurtured through professional development processes and leveraged into value for clients 


-  The breadth of expertise that the firms made seamlessly available to clients allowed them to develop broader ,  deeper relationships with them 


-  If you can do that ,  you create  different relationship with your client 


-  Specialists are seen as specialists who can be replaced with other specialists 


-  We want to become advisers to our clients 


-  One investment banker remarked: ,  Weve tried very hard to have  relationship approach and  transaction capability 


-  So every client has someone ,  usually  group ,  but certainly one person who is charged with managing that relationship and knows everything about the client and its needs ,  objectives ,  and idiosyncrasies 


-  That relationship manager or team is our first and foremost line of attack so the client never sees business units or P&Ls or departments or divisions 


-  All the client sees is  team of experts ,  each of whom is trying to contribute  piece to the puzzle 


-  An investment banker said: In this firm ,  its more difficult to try to establish or protect or defend or segregate turf than it is to forget about all those issues and just say ,  Heres the problem 


-  We have  triple-layered matrix management system 


-  By grabbing this process ,  we were better able to create the chain reaction that occurs when  woman has symptomatic breast problems 


-  The best clients for  professional services firm ,  we suggest ,  are those with the most complex problems who are willing to invest in state-of-the-art solutions and ,  in so doing ,  push each professional to new levels of expertise 


-  One law partner described the relationship between his clients issues and his professional development: ,  My goal is to be recognized as someone at the top ,  at the cutting edge of the business reorganization and bankruptcy practice 


-  In addition ,  because the number of competitors able to solve new ,  complex problems effectively and efficiently is more limited than the number offering standardized solutions ,  the risk of margin erosion is less 


-  In much the same way as in the high-tech industry ,   given firm can avoid commoditization of its products only if it can continually create enhanced solutions that deliver  better price/performance ratio to its clients 


-  ,   firms ability to enhance its capability to deliver these kinds of solutions depends on clients willingness to bring it problems for which either current solutions are inadequate or no solution exists 


-   senior partner in the law firm explained: ,  My firms clients tend to develop new kinds of problems that ,  if youre intellectually interested ,  constantly reinvigorate the field 


-  ,  The collaborative capacity for boundary crossing is more difficult for competitors to replicate than individually-based expertise and ,  hence ,  is considerably more valuable not only to customers but also to the firm itself in sustaining advantage 


-  Development processes based on mentoring cannot be grafted onto firms with uninterested partners 


-  The most gifted professionals will always have many options to go elsewhere 


- 12 Talented people can always be wooed from one firm to another 


-  ,  Another benefit of the generative cycle is the increasingly valuable ,  enhanced ability for successfully adapting to  changing marketplace 


-  These firms are Mintzbergs adhocracies ,  which bring together individuals pursuing their own professional interests ,  whose allegiance to the firm is sublimated to their allegiance to their profession and own interests 


-  Here ,  again ,  the capability for collaborative learning that we noted in the firms in our study benefits their management and their clients 


-  The quality of the relationships across the formal structure allows for the continual reconfiguration of work groups ,  as demands necessitate 


-  Because of their mind-sets and their T-shaped skills ,  individuals move in and out of these webs with an alacrity not found in their more narrowly focused competitors 


-  ,  The same context and processes that sustain collaboration and learning about client issues also sustain it for internal management issues 


-  The capacity for collaboration relies on mutual respect ,  openness ,  and trust; on an ability and desire to maintain an open dialogue; on shared goals and an interest in  common stewardship; and on systems that foster and reward teamwork 


-  The capacity for learning relies on different contextual factors   willingness to be self-critical ,   belief that one doesnt have all the answers ,  and  commitment to lifelong development 


-  Taken together ,  these qualities create an institutional capacity for flexibility and responsiveness that greatly enhances the firms ability to have  sense of their future ,  to be patient in searching for consensus ,  and to reengineer themselves as necessary to adapt to changing circumstances 


- 15 Such communities are fundamentally and simultaneously concerned with producing both practical outcomes for customers and learning for members 


-  The nature of learning ,  proponents of this view contend ,  requires participation in doing ,  shared perspectives about doing ,  and mutual development of both the individuals and the collectives capabilities in the process 


-  ,  Thus  business organization as  community of practice is one held together by  shared concern for both the outcomes it achieves for customers and its members personal development and learning 


-  In fact ,  it sees the two as inseparable in that increased capabilities at the organizational level flow from development at the individual level 


-  ,  Much of the power of the community-of-practice metaphor lies in its ability to move beyond the traditional dichotomies that we have often accepted in management  the decoupling of who we are from what we do or of the work from the person ,  the juxtaposition of shareholders and employees ,  and the tension between caring for and respecting individuals and insisting they change 


-  Perhaps most prominently ,   focus on  community of practice refuses to see individuals interests at odds with those of the organization 


-  Yet ,  in doing so ,  community of practice challenges the organization to find the shared purpose that links individual development with institutional direction in  far more reciprocal way than the old dictum of whats good for the firm is good for the employee 


-  Historically ,  communities of practice have evolved; no one has consciously created them 


-  They resist management as we generally think of it; instead they require value-driven leadership by members 


-  Like so many other attempts to implement fundamentally value-driven initiatives  ( total quality management is  good example )  ,  piecemeal attempts at imitating its techniques will fail 


-  It is the whole cloth that one must purchase ,  and this requires embracing  set of values that have not traditionally been part of business 


-  They create value for their clients by caring more about client issues than internal politics ,  sharing their knowledge with each other as efficiently as possible ,  and constantly looking for better ways to solve their clients tough problems 


-  ,  This should be simple ,  except that firms have gotten it so wrong for so long by hiring people without concern for their long-term fit with the businesss principles ,  by treating them as commodities ,  by denying them  voice in decisions that affect them ,  and by giving them reason to leave for more lucrative offers 


-  Firms have failed customers in similar ways  by caring more for their own comfort than client issues ,  by guarding turf and creating inefficient hand-offs ,  and by targeting the easy problems and convenient answers 


-  Such  process begins ,  we believe ,  with value-driven leaders willing to fundamentally reexamine organizational capabilities ,  values ,  and practices and ask ,  What kind of firm are we committed to being? ,  The PSFs traditional areas of weakness  narrow specialists who see only their own solutions ,  self-centered egoists unwilling or unable to collaborate with colleagues ,  fragmented perspectives and interest group politics that stymie institutional change  are the areas in which the firms studied have found their sources of sustainable advantage 


-  The people in the firms have the self-confidence and independence that such demanding professional work with clients demands ,  yet they remain willing to acknowledge their need to learn from and rely on each other 


-  They encourage calculated risk taking and innovation ,  yet they do not sacrifice quality ,  reliability ,  speed ,  or efficiency
