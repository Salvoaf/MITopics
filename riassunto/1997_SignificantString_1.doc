-  He realized that by producing only one car model ,  he could keep prices low and pay good wages to workers 


-  Thus there is  great deal of anxiety when and if family members consider violating the founders core business idea 


-  ,  For example ,  before Walt Disney died ,  he hand-picked  triumvirate to succeed him ,  composed of his son-in-law and two trusted colleagues 


-  Second ,  it is extremely difficult to sell any business since each brother is occupied with running his business and is therefore attached to it ,  regardless of its performance 


-  ,  Second- and later generation family members ,  particularly when they are not business employees ,  frequently want to diversify their holdings to protect their wealth 


-  They also find it hard to trust and authorize  sibling or cousin in the same way that they imagine trusting their own father or mother 


-  For example ,  when Dodo Hamilton ,   third-generation member of the Dorrance family and an heiress to the Campbell Soup fortune ,  considered selling her stock ,  she noted ,  After  lot of really heart-wrenching crying ,   came to the conclusion ,  this would be the best for my family 


-  ,  The dynamically conservative character of family business ,  in which change seems to occur but is ,  in fact ,  narrowly constrained by the weight of the past ,  suggests that we need to develop distinctive tools for and approaches to the task of strategic development 


-  Moreover ,  we cannot only employ the best technical planning methodologies for improving the firm leaders understanding; we also have to address the emotions they feel when they provide leadership 


-  We believe that any strategic planning approaches suited to family businesses should meet these criteria: ,  As these criteria infer ,  in planning its future ,   family business must accept and integrate normal family processes into business planning 


-   ( Certainly ,  we can consider negotiating  succession transition among family members at least as potentially conflictual as  marketing negotiation 


-  Mental models ,  Senge notes ,  determine not only how we make sense of the world ,  but how we take action 


-  Such learning ,  because it derives from both rational and emotional experiences ,  deepens participants understanding of their situation 


-  By working on cases ,  people can develop  rich understanding of certain principles and concepts ,  but because cases fail to engage them in action ,  they do not discover their own unverbalized beliefs that can inhibit them from applying what they learn 


- 11 People make  leap of trust in which they agree ,  for  certain time period ,  to suspend inhibition and take up tasks that ,  under ordinary circumstances ,  they might consider silly or of uncomfortably uncertain outcome 


-  Use of simulation tools implies  certain relationship and contract with  consultant in which such trust is aimed at supporting development 


-  We used artifactual memos and articles and role playing to embed the customary financial and strategy studies in family members experiences  to take planning from the abstract to the virtually real 


-  We do not want to divert attention from learning by providing details that distract from the overall objective ,  which is to support decision makers in reasoned ,  thoughtful choices 


-  What ,  in fact ,  was his role ,  interest ,  and future? ,  In turn ,  McGinn ,  age forty-two ,  had had industry experience before joining the firm eight years earlier ,  had  good working relationship with the CEO ,  but was nonetheless uncertain about his future in the business 


-  They wanted the already large firm to double operating income in less than ten years 


-  It became clear that if they wished to meet their objectives ,  they would have to develop more sophisticated relationships with one another and with others as well 


-  In particular ,  the COO and the son and daughter needed to understand better how they could and should work together to grow the newer business 


-  ,  In the last phase ,  we wanted the family members and McGinn to understand and experience the character of the working relationships they would need in the future 


-  We believed that they had come to appreciate ,  in an objective sense ,  that they had to be more interdependent 


-  We wanted to move from the abstract to the concrete 


-  They realized that the documents were not real ,  but the emotional impact of the press release immediately deepened their sense of the stakes involved in planning for the firms future 


-  In preparing for the meeting with the supplier   meeting in which the three had never participated together because the COO managed important supplier relationships with clear authorization from the CEO  they realized that they had to define their respective roles 


-  Who would take the lead? How would the others support the leader? What rationale could they use for their decisions? ,  The meeting with the supplier did not go well 


-  McGinn ,  expecting to be comfortable due to his longstanding relationship with the supplier ,  saw little need to prepare the others and believed he could carry the meeting on his own 


-  Trout ,  who had ambivalent feelings about their success together ,  nonetheless realized that to preserve and enhance the business ,  he had to encourage the three to work together 


-  Each confronted the eventual certainty of the CEOs retirement 


-  If they were to reach their shared targets ,  they had to reconsider their roles ,  while creating more sophisticated interpersonal relationships 


-  Each assumed  new role ,  thereby increasing everyones sense of commitment to new working relationships 


-  ,  The analytic steps we used in the case helped the four owner/employees understand and ground ,  in the reality of the numbers ,  their shared objectives 


-  Tom Dewey was the CEO of Colonial Designs ,   family-owned company that manufactures and distributes distinctive tableware and flatware 


-  In his thirty-eight years as head of the business ,  he extended its product line and restructured its manufacturing ,  but his real achievement was developing  world-class distribution system ,  sustainably better than any competitors 


-  He feared ,  therefore ,  that the familys quite substantial wealth might dissipate after his retirement 


-  ,  In reviewing Deweys initial request for consulting ,  we realized that we could not treat this assignment as simply technical 


-  Moreover ,  in talking to Dewey and interviewing other members ,  we realized how much feeling and memory they brought to their role as the businesss owners 


-  ,  We wanted to understand family members feelings ,  attitudes ,  and expectations for the business 


-  Did they see it as one potential investment among many that they owned? One that produced both income and capital appreciation? What was their psychological relationship to the business? Was it intertwined with their identity as individuals and  family ,  or did they see it simply as  business with products ,  markets ,  and  potential growth path? ,  We found that ,  in fact ,  members were pleased with the business and its enormous success ,  they were satisfied with the predictable dividends they received  ( dividend policy was geared to promoting business growth and producing current income for the owners )  ,  and they experienced the business as  part of their family life and individual identities 


-  ,  Dewey ,  we believed ,  protected them from the businesss uncertainties and potential 


-  Moreover ,  their passivity and dependency were matched by Deweys own uncertainty 


-  As our objective was to help Dewey and the family develop their capacity to choose among  range of futures ,  we developed several scenarios 


-  These longtime advisers had not worked together as  group ,  but their mandate was to provide coordinated counsel to Dewey ,  who trusted them 


-  Dewey thought about his own core values ,  unhurried by family members anxiety ,  and the family confronted difficult choices while knowing that Dewey would continue to support and guide them 


-  First ,  they realized that they could never sell to  foreign company 


-  They believed deeply that their company had grown because the United States was bountiful and had provided family members with full lives 


-  They did not want to create income for people who might not share that love and commitment 


-  Third ,  they realized that ,  paradoxically ,  to retain the business ,  they had to take Deweys retirement seriously 


-  ,  At the family meetings ,  all family members learned something 


-  After writing them off ,  he was now forced to reconsider and told them so 


-  Their fears that creating  unified shareholder group to express their concerns or differing family interests would lack cohesion were unrealized 


-  ,  To be effective ,  such simulations should emerge from an ongoing consulation in which participants grow to trust not only the consultant but also each other 


-  There needs to be enough suspension of reality to take the heat off of learning through experience  ( in which mistakes can be made )  and enough connection to reality that some sense of the stakes remains 


-  As companies increasingly reconsider their basic strategies  what business are we in and how do we add value  they uncover fundamental issues of identity
