- Its hard to pick up  current business publication without reading about the imperative to change 


-  Left silent in these arguments is which organizations will drive that change and how they will do it 


-  Academic research suggests that the ability to incorporate new ideas and technologies into existing ways of doing things plays  big role in separating leaders from the rest of the pack ,  and studies clearly show that it is easier to manage  sequence of bite-sized changes than one huge reorganization or change initiative 


-  But ,  while many organizations strive for continuous change and learning ,  few actually achieve those goals on  regular basis 


-  Two of the authors have studied and tried to make change for more than two decades ,  but it was  frustrating meeting that opened our eyes to one of the keys to leading the pack rather than constantly trying to catch up 


-  ,  In the late 1990s ,  one of the authors ,  Don Kieffer ,  was ready to launch  big change initiative: implementing the Toyota production system in one of Harley-Davidson Inc 


-  On the appointed day ,  Mr 


-  Oba arrived ,  took  tour of the plant ,  and then returned to Dons office ,  where Don started asking questions: When do we start? What kind of results should  expect? How much is it going to cost me? But ,  Mr 


-  Oba wouldnt answer those questions 


-  He was ready to spend money and he had one of the worlds experts on the Toyota production system in his office ,  but the expert  ( Mr 


-  Oba )  wouldnt tell Don how to get started 


-  Oba ,  tired of not getting an answer to his question ,  eventually walked out of Dons office 


-  Oba was trying to teach Don one of the foundational skills in leading effective change: formulating  clear problem statement 


-  Obas visit ,  two of the authors have studied and worked with dozens of organizations and taught over  , 000 executives 


-  We have helped organizations with everything from managing beds in  cardiac surgery unit to sequencing the human genome 


-  Based on this experience ,  we have come to believe that problem formulation is the single most underrated skill in all of management practice 


-  ,  There are few questions in business more powerful than What problem are you trying to solve? In our experience ,  leaders who can formulate clear problem statements get more done with less effort and move more rapidly than their less-focused counterparts 


-  Clear problem statements can unlock the energy and innovation that lies within those who do the core work of your organization 


-  But ,  when making change ,  neglecting to formulate  clear problem statement often prevents innovation and leads to wasted time and money 


-  In this article ,  we hope to both improve your problem formulation skills and introduce  simple method for solving those problems 


-   large and growing collection of research indicates that it is useful to distinguish between two modes of thinking ,  which psychologists and cognitive scientists sometimes call automatic processing and conscious processing  ( also sometimes known as system  and system  )  


-  When you are aware that you are thinking about something ,  you are using conscious processing 


-  With this ability ,  humans can innovate and learn in ways not available to other species 


-  ,  Automatic processing works differently from its conscious counterpart 


-  You cannot directly instruct your automatic processing functions to do something; instead ,  they constitute  kind of back office for your brain 


-  When  piece of long-sought-after information just pops into your head ,  hours or days after it was needed ,  you are experiencing the workings of your automatic processing functions 


-  In contrast ,  the automatic system works based on what is known as association or pattern matching 


-  When confronted with  problem ,  the automatic processor tries to match that current challenge to  previous situation and then uses that past experience as  guide for how to act 


-  For example ,  the automatic processing functions are the only parts of the brain capable of processing information quickly enough to return  serve in tennis or hit  baseball 


-  Psychologist Gary Klein has documented how experienced professionals who work under intense time pressure ,  like surgeons and firefighters ,  use their past experience to make split-second decisions 


-  Successful people in these environments rely on deep experience to almost immediately link the current situation to the appropriate action 


-  ,  However ,  because it relies on patterns identified from experience ,  automatic processing can bias us toward the status quo and away from innovative solutions 


-  It should come as little surprise that breakthrough ideas and technologies sometimes come from relative newcomers who werent experienced enough to know better 


-  Research suggests that innovations often result from combining previously disparate perspectives and experiences 


-  Furthermore ,  the propensity to rely on previous experiences can lead to major industrial accidents like Three Mile Island if  novel situation is misread as an established pattern and therefore receives the wrong intervention 


-  As we have all experienced ,  sometimes when confronting  hard problem ,  you need to step away from it for  while and think about something else 


-  Unconscious mental processes may be better able to combine divergent ideas to create new innovations 


-  After the flash of insight ,  conscious attention is again needed to evaluate the resulting combinations 


-  ,  When the brains associative machine is confronted with  problem ,  it jumps to  solution based on experience 


-  To complement that fast thinking with  more deliberate approach ,  structured problem-solving entails developing  logical argument that links the observed data to root causes and ,  eventually ,  to  solution 


-  Creating an effective logical chain starts with  clear description of the problem and ,  in our experience ,  this is where most efforts fall short 


- 11 If you fall into the trap of initially focusing your attention on peripheral issues for practice ,  chances are you will never get around to the work you really need to do 


-  Decades of research suggest that people work harder and are more focused when they face clear ,  easy-to-understand goals 


- 12 More recently ,  psychologists have shown that mentally comparing  desired state with the current one ,   process known as mental contrasting ,  is more likely to lead people to change than focusing only on the future or on current challenges 


- 13 Recent work also suggests that people draw considerable motivation from the feeling of progress ,  the sense that their efforts are moving them toward the goal in question 


-  Being able to measure the gap between the current state and your target precisely will support an effective project 


-  However ,  structured problem-solving can be successfully applied to settings that do not yield immediate and precise measurements ,  because many attributes can be subjectively quantified even if they cannot be objectively measured 


-  For example ,  many organizations struggle with so-called soft variables like customer satisfaction and employee trust 


-  Moreover ,  once you start digging into an issue ,  you often discover ways to measure things that werent obvious at the outset 


-  For example ,   recent project by  student in our executive MBA program tackled an unproductive weekly staff meeting 


-  The student began his project by creating  simple web-based survey to capture the staffs perceptions of the meeting ,  thus quickly generating quantitative data 


-  You will learn more and make faster progress if you do 12 one-month projects instead of one 12-month project 


-  ,  To appropriately scope projects ,  we often use the scope-down tree ,   tool we learned from our colleague John Carrier ,  who is  senior lecturer of system dynamics at MIT 


-  )  ,  Managers we work with often generate great results when they have the discipline to scope down their projects to an area where they can ,  say ,  make  30% improvement in 60 days 


-  This kind of small wins strategy has been discussed by  variety of organizational scholars ,  but it remains rarely practiced 


-  In our experience ,  this mistake tends to reinforce existing disputes and often worsens functional turf wars 


-  If you can solve that instance of the problem ,  you will be well on your way to changing your organization for the better 


-  While it is often difficult to formulate  clear statement of the challenges you face ,  it is much easier to critique other peoples efforts ,  because you dont have the same experiences and are less invested in  particular outcome 


-  Structured problem-solving is nothing more than the essential elements of the scientific method  an iterative cycle of formulating hypotheses and testing them through controlled experimentation repackaged for the complexity of the world outside the laboratory 


-  Edwards Deming and his mentor Walter Shewhart ,  the grandfathers of total quality management ,  were perhaps the first to realize that this discipline could be applied on the factory floor 


-  Since Demings work ,  several variants of structured problem-solving have been proposed ,  all highlighting the basic value of iterating between articulating  hypothesis ,  testing it ,  and then developing the next hypothesis 


-  In our experience ,  making sure that you use  structured problem-solving method is far more important than which particular flavor you choose 


-  ,  In the last two decades ,  we have done projects using all of the popular methods and supervised and coached over  , 000 student projects using them 


-  Our work has led to  hybrid approach to guiding and reporting on structured problem-solving that is both simple and effective 


-  We capture our approach in  version of Toyotas famous A3 form that we have modified to enable its use for work in settings other than manufacturing 


-  to support knowledge sharing in its factories by summarizing  structured problem-solving effort in  single page 


-  Though the form may often have supporting documentation ,  restricting the project summary to  single page forces the user to be very clear in his or her thinking 


-  ,  The next step in the A3 process is to document the current design of the process by observing the work directly 


-  Due to automatic processing ,  most people ,  particularly those who do repetitive tasks ,  cannot accurately describe how they actually execute their work 


-  ,  Because those who do the work often cannot fully describe what they do ,  you as  manager must get as close to the locus of the problem as you can and watch the work being done 


-  Taiichi Ohno ,  one of the founding fathers of the Toyota production system ,  developed the Gemba walk  ( Gemba is  Japanese word that roughly translates to the real place )  as  means for executives to find out what really happens on  day-to-day basis 


-  The goal is to understand how the work is really done 


-  This could mean watching  nurse and  doctor perform  medical procedure ,  engineers in  design meeting ,  or salespeople interacting with  customer 


-  ,  Senior executives are often quite removed from the day-to-day work of the organizations that they lead 


-  Consequently ,  observing and thoroughly understanding the current state of the work often suggests easy opportunities for improvement 


-  We give our students the following rule of thumb to guide their efforts: When you go see the work ,  if you arent embarrassed by what you find ,  you probably arent looking closely enough 


-  The investigation ,  however ,  revealed that for this type of invoice ,  the code was always the same; each invoice spent several days waiting for  piece of information that could have been printed on the form in advance! ,  Observing the work closely often shakes loose  variety of preconceptions 


-  ,  There are  variety of techniques and frameworks to guide  root cause analysis 


- 18 Since then ,  just about all structured problem-solving methods have offered one or more variants of the same basic method for digging into  problems source 


- 19 ,  The purpose of all root-cause approaches is to help the user understand how the observed problem is rooted in the existing design of the work system 


-  Unfortunately ,  this type of systems thinking does not come naturally 


-  Solving the immediate problem will do nothing to prevent future manifestations unless we address the system-level cause 


-  ,   good root-cause analysis should build on your investigation to show how the work system you are analyzing generates the problem you are studying as  part of normal operations 


-  If the root-cause analysis identifies  series of special events that are unlikely to happen again ,  you havent dug deeply enough 


-  For example ,  customer service hiccups often differ from instance to instance and are easily attributed to things that are once in  lifetime and could never happen again 


-  Digging deeper ,  however ,  might reveal  flawed training process for those in customer-facing jobs or an inconsistent customer on-boarding process 


-  ,  Once you have linked features of the work system to the problem you are trying to solve ,  use the Target Design section of the A3 form to propose an updated system to address the problem 


-  Often the necessary changes will be simple 


- 20 In the Target Design section ,  you should map out the structure of an updated work system that will function more effectively 


-  This might be as simple as saying that from now on we will print the general ledger code on the invoice form or something more complicated ,  such as changes to training and on-boarding programs 


-  The needed changes will rarely be an entirely new program or initiative 


-  Dont try to solve everything at once; propose the minimum set of changes that will help you make rapid progress toward your goal 


-  First ,  create an improvement goal   prediction about how much improvement your proposed changes will generate 


-  If your problem is 24% of our service interactions do not generate  positive response from our customers ,  greatly exceeding our target of 5% or less ,  then an improvement goal might be reduce the number of negative service interactions by 50% in 60 days 


-  Guidelines are the guardrails for executing the project; they represent boundaries or constraints that cannot be violated 


-  For example ,  the leadership guidelines for  project focused on cost reduction might specify that the project should identify an innovation that reduces cost without making trade-offs in quality 


-  Be sure that the plan is broken into  set of clear and distinct activities  ( for example ,  have the invoice form reprinted with the general ledger code or hold  daily meeting to review quality issues )  and that each activity has both an owner and  delivery date 


-  But ,  even as you start executing ,  you are not done engaging in conscious learning 


-  During this phase ,  interim project reports should be simple: The owner of the action should report whether that element is ahead of or behind schedule ,  what has been learned in the latest set of activities ,  and what help he or she may need 


-  For example ,  if the overall target is to reduce the number of poor service interactions by 50% in 60 days ,  then set intermediate goals ,  perhaps weekly ,  based on your intervention plan 


-  ,  Once the project is complete ,  document what you learned in the What Did We Learn and Whats Next section 


-  Here you should both outline the main lessons from the project and articulate the new opportunities that your project revealed 


-  If you exceeded your predictions ,  what does that tell you about future possibilities? In contrast ,  falling short of your target may reveal parts of the work system that you dont understand as well as you thought 


-  Finally ,  and perhaps most importantly ,  what problem are you going to tackle next?  well-functioning process ,  whether in manufacturing ,  customer service ,  or new product development ,  is the product of numerous small changes ,  and fixing one real problem often reveals many additional pressing issues 


-  ,  How does this process work in practice? To illustrate ,  we describe  recent case where one of the authors ,   hospital executive who had been introduced to the basics of problem formulation and structured problem-solving ,  used the techniques to improve organizational performance 


-  The human body often responds to the transplanted organs in dangerous ways 


-  But at the outset of the project ,  the team was able to see an average of seven patients per clinic session 


-  Running the clinic at less than 30% of its ideal capacity potentially compromised care  patients might have to wait longer to be evaluated  and had significant revenue implications for the hospital 


-  With  few iterations ,  Todds challenge led to the following problem statement and supporting background: ,  After adding some additional background information about the problem to the A3 form ,  Todd went on to understand the work 


-   little digging into the root causes revealed numerous ambiguities and departures from the way the system was supposed to work 


-  Patient arrival times were highly variable ,  due both to  lack of clarity on appointment details and to traffic patterns around the hospital; lab testing times varied depending on the time of day; different versions of the pulmonary function test  ( PFT )  were conducted; there was often little coordination between the doctors and the nurse practitioners; and large amounts of time were spent checking each patients medication list 


-  ,  Todd made two key decisions in analyzing the root causes and proposing changes 


-  )  ,  and were more able to make changes 


-  Second ,  Todd included every member of the team ,  from the administrative staff to the physicians ,  in analyzing the root causes and proposing changes 


-  Widespread inclusion allowed every individual to think about specific ways to address the problem in his or her own assigned area 


-  ,  The root-cause analysis led to several proposed changes 


-  The administrative assistant would call patients both  week and  day in advance to remind them about their appointments and provide advice on managing traffic and parking 


-  With these changes ,  Todd set  target of adding two patients per clinic session until the clinic reached  throughput of 18 patients 


-  Todd further outlined  clear set of guidelines ,  the most important being that quality of patient care could in no way be sacrificed during the project 


-  After the initial project was completed ,  the lung transplant clinic subsequently did reach  maximum flow of 18 patients per session 


-  ,  The increased throughput had several positive benefits 


-  Finally ,  Todds team got to control their work and improve it ,  generating clear gains in motivation and engagement 


-  ,  We always ask executives in our MIT Sloan classes: How many of your companies reorganize every 18 to 24 months? Typically ,  more than half of the people in the class raise their hands 


-  Change has become  big business ,  and any number of consultants will be more than happy to assist your company in your next reorganization 


-  Changing everything at once takes  lot of time and resources ,  and big initiatives often collapse under their own weight as senior executives ,  tired of waiting for the results ,  move on to the next big idea 


-  By focusing your scarce resources on those issues that really matter and enabling rapid learning cycles ,  good problem formulation and structured problem-solving offer  sustainable alternative to the endless stream of painful reorganizations and overblown change initiatives that rarely deliver on their promises
