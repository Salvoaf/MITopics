-  If something does go wrong ,  the hope is that having  comprehensive program will help convince regulators that the companys compliance and ethics initiatives were effective  ( the standard set by  


-  More than 15 years after the Enron scandal ,  most companies know very little about how employees make ethical decisions or the psychological mechanisms that cause them to perform unethical and illegal acts 


-  That is why companies need to be aware of how and why employees act the way they do 


-  This starts with understanding how people make decisions generally and how that translates into ethical decision-making 


-  Instead ,  as the work of psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky revealed ,  most decisions are influenced by dual cognitive processes: intuitive and reasoning 


-   lot happens at once through System   the mind offers associations rapidly ,  one idea after another ,  all linked effortlessly 


-  The speed and ease by which System  operates means that most of the work of associative thinking is silent ,  hidden from our conscious selves 


-  ,  The reasoning process  ( referred to as System  )  is more serial and deliberate 


-  System  thinking gives us the experience of agency ,  autonomy ,  and volition 


-  Not surprisingly ,  the reasoning process requires much more mental effort than using intuition 


-  Reasoning isnt necessarily better than intuitive thinking  you wouldnt want to reason your way through every one of your day-to-day tasks  but for the most important decisions ,  its critical 


-  Yet ,  because System  thinking takes more effort ,  our minds have developed to rely primarily on System  ,  reserving System  either for the most challenging mental tasks or to correct errors in our automatic thinking 


-  Instead of correcting errors ,  sometimes our reasoning process reinforces our often flawed intuitions 


-  ,  Although Kahneman and Tversky did not study ethical decision-making directly ,  their findings are critical to understanding how people make decisions in an ethical context 


-  Behavioral ethics researchers have taken the insights of dual system thinking and applied them to ethical decision-making in business 


-  Indeed ,  research has found that self-interest is associated with intuitive thinking 


- 11 ,  If System  is an ethical monitor ,  why does it seem to fail so often? For example ,  what enabled VW employees to install the code used to defeat emissions tests? Although behavioral ethics research helps us understand how the brain works ,  it doesnt explain what allows the brain to take that critical step toward unethical behavior 


- 12 First ,  an individual must possess  problem he or she feels cannot be solved by revealing it to others 


-   non-shareable problem might be anything from gambling debts to the prospect of job loss  anything that the person is deeply concerned about 


-  As corporate leaders know ,  trust is an essential element in any organization  almost every principal-agent relationship is built upon it 


-  Criminologists dont view verbalizations as simple ,  after-the-fact excuses that offenders use to relieve their culpability upon being caught 


-  As the criminologist who developed rationalization theory puts it ,  [t]he rationalization is [the offenders] motivation 


-  ,  This is consistent with what we know about how people make unethical decisions 


-  Behavioral ethics research does not suggest that everyone wants to act ethically but fails to do so because of cognitive obstacles 


- 18 One of the mechanisms is to rationalize our behavior  to reframe how we look at it in order to align our self-perception as  good person with the unethical or illegal behavior we are contemplating 


-  ,   believe that rationalization theory ,  which has greatly influenced the study of both white-collar crime and business ethics ,  explains what happens when an individuals ethical monitor is overcome 


- 19 Essentially ,  rationalizations trick the System  reflective thinking process that normally intervenes to contain our unethicality 


-  Once this happens ,  there is nothing to stop  person from committing an unethical or illegal act ,  regardless of the organizational norms ,  business regulations ,  or criminal laws in place 


-  )  As part of an effective compliance program ,  corporate leaders need to understand these rationalizations and be able to identify their usage 


-  ,  Offenders use this rationalization to relieve themselves of responsibility ,  thereby mitigating social disapproval and  personal sense of failure 


-  This may be considered the catchall rationalization leading to wrongful conduct 


-  ,  Denying the victim takes two forms: when the offender argues that the victims actions were inappropriate and therefore the victim deserved the harm; or when the victim is unknown or not clearly defined 


-  It can take various forms: The offender calls his or her critics hypocrites ,  argues that they are compelled by personal spite ,  asserts they are motivated by political gain ,  or complains about selective enforcement 


-  The actions are needed ,  the offender argues ,  to protect  boss or employee ,  shore up  failing business ,  or maximize shareholder value 


-  For example ,  if an employee argues that he or she committed  fraud not for personal gain but to help the company ,  he is or she is likely using this rationalization 


-  ,  This rationalization is based on  behavioral balance sheet whereby people balance their negative actions against their positive accomplishments ,  thus minimizing their sense of moral guilt 


- 21 It devised  program in which the companys compliance professionals periodically conducted random audits in which they searched through papers ,  emails ,  and other electronic records of managers ,  seizing anything that might be sought as part of  government investigation 


-  Intels general counsel explained that these role-playing exercises served as  wake-up call ,  giving lax executives the experience of being in the governments crosshairs 


-  The companys fake-account scandal demonstrates how executives can affect the context in which employees make decisions regarding ethics 


- 24 The reality was that people had to meet their [sales] goals ,  one former employee explained 


-  They needed  paycheck 


-  So what are companies to do? Is there  way to do compliance better  one that solves some of the problems created by the automaticity of self-interest we all possess? Yes ,  but it requires  fundamental shift in corporate thinking 


-  They consider the behavioral implications of the compliance program at every turn ,  particularly how company policies might foster or defeat employee rationalizations 


-  Although dual-system thinking ,  rationalization ,  and behavioral ethics theories have been around for decades ,  their application to business and compliance is still in its infancy 


-  Hiring  behavioral specialist or developing someone internally to stay abreast of the various fields and their increasing insights into ethical decision-making is  good first step 


- 26 Books on decision-making and dishonesty by serious researchers ,  yet aimed at more general readers ,  can be  helpful resource 


- 27  companys behavioral specialist should create  behavioral compliance curriculum tailored to various groups of employees ,  giving all members of the organization insight into their ethical decision-making processes 


-  But instead of simply asking for the number of miles ,  researchers included  certification of honesty at the top of the form 


- 30 ,   similar approach can be used by companies for any expense report ,  conflict of interest form ,  or funds authorization  anything in which an employee is being asked to engage in behavior that creates compliance risk 


-  Its up to companies to decide how high-tech they want to get 


-  Such predictive monitoring ,  like  certification at the top of  paper form ,  could be used by companies to intervene with  prompt before  problematic behavior occurs ,  forcing the employees System  reasoning system to engage  and thus improving compliance 


-  ,  Companies should also encourage employees to openly discuss rationalizations and how they affect ethical decision-making 


-  Only after patterns of self-exculpatory rationalization are openly discussed and labeled as problematic will employees be able to internalize that knowledge and use it when presented with an opportunity to act unethically 


- 33 The reason is related to the claim of relative normality rationalization ,  which allows individuals to favorably compare their potential unethical act to the unethical acts of others 


-  Behavioral ethics research has shown that even seemingly inconsequential factors can greatly influence ethical decision-making 


-  This is especially true when considering how rationalizations can be drawn from  companys internal culture ,   large part of which depends on incentive structures 


- 36 As  result ,  executives need to be aware of the common forms of rationalization described earlier in this article  and examine where in their organizations conflicting incentives could foster rationalization and wrongdoing 


-  According to research ,  praise and expressions of gratitude motivate more than money ,  and social group interactions motivate individual behavior more than almost anything 


- 37 That means the most effective compliance likely comes from something other than salary and bonus 


-  But behaviorally cognizant programs ,  ones that seek to understand employee decision-making and target the cognitive mechanisms that foster unethicality ,  hold the promise of achieving the primary goals of compliance: reducing unethical and illegal behavior within the company
