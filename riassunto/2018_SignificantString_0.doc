-  We are not specifically arguing in favor of traditional ratings ,  nor do we believe most legacy performance and feedback systems are built to address todays talent management challenges 


-  The answer to complexity is not oversimplification; the right process is the one that leverages the known facts about what drives performance 


-  Today ,  HR too often ignores these facts ,  instead chasing bright ,  shiny objects ,  what John Boudreau and Steven Rice have referred to as flavor-of-the-day HR novelties 


-  But that is hardly  reason for managers not to provide it 


-  An employees satisfaction with feedback has  powerful mediating impact on performance; if he or she is dissatisfied with feedback ,  other performance factors ,  such as accountability or confidence in performing the task ,  plummet 


-  If  rating summarizes feedback that is clear ,  fair ,  developmental ,  sensitive to employees needs ,  and more ,  everyone will likely be satisfied 


-  You may not like the conclusion that you need  filling 


-  But you can be satisfied that the diagnosis is thorough ,  and the message can be delivered without making you feel like  jerk for not brushing or flossing adequately 


-  And regardless of how happy you are ,  addressing the problem is the best possible outcome 


-  Studies show that positive feedback may lead to  decrease in effort ,  just as negative feedback may boost ones desire to achieve more 


-  An experimental study of strategic decision-makers showed that resting on the laurels of past successes and consistently getting only positive feedback will impede people from listening to negative feedback in the future ,  when it may actually be needed to correct  faulty course of action 


-  Several factors should be taken into consideration to match the right message with the right person in  concrete situation 


-  For instance ,  motivation improves both when positive feedback is given to people with  promotion focus  ( those who want to achieve and take risk ,  who are sensitive to rewards )  and when negative feedback is given to people with  prevention focus  ( those who want to avoid trouble and are generally cautious ,  who are sensitive to punishment )  


-  Yet  blanket belief that bad feedback is bad aligns with most peoples desire to avoid conflict 


-  It is easier to believe that feedback needs to be motivational and uplifting   clearly mistaken assumption 


-  This goes against the conventional wisdom that employees need  lot of feedback ,  especially as they are learning  new task or  new role 


-  Yet its  helpful reminder that not all our long-held assumptions may be correct  and our mistaken assumptions may come back to haunt us if we hinge business decisions on them 


- 10 Instead of thinking expansively ,  in terms of Yes ,  and   ,  HR responds by removing existing processes 


-  Most HR leaders would accept this as fact 


-  We learned from  study of bank workers that source credibility  trust in the person giving feedback  strongly correlates with perceived accuracy and with  desire to respond ,  both of which have an impact on performance 


- 12 When trust and engagement with managers are low ,  feedback wont drive the desired outcomes 


-  HR must then look for alternative sources of feedback ,  such as  360-degree assessment ,  because feedback from  low-credibility leader wont change anything 


-   careful review of scientific data affirms that simply providing feedback does not necessarily move the needle 


-  For this myth to become truth ,  the manager has to deliver quality feedback that takes into account  variety of factors  ( such as task ,  context ,  and personal characteristics )  and synthesizes them into an appropriate message 


-  Such  message could ,  in fact ,  be  performance rating 


-  When people dont know how they objectively compare with others ,  they are less likely to put in discretionary effort 


-  This magical thinking is refuted in study after study 


-  Even those managers who indicate they know what to say to help employees develop ,  and how to say it ,  need  support process to guide them 


-  Out of 500 managers surveyed globally ,  about  third confessed that they did not know how to help people change ,  and less than 10% said they knew how to make such behavioral change sustainable 


-  Oversimplifying performance management in times when the managers need structure most is hardly responsible 


-  ,  Changes to performance management that respond to just one or two chosen facts ,  while ignoring the complexity of human performance ,  waste an opportunity to drive individual performance and organizational success 


-  We believe HR has  responsibility to understand this complexity and provide clear and concise guidance to managers on how to give feedback and manage performance in ways that drive business results 


-  This requires an appreciation of why feedback matters and what makes feedback good 


-  ,  What do we really know about what happens with feedback in organizations? ,  We know that successful leaders know themselves 


-  We know that feedback is  key component in gaining this self-awareness ,  and self-aware people are more successful 


- 17 We know that feedback can move the needle ,  and that appropriately frequent and repeated feedback spurs personal change to take place 


- 18 Of course ,  other individual and organizational aspects contribute ,  such as  feedback-rich environment and the individuals desire to engage in the conversation ,  and we must embrace this multidimensionality 


-  ,  We think of feedback as an investment of time and resources: Bad investments destroy value ,  good investments add value ,  and the best investments create sustainable value 


-  When giving feedback ,  take time to explain how the business is doing 


-  Show how individual goals relate to bigger enterprise objectives and strategies 


-  Highlight the connections between the individuals work and business needs 


-  And importantly ,  explain why the subject matter of the feedback you are about to give is important to the business 


-  Indeed ,  data from experiments at the University of California ,  Los Angeles ,  suggests that when information is ego-relevant  directly affecting ones opinion of oneself  the feedback is more likely to be misinterpreted 


- 21 ,  How performance objectives are framed ,  though ,  can make  big difference 


-  While the managers main goal is to increase performance ,  the positioning of feedback works best when it contains the expectation of change and when it provokes the recipient to think in terms of  learning goal ,  such as ,  Yes ,   am keen to know how to design responsive web pages 


- 22 ,  Employee satisfaction with feedback creates  virtuous circle 


-  When employees receive feedback that they perceive to be valuable and intended to help them improve ,  other factors of performance are unlocked: utility  ( I believe feedback will help me achieve my goals )  ,  accountability  ( I ought to do my job well )  ,  self-efficacy  ( I am able to perform the task )  ,  and social awareness  ( I take others opinions of my work seriously )  


-  Giving employees feedback on how their behaviors help or hamper their ability to achieve the desired business outcomes will be more effective and position them for success in the future 


- 25 Delivering performance feedback in  manner that helps the employee realize his or her own nonproductive behaviors leads to  better mood at work ,  greater job satisfaction ,  and stronger organizational commitment 


-  The group receiving detailed feedback did better on the task ,  but the group getting generic feedback had to think more and therefore demonstrated  greater degree of competence after the simulation 


-  For specificity ,  point out the exact behaviors that need to be improved ,  using facts and concrete situations from the recent past ,  and relate them to customer or peer feedback ,  if available 


-  ,  Similarly ,  consistency from one feedback interaction to another reinforces the message and reminds the employee to stay on track 


-  They must consider the complexity of the operating environment ,  the adversity of situations ,  and the support that has or has not been provided to help employees attain their goals 


-  We call these factors feedback modifiers 


-  The fact that this adds complexity is why those who lead others are paid  premium 


-  Managerial discretion is part of performance evaluation and ,  we believe ,  usually  positive aspect 


-  We know that managers assessments are typically more accurate than self-assessments 


- 30 Managerial discretion also enables leaders to take account of everything that determines performance ,  including mitigating factors that would rightly impact perceptions of fairness 


-  However ,  this same discretion can have negative consequences  through managers unconscious biases or more malevolent factors ,  such as the politics of the organization 


- 31 ,  These noise factors can make it hard to provide fair ,  consistent ,  and useful feedback 


-  Examples of noise include: ,  When managers have the right understanding of feedback ,  their job becomes much easier 


-  ,  GEs Jack Welch once said ,  As  manager ,  you owe candor to your people , 33 and collectively we need to do  better job at enabling better ,  more candid feedback 


-  ,  We conclude that  lack of honest ,  focused ,  and timely performance feedback is  major constraint to organizational performance 


-  Unfortunately ,  we see too many examples of HR ignoring the difficult facts in favor of simplistic ,  flavor-of-the-month solutions that will only make matters worse 


- 35 It is HRs job to take on the difficult challenge of instilling  robust and comprehensive approach to feedback and performance management that fits the particular needs of the organization
