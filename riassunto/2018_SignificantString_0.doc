- Late last fall ,  after  semester of classes ,   young ,  white ,  male MBA student came to me and said ,  So ,   now realize just how badly women still experience gender discrimination ,  and it makes me really angry 


-  But  have no idea how to stop it or what to do about it 


-  His words communicated  genuine desire to combat attitudes and treatment that for many women are all too familiar 


-  ,   would have been surprised by his comments had  not witnessed  similar reaction months earlier when interviewing seasoned executives who serve on the boards of large ,  publicly traded  


-  ,  In both practice and research ,  we are doing  better job at bringing attention to the problem 


-  But we havent established enough tangible suggestions for how to challenge it 


-  One idea Ive been exploring: Giving people clearer language to use in their day to day encounters with prejudice 


-  ,   have been examining the effect of gender composition on the decision-making processes of corporate boards ,  as part of  research project with my coauthors  Dr 


-  After interviewing  couple dozen female executives ,  it became clear to my coauthors and me that female directors consistently experienced distinct barriers in the boardroom when they were the only woman ,  or one of just  few women ,  on the team 


-  ,  When investigating this issue from the male point of view ,  we found  significant lack of awareness regarding these obstacles 


-  Impediments include women having difficulties with nomination onto boards because they didnt fit the typical mold  white ,  male ,  former CEO  or ,  once on the board ,  being excluded from decisions that happened on the golf course or in mens executive lounges  ( yes ,  bathrooms )  


-  ,  As we recounted these examples to our male interviewees ,  we witnessed disbelief ,  shock ,  and disappointment 


-  We saw real frustration at the realization that their female colleagues were routinely experiencing obstacles that they and their male colleagues were not 


-  ,  And again ,  we heard the sentiment ,  OK ,  this still exists and its worse than  thought it was 


-  What can  do about it?  want to help fix it 


-  ,  Of course ,  the fact that gender discrimination is alive and well should not be surprising ,  especially given the attention that the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements have given to sexual harassment in the last nine months 


-  However ,  in both practice and research ,  we have not moved past awareness of the issue to tangible recommendations on how to tackle it 


-  ,  One exception might be the recommendation that women seek out sponsors 


-  Sponsors go beyond mentors: Whereas mentorship involves providing advice and support ,  sponsorship involves advocating for  mentee and helping to position her for career-advancing opportunities 


-  Research shows that women are much less likely than men to receive active sponsorship ,  which some argue might be an especially fruitful pathway to career advancement 


-  ,  Mentorship and sponsorship ,  however ,  are strategies that take time to develop and enact effectively 


-  What happens when we hear or see discriminatory behavior actually happening? How do we respond in the moment to an off-color comment? Or to  male colleague exhibiting  common unconscious display of dominance by speaking just  little bit longer and louder and drowning out the voice of his female colleague? ,  What are the words that will call attention to the issue ,  without sacrificing work relationships? ,  In my research ,   have begun to investigate developing and testing the efficacy of what  call scripts 


-  There is currently no established set of scripts to address gender discrimination  that is ,   set of words or phrases that would signal to  peer that he has crossed  line ,  whether knowingly or unknowingly 


-   phrase as simple as: Can you repeat what you just said? when  biased remark is uttered or said as  joke can be  straightforward way to make someone aware that theyve said something out of bounds 


-   response like ,  Thats not cool ,  or That comment doesnt reflect the person  know you to be can bring  shot of level-headed interruption to an interaction ,  prompting the speaker to reconsider his perspective 


-  They allow us to plan ,  in more deliberate ways ,  on how to push back respectfully and effectively 


-  To be clear ,  lack of awareness is not an inherently male problem 


-  If women made up the majority in powerful ,  high-social-status positions and men comprised the minority in such positions ,  women would be likely to similarly fall into majority-favoring behavior that could become mostly automatic and unconscious 


-  Its how the human brain works  we prioritize what we are exposed to personally ,  and we have difficulty understanding the perspective of those who have different experiences than us 


-  ,  Another cognitive shortcoming that scripts could help address is the use of confirmation bias 


-  Humans make decisions about people based on previous experiences and beliefs ,  and because people are generally exposed to more male leaders than female leaders ,  males are generally associated more with leadership positions than are women 


-  But if men were to adopt scripts to disrupt this self-reinforcing cycle ,  more equal weight could be given to womens voices in decision-making processes ,  leading to greater visibility ,  endorsement ,  and ultimately ,  promotion 


-  Indeed ,  given the threat of backlash effects that women experience when speaking up in response to this situation ,  the role of male colleagues  especially at the peer level  in expressing this script is particularly powerful 


-  ,  In the workplace ,  in schools ,  and in society in general ,  biased comments and everyday power plays may seem small individually ,  but they are cumulatively significant 


-  ,  Men ,  by virtue of their majority position ,  have  unique opportunity to directly combat gender discrimination 


-  Women can also contribute by responding with ideas and feedback in support of their male colleagues attempts to right the process 


-  Learning how to develop and enact scripts to disengage from the automaticity of our everyday interactions is ultimately  collaborative effort
