- Should birds of  feather flock together? Not if the goal is to promote innovation ,  says Rachelle  


-  Sampson ,  assistant professor of logistics ,  business and public policy at the University of Marylands Robert  


-  After studying hundreds of research and development  ( R&D )  alliances ,  Sampson reports in her 2004 working paper R&D Alliances and Firm Performance: The Impact of Technological Diversity and Alliance Organization on Innovation that alliances work best when there are moderate differences in technological capabilities between the partners 


-  Whats more ,  she finds ,  the organizational form of an alliance can have  significant effect on the amount of innovation it yields 


-  ,  Alliances have become increasingly popular as companies look for  higher return on their R&D investments 


-  They often offer  nimbler alternative to that of in-house development ,  while allowing companies to share risks and costs 


-  But many alliances fall short of their founders expectations 


-  Knowledge transfer is  tricky business ,  particularly when knowledge is complex or tacit 


-  Moreover ,  mutual distrust often hinders learning within alliances 


-  Todays partner ,  after all ,  may turn out to be tomorrows competitor 


-  ,  In order for alliances to succeed ,  Sampson observes ,  the partners must be both able and willing to share knowledge-based capabilities 


-  First ,  the level of technological diversity shapes an alliances potential payoff  if the partners are too different ,  theyll have little to say to one another; if theyre too similar ,  theyll have little to learn 


-  Second ,  an alliances organizational form helps determine the likelihood that its potential will be achieved 


-  Drawing on two complementary theoretical perspectives  transaction-cost economics and the knowledge-based view  Sampson argues that knowledge transfer is easier within more hierarchical organizational forms ,  such as equity joint ventures ,  which benefit from clear lines of authority and common routines 


-  In addition ,  cooperation may be more likely in these types of alliance 


-  Managers sometimes hesitate to invest in an alliance out of concern that it might be captured by the other side 


-  Giving alliances greater organizational independence and more formal governance can help allay these fears 


-  ,  These advantages are likely to be especially important when technological diversity is high 


-  When knowledge sharing is relatively straightforward ,  equity joint ventures may not have  significant advantage over looser organizational forms ,  such as alliances that are based on bilateral contracts 


-  But once the barriers to cooperation start to rise ,  mechanisms that facilitate and encourage knowledge transfer can really pay off 


-  ,  To test these hypotheses ,  Sampson collected data on all 463 R&D alliances formed by firms in the telecommunications equipment industry between 1991 and the end of 1993 


-  She identified the level of technological diversity in each alliance by calculating the degree to which the partners patent portfolios overlapped 


-  She also constructed  measure of postalliance innovative performance for each firm by counting the patents the company applied for in the four years following an alliances formation and weighting each patent by the number of citations it received in later patent applications 


-  ,  Within this sample ,  Sampson found that firm patenting initially increased with the level of technological diversity in an alliance but then decreased 


-  For the median firm ,  participating in an alliance with moderate diversity contributed nearly 14 times more to postalliance patenting than participating in an alliance with low diversity 


-  Similarly ,  moderate-diversity alliances outperformed high-diversity alliances by  factor of  


-  ( This analysis controlled for  variety of factors ,  including pre-alliance patenting ,  alliance scope ,  experience with alliances and prior linkages between the partners 


-  )  ,  Splitting the sample by organizational form produced similar results 


-  Of the 463 alliances Sampson studied ,  398 were based on bilateral contracts ,  and 65 were organized as equity joint ventures 


-  In both subsamples ,  postalliance patenting initially rose and then fell with technological diversity 


-  However ,  equity joint ventures had  significant advantage over bilateral contracts once an alliances diversity exceeded  


-  )  At  moderate level of diversity ,  equity joint ventures delivered 35 times more innovation than contract-based alliances 


-  When diversity was high ,  the median firm was found to have benefited over 100 times more from  joint venture 


-  ,  Sampson is wary of basing out-of-sample predictions on these findings  in other words ,  your mileage may vary  or even of endorsing equity joint ventures outright 


-  After all ,  all forms of organization have disadvantages  ( including higher setup costs and more bureaucracy in this particular case )  


-  Instead ,  she says ,  managers should draw two broad conclusions from her research 


-  First ,  there is an optimal level of technological diversity within an alliance 


-  And second ,  organization matters 


-  Its not something you throw to the in-house counsel after youve closed the deal 


-  Its  critical strategic variable that can help determine how much bang an alliance delivers for each R&D buck 


-  What is also required is the acknowledgment that governance has to continually adapt to changing conditions because  company ,  its management and business environment are forever evolving 


-  Specifically ,  the markets would weed out and penalize  through declining share prices and takeovers  executives who tried to manipulate their companies in any way that was adverse to long-term value creation 


-  Everything affecting value creation  ( including environmental costs such as pollution )  would be priced by the markets and rewarded or punished in line with the contribution to or subtraction from value creation that those factors engendered 


-  ,  Indeed ,  if the market could capture everything and no one could manipulate decision making with monopoly power ,  companies that maximized their economic value  ( the difference between projected revenues and the market cost of all the resources used )  would also maximize the public good 


-  Thus ,  governance is necessary to deal with the things that fall outside markets as well as the people who would manipulate decisions in their own interests 


-  ,  Two broad streams of commentary and research deal with these issues and the need for different governance roles 


-  Sociologists have explored the role and impact of companies on society ,  especially the relationships between organizations and other stakeholder groups 


-  Markets alone do not capture the full impact of companies; in particular ,  they do not price certain inputs and outputs of the business ,  so-called externalities ,  such as the effect of an organizations activities on society at large 


-  Thus ,  regulations and governance are needed to deal with the consequences of those externalities ,  especially those promoted by stakeholder groups 


-  But the right role of the board depends on the importance of the externalities ,  which can vary from country to country and from market to market over the life of the company 


-  ,  Economists have explored how shareholders can get managers to run  company as agents acting in the owners interests ,  given the appropriate regulations and incentives 


-  Inside an organization ,  top managers pursue power and wealth; outside the company ,  directors ,  shareholders ,  regulators ,  unions ,  nongovernmental organizations  ( NGOs )  and governments want influence 


-  Each side inevitably tries to distort the governance system to its advantage ,  but managers have the advantage of their monopoly on power and access to inside information 


-  Thus the right role of the board depends on the importance of the agency problems ,  the difficulty of getting managers to act in the owners interests ,  which can vary over the life of the company ,  and the tenure of each CEO 


-  ,  To deal with externalities and agency problems ,  boards have an ongoing portfolio of activities ,  including auditing ,  oversight mechanisms ,  company policies ,  compensation incentives ,  succession planning and so on 


-  But boards are influenced by economic ,  sociocultural ,  psychological and political forces ,  which each have their own separate ,  independent dynamics 


-  At any period in time ,  to avoid confusion and to pursue  direction in dealing with the current conditions facing the organization ,  boards must emphasize  particular subset of activities in decision making and resource allocation 


-  ,  The driving governance role must change with shifts in the importance and nature of the externalities that shape the agendas of shareholders and stakeholders ,  as well as with shifts in the agency problems created by dysfunctional managerial power 


-  See Sidebar ,  Because information can never be fully transparent ,  boards always have the fundamental fiduciary responsibility of auditing the financial performance of companies to ensure that they are being run in the interests of their owners 


-  ,  However ,  when markets are not efficient and well regulated ,  boards have to deal with the factors that fall outside the markets and regulations 


-  If the externalities are excluded and ignored ,  they may come back to undermine the long-run economic performance of the company 


-  ,  The boards of companies active in emerging economies have to take an even broader view of their oversight and policy responsibility because value creation in emerging markets requires  wider range of company activities than in the developed world 


-  ,  The board has to develop oversight and policy standards to ensure that management puts in place local rules of corporate governance both to address the inadequacies in the external environment and to avoid compromising the long-term future of the company 


-  Oversight of societal impact and ethical standards are essential ,  for example ,  to prevent the type of externalities that have confronted Nike Inc 


-  ,  Markets in transition ,  such as recently deregulated markets or those created by new technology ,  also require  broader governance perspective than that dictated by short-term market forces 


- s collapse was due to woefully inadequate governance oversight and policies for dealing with the long-term risk in the new derivative markets that the company created 


-  While Enron was inappropriately pricing the long-term risks it was taking on ,  some of its customers in the deregulated electricity market in the United States skimped on investing in new capacity and faced an embarrassing series of power outages 


-  In these cases ,  governance oversight and policies were too narrowly focused on short-term financial auditing and ignored the longer-term impact of inadequate risk management and investment 


-  ,  Influential NGOs often emerge in response to externalities with negative societal impacts that are either unpriced by the market or are perceived to be inadequately regulated 


-  The activism of NGOs signals that companies need to broaden their governance perspective and develop policies for engaging with the NGOs 


-  And Shell completely discounted the impact of the NGOs that protested the proposed disposal of the Brent Spar oil rig in the North Sea 


-  ,  When managerial power is effective ,  in the sense that it promotes the creation of long-term economic value and does not manipulate the way that value gets shared ,  the board can restrict its activity to monitoring the value-creating performance of the company and developing policy to govern the distribution of value to shareholders and other stakeholders 


-  ,  However ,  when managerial power is dysfunctional ,  in the sense that it either does not promote value creation or it manipulates the distribution of value to its advantage ,  the board has to become more involved 


-  The most common examples include contexts in which performance is poor ,  either financially or in dealing with externalities; the CEO makes major strategic moves unilaterally  ( that is ,  without consulting the board )  ethical or transparency standards are breached; or the CEO asks for excessive compensation that is not linked to performance 


-  ,  Dealing with poor performance or major unilateral moves is  special challenge when it involves long-serving CEOs whose early performance had been good 


-  The passive role of GMs board during the decades after World War II is  classic example of the difficulty of reversing course ,  even when major externalities and poor performance become evident 


-  ,  When GM finally woke up to the challenge of new competition in the 1980s ,  the board did nothing to prevent managements drive to spend $90 billion on new high technology and acquisitions that could not be digested organizationally 


-  He withheld key financial data and budget allocation proposals until the day before the meetings and sometimes distributed them minutes before the participants convened 


-  Past research has found that CEOs with weak boards of directors tend to receive greater compensation than CEOs with powerful boards 


-  The increasing concern among shareholders over the distribution of value is putting pressure on boards to get involved sooner to constrain the violation of ethical standards and the manipulation of value distribution 


-  )  The roles reflect two main differences in board culture 


-  First ,  boards can be concerned mainly with shareholder interests ,  or they can also take into account the interests of other stakeholders to deal with important externalities 


-  Second ,  boards can restrict their activities to monitoring ,  or they can be involved in the conduct of the organization at the top to deal with ineffective management 


-  ,  When management is effective and externalities are insignificant ,  boards should assume an auditing role 


-  The dominant activity here is the fundamental fiduciary responsibility of monitoring company performance in the interests of the shareholders 


-  Competitive markets and efficient regulations are sufficient to handle all significant externalities ,  and top management is effective in creating and distributing value 


-  Also ,  the perspective is focused and short term 


-  ,  An auditing role is appropriate in stable business environments that do not require large investments or big moves with high external impact 


-  Such conditions are common ,  for example ,  when small and midsize businesses have effective CEOs ,  are not growing rapidly and are not big enough to generate nonmarket effects that may eventually undermine long-run economic performance 


-  ,  When externalities are important ,  the board can still limit itself to  monitoring role if management is effective 


-  But the perspective of the board has to go well beyond its fiduciary responsibility to incorporate oversight and policy for the strategic ,  societal and risk effects of those externalities 


-  Although the financial audit committee still must play an important role ,  other board committees have to take the lead in supervising managements response to issues of social responsibility ,  long-term strategy and risk management 


-  Thus ,  the mix of board members has to shift to include experts who can deal with such concerns 


-  And most importantly ,  the decision-making criteria have to include multiple objectives ,  especially the ability to make trade-offs between short-term financial performance and longer-term value creation ,  and those trade-offs should continually incorporate feedback from the externalities 


-  All of this amounts to  basic shift in the culture of the board to what can be called  supervising role 


-  ,   supervising role is appropriate when  large ,  powerful company with effective management makes strategic moves that create value over the long run but have significant risks or have an impact on society outside the companys markets 


-  The supervising role is especially important when  company is considering big moves; it is essential for high-risk businesses with strong ,  effective CEOs who are involved in deal making and large investments 


-  ,  When the CEO and other top executives are ineffective in creating value or when they manipulate value distribution to their advantage ,  the board has to move from  monitoring role to more active involvement 


-  When the externalities are insignificant ,  the board can restrict its perspective to  focused short-term view ,  dealing with the CEO and the top team 


-  ,  To do so ,  the board has to change the power balance and establish its independence from the CEO with the independent leadership of outside directors or by splitting the roles of CEO and chairman of the board 


-  In fact ,  coaching is often the primary function of boards that appoint  new CEO from outside the company 


-  ,  When management is ineffective and the business is affected by  number of nonmarket factors ,  the board has to go beyond either coaching or supervising and become actively involved in execution with  broad ,  long-term perspective 


-  It calls for the ability to interact ,  negotiate and possibly lead combined working groups with outside stakeholders 


-  Ultimately ,  the board might also have to ensure the implementation of the companys agreements with those stakeholders 


-  The task requires deft people skills and  keen sense of the politics of public groups and coalitions 


-  ,  The right driving role does not remain static but evolves with changes in the externalities in the market and the agency problems created by ineffective management 


-  ,  Three types of patterns are commonly associated with the emergence of new externalities: economic and political cycles ,  industry and business-model shifts and organizational crises 


-  For  good example of those factors at play ,  consider the story of the collapse of Swissair 


-  The Swissair board included many of the most respected CEOs of large Swiss multinationals ,  as well as personalities from the public sector 


-  In the late 1980s and 1990s ,  none of the board members had  background in the airline industry 


-  As one who later became chairman put it ,  I am not  friend of the notion that at the board level one should in  way duplicate the management requirements 


-  Management has the know-how to lead the airline 


-  ,  In 1987 ,  the European Commission introduced  three-phase deregulation of the airline industry in Europe ,  which led to the emergence of low-cost competitors like Ryanair ,  easyJet Airline and Virgin Express 


-  Not surprisingly ,  given its history and composition ,  the Swissair board made no move away from its dominant monitoring role toward more of  supervisory one ,  and instead of responding directly to the shift in industry conditions ,  it pursued its global ambitions by joining Delta Air Lines and Singapore Airlines Ltd 


-  ,  In December 1992 ,  the Swiss population voted against joining the European Common Market ,  and Swissair feared being locked out of that market 


-  Within  few months ,  the company announced plans to set up  jointly owned entity ,  to be known as Alcazar ,  with Scandinavian Airlines System  ( SAS )  ,  KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Austrian Airlines 


-  But the agreement failed at the end of 1993 ,  with concerns among the Swiss public and parliament about massive layoffs and the loss of Swissairs identity 


-  Rather than play an active steering role in dealing with those stakeholder concerns ,  though ,  the Swissair board was still trapped in its traditional monitoring role 


-  ,  Swissairs management proposed  radical shift in business model toward becoming  network manager 


-  In that capacity ,  the airline would perform the brain function of an alliance ,  integrating network and product design ,  scheduling ,  yield ,  pricing ,  brand management and sales ,  while purchasing both flying and nonflying services from other providers 


- 10 This strategy involved taking equity stakes in national or regional carriers ,  so Swissair borrowed to take  49 


- 5% stake in Sabena ,  the ailing Belgian national airline 


-  In the absence of coaching from the board but working with McKinsey ,  Bruggisser proceeded with the network-manager strategy ,  reorganizing the company into  holding structure ,  called the SAir Group ,  with four divisions: SAirLines ,  SAirLogistics ,  SAirServices and SAirRelations 


-  He produced  good profit performance in 1997 ,  which the media touted ,  and he deftly managed the company throughout the tragic Swissair crash off the coast of Halifax in 1998 


-  To accelerate implementation of the network-manager objective ,  Bruggisser carried out McKinseys recommendation of  hunter strategy ,  taking minority investments of up to 30% in  German tour operator ,  LTU; three small French airlines ,  AOM ,  Air Libert and Air Littoral; LOT Polish Airlines; and the South African national airline ,  SAA 


- 11 Except for LOT ,  the airlines involved were in poor financial shape 


-  On the advice of management ,  the board approved these investments for  total of  


-  ,  But differences at the top between Bruggisser ,  who was CEO of SAir Group  ( the holding company )  ,  and Jeffrey Katz ,  then CEO of Swissair ,  over the personal ambitions of Katz ,  who had come from American Airlines ,  led to the collapse of  potential partnership with American 


-  With the board far from playing the necessary coaching role ,  Bruggisser then proceeded on his own to explore  full merger with Alitalia Airlines ,  which required additional investment 


-  ,  However ,  when McKinsey produced  report in August 2000 showing that an additional  


- 45 billion francs would be needed ,   new member of the board ,  Mario Corti ,  the CFO of Nestl ,  started asking detailed questions that exposed the fragility of the companys financial position 


-  The hunter strategy was scuttled; Bruggissers 22-year career came to an end; and the chairman of the board ,  Eric Honegger ,  became the interim CEO 


-  ,  But the story doesnt end there 


-  billion francs  ( due to  write-off of investments in other airlines and provisions for financial obligations assumed with those deals )  as well as an increase in debt from 13 billion to 19 billion francs  ( due to the recognition of previously off-balance-sheet financing )  


-  The directors received the financial figures every month and met every other month to evaluate the performance of the SAir Group 


-  Working closely with management ,  the board introduced initiatives to sell noncore businesses ,  such as the hotels and stakes in the other airlines 


-  21 ,  2001 ,  Moodys downgraded the companys debt to junk status 


-  When suppliers demanded immediate reimbursements ,  the company couldnt pay for jet fuel 


-  ,   striking thing about the Swissair story is the way in which the board never came close to  supervisory role despite the increasing risk of the hunter strategy 


-  The board remained passive even when problems became manifest on the front pages of the press ,  as the partner airline unions balked at the network strategy 


-  McKinsey had much to lose in client fees if it were to recommend that Swissairs management drop the increasingly risky network-manager and hunter strategies 


-  ,  Swissairs story might provide  stunning example of  boards failure ,  but the governance issues the airline faced are hardly unique 


-  Several measures can help boards to preempt similar kinds of problems 


-  To pick up changes in externalities ,  it has to delegate that responsibility to individual members or subcommittees ,  as the need requires ,  so that they can monitor the societal impact of the companys activities as well as determine the longer-term strategic and risk effects 


-  The board also has to set aside some time on its agenda to discuss those topics ,  and it should request periodic reports both from the designated members  ( to determine how political ,  economic and industry events are affecting externalities )  as well as from management  ( to assess the impact of industry ,  business-model and organizational changes )  


-  They can do so only by meeting periodically without the CEO and those directors who have ties to the company 


-  Their report back to the full board should include an evaluation of the performance of the CEO and the top-management team in terms of value creation ,  ethics and transparency ,  as well as an assessment of how the boards policies are affecting the long-term health of the company 


-  The purpose is to determine the appropriate balance in the distribution of power between top management and the independent external directors and to ascertain that the right governance roles are driving board deliberations and supporting the value-creating model of the company in sync with the business environment 


-  ,  The most difficult task  and therefore the one most likely to benefit from the help of outsiders  is the assessment of the dominant governance role ,  in terms of the culture of decision making ,  resource allocation and board action 


-  Is that culture one of financial monitoring  ( auditing role )  ,  or multiple objectives and policy trade-offs between the short and long run  ( supervising role )  ,  or involvement with the CEOs development  ( coaching role )  ,  or active board initiatives to offset weaknesses in the top-management team ,  especially in managing externalities  ( steering role )  ,  The key to preempting governance problems is the ability of the board to shift its dominant role early enough to deal with emerging issues 


-  In addition to anticipation ,  this calls for role flexibility ,  which can be enhanced in several ways 


-  have recently moved toward having  majority of outsiders with diverse backgrounds on their boards 


-  ,  have organized for independent leadership of their outside directors 


-  ,  Third ,  boards that have the resources should develop  range of activities tied to different board members or subcommittees: oversight of strategic ,  societal and risk effects; policies for ethics ,  transparency and compensation; processes for succession planning; coaching and so on 


-  ,  Finally ,  because human beings are generally not adept at self-evaluation and monitoring ,   recommended practice is for boards to file an annual report to describe how they are dealing with externalities and agency problems 


-  This document might be submitted to the annual general meeting of shareholders as well as to  public agency ,  such as the Securities and Exchange Commission 


-  At the very least ,  this practice will encourage boards to take  more active role in monitoring and governing themselves as well as the organizations they oversee 


- Business executives love to hate information technology ,  yet IT expenditures continue to increase 


-  At the same time ,  accounts of wasted investments make headlines ,  providing fuel for IT skeptics: An estimated 68% of corporate IT projects are neither on time nor on budget ,  and they dont deliver the originally stated business goals 


-  ,  Considering that IT budgets comprise hundreds or even thousands of projects running simultaneously across functions ,  business units and geographies ,  its  challenge to select projects for investment that are synchronized with corporate strategy 


-  Charged with managing such projects effectively ,  executives are asking ,  How do we maximize the business value from IT investments?2 ,  The answer may be IT portfolio management  ( ITPM )  that is ,  managing IT as  portfolio of assets similar to  financial portfolio and striving to improve the performance of the portfolio by balancing risk and return 


-  ,  Analogies that build on financial-portfolio theory or on concepts about product and research-and-development pipeline portfolios  ( which are more akin to IT portfolio management than to financial portfolios )  are not new 


-  ITPM has evolved into  combination of practices and techniques used to measure and increase the return on individual and aggregate technology investments  existing and planned  and to reduce risk 


-  An investment portfolio comprises all direct and indirect IT projects and assets ,  including infrastructure ,  outsourcing contracts and software licenses 


-  companies ,  we conducted research from November 2002 to March 2003 


-  The research  consisting of  survey of 130 Fortune 1000 chief information officers and in-depth interviews with selected respondents  measured ITPM adoption ,  identified implementation hurdles ,  assessed benefits ,  defined best practices and formulated strategies for success 


-  )  ,  Eighty-nine percent of the CIOs polled were very aware of ITPM ,  and 65% believed that the approach yields significant business value 


-  Nevertheless ,  only  few organizations  ( 17% )  appeared to be realizing ITPMs full value 


-  ,  Why dont executives adopt the practices they purportedly believe in? Why ,  for example ,  do 59% of companies regularly calculate the return on investment of IT projects before making an investment decision ,  but only 25% measure the realized ROI after  projects completion? Skills ,  attitudes and behaviors must change 


-  ,  Consider the success of Harrahs Entertainment Inc 


-  ,  the worlds largest gaming company 


-  When he was chief operating officer ,  Gary Loveman  now president and CEO  began collecting extensive data on small-scale gamblers in order to measure the success of promotions targeted to them 


-  Soon the rest of the casino industry found itself playing catch-up 


-  The model segments  companys IT portfolio management into four stages: ad hoc ,  defined ,  managed and synchronized 


-  ,  Companies at this stage make decisions about investments in an uncoordinated way 


-  For example ,  an IT audit of  major Fortune 500 investment bank found four customer-relationship-management  ( CRM )  projects under way in three divisions using software from different vendors 


-  Similarly ,   global property-and-casualty insurer found itself on the cusp of spending $10 million to implement software that was already in use 


-  When David Faith ,  senior vice president of the Enterprise Group at Scoular Co 


-  ,  which provides agricultural-industry services such as grain-elevator management ,  viewed IT spending from  portfolio perspective ,  he noticed the companys myriad fixed-line ,  wireless and videoconferencing contracts 


-  To tackle misperceptions about large-company IT ,  he engaged senior executives in  strategic dialogue about telecommunications needs ,  consolidated vendors and cut spending by 50% while simultaneously expanding network services 


-  ,  Today Scoulars process is at the synchronized level 


-  ,  Our research also uncovered another instance of the benefits of an ITPM approach: One particular global investment management firm used findings from  portfolio exercise to cut telecommunication costs by $30 million 


-  After being codified ,  project data are logged in  central database 


-  Having developed methods for evaluating and prioritizing investment proposals ,  the corporate IT department also has instituted central budget oversight and ,  most likely ,  maintains  central project-management office 


-  Pertinent IT personnel have  basic understanding of the financial metrics used to make investment decisions  the portfolio having been defined in terms of an initial set of agreed-upon facts 


-  Features missing at this level are consistency in organizationwide compliance ,  links into budgeting cycles and feedback loops to assess actual returns 


-  ,  Companies functioning at the defined stage often struggle to link the IT portfolio to business strategy because of  lack of common beliefs and standards 


-  As the CIO of  leading professional-services firm explained ,  My biggest challenge was at the lower levels ,  both from IT people as well as the business users 


-  IT people will do only whatever the users ask them to do ,  and then theyll complain about it 


-  ,  The CIO added ,  Last year we created  new spreadsheet for project proposals that looked at risk as well as reward 


-  Well ,  we found that our project managers look at risk and reward very differently 


-  ,  Companies functioning at the managed stage distinguish themselves from those at the defined stage by  standardized ITPM process that enables objective project selection and has  clear link with business strategy 


-  convenience-store chain and  large paper-products manufacturer 


-  Financial metrics ,  such as ROI and net present value  ( NPV )  ,  are consistently calculated and used in reviews with business leaders to align IT spending with strategy 


-  ,  The director of program management of  Blue Cross Blue Shield-affiliated company functioning at the managed stage reports that the portfolio process helps with project selection: The nature of our organization makes it hard to tie everything to an ROI 


-  So we use alternatives to measure the impact of IT investments ,  such as the time it takes our associates to access information when taking member service calls 


-  We also look at data from satisfaction surveys among our constituents 


-  Those analyses translate into benefits-realization reviews at the end of each project 


-  ,  The most savvy IT management teams distinguish themselves by their ability to align investment portfolios with business strategy 


-  And to increase the aggregate value of their IT investments ,  they assess both the risks associated with each project  ( delays ,  cost overruns ,  strategic misalignment ,  end-user acceptance )  and the portfolio risks  ( the blend of run the business innovation and breakthrough innovation )  


-  Synchronized companies also are disciplined about getting frequent feedback from business-unit heads and corporate-strategy vice presidents to ensure that IT efforts stay aligned with strategy after investments are decided on 


-  ,   Fortune 500 consumer packaged-goods company offers  relevant example 


-  All potential IT projects costing over  predetermined amount  often $250 , 000  go through  rigorous vetting process 


-  Required to have  valid business rationale with an NPV or internal rate of return  ( IRR )  calculation ,  each project is screened relative to the companys existing and planned infrastructure 


-  Then  cross-functional executive team evaluates each one using  Balanced Scorecard approach that captures the various dimensions of business value ,  risk and ability to succeed 


-  The enterprise has  process guide with detailed grading for each category on the scorecard ,  ensuring consistent scoring and optimal alignment with the organizations key business objectives 


-  Plotting projects on  matrix of value to the business vs 


-  risk helps companies such as this visualize the project portfolios viability 


-  )  ,  The consumer-goods company reported convening  senior management council  business-unit vice presidents plus the CFO and the CIO  to review projects 


-  Six criteria related to the 2002 strategic objectives were weighed: financial return ,  consumer focus ,  supply-chain business benefit ,  technology efficiency ,  knowledge advantage and work-life balance 


-  In 2002 ,  89% of the IT investments went to the top 50 firmwide projects vs 


-  There was better alignment and wider support from senior business management 


-  An interesting side effect: The CFO and business-unit heads ,  upon reviewing the portfolio of potential projects ,  increased overall IT spending to fund additional high-value projects 


-  ,  The more successful companies therefore link strategy to IT portfolio investments using  process similar to one first laid out in the late 1990s: Define the companywide strategic intent and business objectives; understand the strategic context of the company; develop business and IT objectives matched to corporate strategic objectives; develop an appropriate portfolio of business and IT investments to support the strategic business objective; and keep updating 


-  Says John Boushy ,  senior vice president of operations ,  Every project has  business case 


-  We ask ,  What is the business need? What does the business owner want the technology to do or the investment of information technology to provide? If it provides that ,  what are the business outcomes that will change? For example ,  what will change in terms of customer satisfaction? What will change in terms of increased revenues? What will change in terms of decreased costs? Then on the basis of the total cost of ownership of putting the investment in place ,  they ask ,  What is the increased support and infrastructure that might be required? Every project goes through such an analysis 


-  We track our scores by Gold ,  Platinum and Diamond Rewards customer-tier levels ,  segmented by predicted customer lifetime value ,  and we actually look at the customer satisfaction scores that occur as we implement  service-improvement initiative 


- com eTotal Rewards Web portal that lets customers see their personalized offers and update their account information online 


-  Says Boushy ,  Weve been able to quantify the value of increasing the satisfaction level of  customer from   to an A: It represents an annual increase in revenue of about 6% from that specific customer 


-  ,  Data analysis from the survey uncovered  statistical link between  synchronized ITPM process and return-on-asset  ( ROA )  performance 


-  The research involved multivariable regression analysis for responding companies 


-  The dependent performance variable was ROA ,  and the independent variables included such factors as IT spending as  percentage of revenue plus  special ITPM score 


-  For companies with large investments in IT ,   synchronized ITPM process appeared to impact ROA measurably ,  but simply defining and managing the ITPM process is not enough to improve performance significantly 


-  Qualitative data analysis of the interview transcripts revealed what the interviewees considered to be the top 10 benefits of ITPM 


-  The benefit valued most was improved business-strategy alignment 


-  Next came centralized control and ,  in descending order ,  cost reduction ,  communication with business executives ,  improved ROI ,  improved customer service ,  professional respect ,  competitive advantage ,  IT integration during mergers and acquisitions ,  and finally ,  improved decision making 


-  ,  Lynne Ellyn ,  senior vice president and CIO at DTE Energy ,   Michigan-based energy and energy-technology provider ,  described the benefits of ITPM: Our portfolio-management approach has been instrumental in cutting costs by 40% over the last two years and increasing productivity 


-  We have developed strong application-development and project-management skills 


-  We are training other parts of the organization in project-management techniques 


-  Ellyn also reported increased company recognition for the IT groups capabilities and said she is often asked to consult on non-IT issues ,  such as reviews of  recent plan for  power-plant construction project 


-  ,  ITPM can be instrumental in improving communication between business units and IT 


-  ,  Similarly ,  at  leading wireless-services provider ,  portfolio analysis helped identify between $50 million and $75 million in savings from eliminating system and platform redundancies 


-  ,  Our research also revealed how  lack of ITPM could hurt companies after mergers and acquisitions 


-  ,  the largest waste-management-services company in the United States ,  with $11 billion in revenues in 2002 ,  is the result of  series of acquisitions 


-  But the companys aggressive growth strategy hit the skids in the late 1990s 


-  Former Waste Management CIO Tom Smith ,  who joined the company in 1999 ,  said ,  The merger of the prior Waste Management with USA Waste Services in mid-1998 failed ,  and to  large extent this was due to the lack of  common systems foundation 


-  That resulted in the company being unable to manage its resources and measure performance 


-  For example ,  the lack of standardization in the numerous accounting systems meant that  , 100 external consultants and staff had to spend weeks to close the companys books for year-end 1999 


-  ,  When Smith came aboard ,  his main challenge was to create an IT platform that would integrate the independent entities into  united network 


-  Quite simply ,  Smith says ,  the company needed IT systems and processes to gain control of managing the business and the associated metrics to effectively measure the business units performance 


-  Smith believes that the portfolio-management principles used in managing IT spending helped him do exactly that 


-  Waste Management now closes its books in  timely manner ,  drives out costs ,  focuses on improved customer service and ,  most important ,  captures adequate information to run the business 


-  Though it is speculation at this point ,  having had such systems and processes in place might have prevented the companys control gaps and subsequent downfall in 1998 


-  The first two barriers are essentially about poor execution ,  the third relates to the deep-rooted divide between business and IT 


-  ,  As many as 82% of survey respondents identified the ability to estimate IT benefits as  major challenge; 33% never established baselines to compare outcomes against; 30% said project scope changed too often; and 13% said investments lacked known objectives on which to base evaluation 


-  ,  Three examples from the insurance industry indicate the opportunity cost 


-   smaller ,  regional property and casualty  ( P&C )  insurer found 30 full-time-equivalent  ( FTE )  years tied up in two wayward projects lacking ties to business objectives 


-  ,   multinational P&C insurer having more than 20 million policyholders found that ,  in North America alone ,  it supported 375 business applications utilizing 56 development tools and 22 database engines 


-  Portfolio-level scrutiny helped identify six out of 34 capability needs as truly critical  ( for example ,  improved policy underwriting and processing )  ,  so the company was able to prioritize and consolidate application maintenance and development efforts 


-  Detailed analysis revealed its spending was excessive when compared with industry peers as well as many tactical savings opportunities 


-  For example ,  the company was using internal resources to train contractors who were also invoicing training time as billable hours 


-  ,  The percentage of respondents reporting that their IT staff lacked basic working knowledge of financial concepts was 46%; 37% reported frequent staff turnover; 28% said their companies lacked staff and resources to gather data; and 18% said their organization did not provide relevant training 


-  ,  Survey respondents cited  general lack of respect for IT plus communication problems between the CIO and business executives 


-  Interviews revealed that some business leaders ,  in an effort not to expose their ignorance of IT ,  wasted resources by deciding on initiatives without IT consultation ,  then demanded that IT groups manage the projects well or take the blame 


-  Meanwhile ,  some CIOs thought keeping business leaders technologically uninformed translated to job security and thus took little initiative to bridge the divide 


-  ,  Forty-six percent said business leaders didnt understand that ROI is not always applicable 


-  For example ,   manufacturing companys CIO recalled how ,  until auditors finally expressed their concern ,  fellow executives continually dismissed project proposals for security and disaster-recovery assets because they couldnt see immediate bottom-line benefits 


-  As many as 36% of respondents saw  lack of mutual respect between IT and business executives; 30% perceived business leaders as lacking basic technological understanding; and 28% said business executives regarded IT as  necessary evil 


-  ,  Significantly ,  the research reveals  significant skills gap 


-  As many as 46% of respondents agreed that IT staff lack working knowledge of financial concepts 


-  Although most IT staff know what NPV is and how to calculate it ,  they have trouble making  strong business case in partnership with business-unit executives 


- 12 But ,  as the consumer packaged-goods company found ,  making  strong case can lead to executives increasing resources for high-value projects 


-   cross-functional approach that involves IT ,  finance and lines of business is essential 


-  ,  As the CIO of  major manufacturing company explained in an interview ,  The business side did not realize how critical their involvement was 


-  In addition ,  our attitude was  Call me if you have  problem kind of thing 


-  Two things made  difference 


-  Second ,  we realized that both the IT and business people would gradually come around 


-  ,  Resistance to  centralized ITPM process sometimes comes from managers fear of losing budgetary ownership 


-  As the CIO of  major financial-services firm observed ,  Each business unit would manage its own IT budget 


-  They saw corporate IT as taking away their flexibility ,  their independence ,  their freedom 


-  It was  big concern for them ,  and it took us four years to change their mind-set 


-  ,  By its very nature ,  ITPM risks being viewed as  corporate project by the troops ,  and greater transparency is not always welcomed 


-  So the company always had this perception that we were  really low spender in IT just because it wasnt visible 


-  ,  The ambiguity inherent in quantifying ITs business value ,  the lack of communication ,  executives limited understanding of and low respect for IT ,  and IT staffers inadequate business skills  all translate to major organizational challenges for successful implementation 


-  However ,  analysis of practices in the best-managed companies surveyed suggests four approaches that work: staged implementation strategy ,  creating  process for upgrading ITPM ,  ensuring that staff members are trained  and involving business-side people from the beginning 


-  ,  Consistent messages heard throughout the research were that ITPM should be phased in iteratively and that performance feedback is critical 


-  Says John Boushy of Harrahs ,  First ,  [IT portfolio management] instills the discipline of making sure that we are investing in those projects that are floated by the needs of the business and create  tangible return  as evidenced by the business case that has to be developed 


-  At  later stage ,  that discipline then leads to not just evaluating projects on the front end ,  but comparing what the actual performance is on the back end 


-  ,  Most synchronized-level respondents weighed the following four dimensions in deciding how to stage implementation 


-  ,  Successful practitioners focused on specific parts of the organization  ( or budget )  rather than taking on the entire company 


-  Making ITPM work in one business unit or department helped win over skeptics and deter turf battles 


-  Thus the first stage addressed only application-development projects 


-  In the second stage ,  the company added infrastructure assets to the portfolio 


-  The research uncovered portfolio scorecards with as many as 400 metrics 


-  For example ,  if  strategic initiative is to increase operational effectiveness ,   corresponding metric is increase in inventory turns 


-  ,   key feature of  well-managed portfolio is having distinct sets of metrics for different types of investments 


-  One organization ,  for example ,  measures expected risk and return of  project in the planning phase ,  then measures earned value in the delivery phase  and employee productivity during the maintenance phase 


-  ,  The most accomplished ITPM practitioners follow  well-defined process to implement capability upgrades 


-  )  ,  First is design ,  which defines the right objectives and secures buy-in from business leaders 


-  During the second step ,  diagnosis ,   new portfolio baseline is established ,  and the facts to be used in decision making are agreed on 


-  Business units usually apply different IT budget categories: One counts telecommunications as IT ,  while another does not 


-  That results in  mismatch of portfolio data that must be resolved 


-  Those that were redundant or lacked clear links to business objectives were terminated 


-  ,  Portfolio analysis revealed ,  for example ,  that the automaker had myriad product and services vendors working on conflicting and redundant projects under blanket purchase orders without any specific objectives or deliverables 


-  Among the underlying issues: aging legacy systems that are unable to keep up with rapid demand growth; lack of  common technology platform to support business with 500 dealers;  decentralized management structure without incentives for cross-enterprise coordination; and  consensus-based culture averse to transformational change or termination of projects 


-  ,  Recognizing it was misspending IT dollars ,  the car company set out to create an inventory of all projects ,  reassess business-capability needs and develop an investment-prioritization and decision-making mechanism 


-  This resulted in ranking 352 discrete projects and 58 capability needs  ( for example ,  the capability to configure models ,  parts and accessories online )  against six weighted prioritization criteria  ( for example ,  strategic fit ,  with  5% weight; business economics ,  50% weight; and operational impact ,  20% weight )  


-  Each criterion was built from two to nine questions  each translating to  10-point scale  such as Does this project address an identified need? What is our expected payback period? and What is the expected risk- and time-adjusted return on investment? In the end ,  only five of those 58 desired capabilities were judged to be business-critical 


-  The most highly valued capability among synchronized practitioners studied was to excel at measuring and managing the risk of project failure 


-   risk-management strategy for each project can significantly improve project success rates and may require relatively little effort compared with the cost of large projects 


-   simple but effective method is to plot possible risk events on the dimensions of probability of occurrence and severity of consequences 


-  Then specific contingencies can be put in place to deal with risks that have  high level of severity 


-  Approaches such as the Balanced Scorecard can help quantify the extent to which projects are aligned with strategic objectives ,  adding rigor to prioritizing 


-  ,  The key to bridging the business-technology divide and improving results is early communication 


-  Not only must senior business managers understand more about how IT affects both strategy and the bottom line ,  but CIOs also need to learn to communicate the vision ,  strategies and goals of the IT organization in terms that non-IT executives can understand 


-  The most effective partnerships studied were those in which the CIO took the initiative in engaging business leaders about ITPM and eventually transferred accountability to the business 


-  A major step in making business collaboration work was to stop referring to [ITPM] as an IT project ,  said the CIO of  large capital-goods manufacturer 


-  ,  Although only 17% of the organizations polled are at the synchronized stage ,  the prize for that 17% appears to be substantial and suggests that becoming synchronized is the right move for others 


-  The most successful practitioners experienced cost savings of up to 40% of pre-ITPM budgets ,  better alignment between IT spending and business objectives ,  and greater central coordination of IT investments across the organization 


-  By following the steps to establish or upgrade ITPM and by benchmarking against synchronized companies ,  large organizations can make IT an integral part of their competitive advantage
