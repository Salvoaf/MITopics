-   company can achieve low cost by aggressively reducing costs or differentiate by creating something that is perceived industrywide as unique 


-  ,  Although the best-product strategy continues to be relevant ,  our research shows that it does not describe all the ways companies compete in the current environment 


-  The new model fills  significant void in the development of strategic thinking by offering three potential options: best product ,  customer solutions ,  and system lock-in 


-  The best-product strategic option is built on the classic forms of competition through low cost or differentiation 


-   company can differentiate by enhancing product attributes in  way that adds value for the customer 


-  Every strategic option searches for  way to bond with the customer ,  which is reflected in  significant switching cost 


-  Through the best-product option ,  companies bond with customers through the intrinsic superiority of their product or service 


-  ,  The customer solutions strategic option is based on  wider offering of products and services that satisfies most if not all the customers needs 


-  The focus here is on the customers economics ,  rather than the products economics 


-   company might offer  broad bundle of products and services that is targeted and customized to  specific customers needs 


-  In that respect ,  the most relevant performance measurement of this option is customer market share 


-  Learning has  dual effect: the investment the customer makes in learning how to use  product or service can constitute  significant switching cost; learning about customer needs will increase the companys ability to satisfy his or her requirements 


-  Often this strategic option calls for the development of partnerships and alliances ,  which could include other suppliers ,  competitors ,  and customers linked by their ability to complement  customer offering 


-  Instead of narrowly focusing on the product or the customer ,  the company considers all the meaningful players in the system that contribute to the creation of economic value 


-  The company is particularly concerned with nurturing ,  attracting ,  and retaining so-called complementors ,  along with the normal industry participants 


-  The critical issue here is looking at the overall architecture of the system: How can  company gain complementors share in order to lock out competitors and lock in customers? The epitome of this position is achieving the de facto proprietary standard 


-  ,  Although ,  in reality ,  these options are not mutually exclusive ,  and  business could decide on  blended strategy ,  it is useful to consider the three alternatives as distinct ways of competing ,  with different scope ,  scale ,  and bonding  ( see Figure  )  


-  At the extreme end of the best-product position ,  where  company often opts for low cost ,  the scope is trimmed to  minimum 


-  The scope expands to include product features as  company moves to  differentiated best-product position 


-  It further expands beyond the product to include the customers activities in the case of customer solutions 


-  ,  Scale is  critical strategic factor typically measured as product market share ,  which is appropriate when evaluating  best-product position 


-  In the case of customer solutions ,   company must consider its share of  customers purchases 


-  For  system lock-in position ,  complementor share is the most crucial consideration 


-  ,  Ultimately ,  bonding deals with the forces that link the product or service with the customer 


-  In the best-product option ,  this is done through the characteristics of the product itself 


-  The customer solutions position achieves this through learning and customization 


-  The objective of its classic best-product strategy is to be the lowest cost producer in the steel industry 


-  It has achieved this performance through  single-minded focus on product economics 


-  Throughout the corporation ,  there is  strong alignment between the objectives and metrics critical to the strategy ,  namely ,  to be low cost ,  and to the measurements and incentives for teams and individuals 


-  ,  Southwest Airlines is another example of phenomenal performance through  best-product strategy 


-  ,  This competitive position reflects  shift in strategic attention from product to customer  from product economics to customer economics and the customers experience 


-  ,  Electronic Data Systems  ( EDS )  is  clear example of  customer solutions provider 


-  Its role is to provide the best solutions to cover total information needs ,  regardless of the components origins 


-  In the process ,  it has built  highly respected record by delivering cost-effective and tailor-made solutions to each customer 


-  While once IT was regarded as the brain of the company and every firm developed its own strong ,  internal IT group ,  now IT outsourcing is commonplace and even expected 


-  ,  As  customer solutions provider ,  EDS measures its success by how much it improves the customers bottom line or how it enhances the customers economics 


-  EDS achieves these gains by extending the scope of its services to include activities previously performed by the customer 


-  By focusing on IT ,  operations scale ,  and experience relative to the customer ,  it can offer services at  lower cost and/or higher quality than the customers themselves can 


-  ,  MCI WorldCom provides  contrasting example of  customer solutions position 


-  Where EDS has built value by vertically expanding its service scope into activities previously performed by the customer ,  MCI WorldCom is an almost pure example of expanding horizontally across  range of related services for the targeted customer segment ,  or bundling 


-  It bundles the services together to reduce complexity for the customer 


-  The customer benefits from  single bill ,  one contact point for customer service and sales ,  and potentially  more integrated ,  highly utilized network ,  but the products are the same 


-  MCI WorldCom benefits through higher revenue per customer and longer customer retention ,  because it is harder to change vendors ,  and through lower cost customer service and sales 


-  It is shifting the dimension of competitive advantage from product share to customer share 


-  ,  Saturn ,  another example of the customer solutions position ,  is one of the most creative managerial initiatives in the past ten years 


-  It abandoned  focus on products and turned its attention to changing the customers full life-cycle experience 


-  Inherently ,  Saturn abandoned the best-product strategy and decided to create  product that was no different from the leading competition 


-  ,  Instead ,  Saturn redefined the terms of engagement with the customer at the dealership 


-  Saturn targeted its dealers from  list of the top  percent of dealers in the United States ,  regardless of the brands they represented 


-  Saturn offered extraordinary terms ,  which required  major commitment from the dealers to learn the Saturn culture and to make multimillion-dollar investments in the dealership 


-  ,  First ,  and not just symbolically ,  Saturn changed the name dealer ,  with the implicit connotation of negotiation and haggling ,  to retailer ,  which connotes loyalty and fairness 


-  In fact ,  the dealers educated customers on the features and price of the car and how they compared to competitors 


-  Saturn also established  complete rezoning and expansion of retailer areas ,  thus limiting competition and allowing for more effective use of  central warehouse that  circle of Saturn dealers could share to lower inventory and costs 


-  Additionally ,  it broke with tradition in the auto industry by offering  remarkable deal: Satisfaction guaranteed ,  or your money back ,  with no questions asked 


-  It replaced the complete car ,  not simply  component ,  and issued the recall within two weeks of finding symptoms of the problem 


-  ,  Not surprisingly ,  customer response was overwhelming ,  creating what has become  cult among Saturn owners and thus giving Saturn the highest customer satisfaction rating in the industry   phenomenal accomplishment for  car that retails for about one-fourth the price of luxury cars 


-  Saturns most powerful advertising campaign became the word of mouth from pleased customers ,  proving that focusing on the customer can be as strong  force in achieving competitive advantage as focusing on the product 


-  As  customer ,  if you want access to the majority of the applications ,  you have to buy  Microsoft Windows operating system; 90 percent do 


-  Microsoft and Intel do not win on the basis of product cost ,  product differentiation ,  or  customer solution; they have system lock-in 


-  Its strategy was to serve high-end business people ,  particularly those traveling abroad 


-  The well-known slogan ,  Dont leave home without it ,  and  worldwide array of American Express offices helped Amex achieve something close to  customer solutions position 


-  They created  virtuous loop  consumers prefer the cards accepted by the majority of the merchants ,  and merchants prefer the card held by the majority of the customers 


-  The right option for  firm depends on its particular circumstances 


-  The economic implications of the best-product position are shown in Part  of the figure 


-  This is why the alternative to low cost must be differentiation ,  offering unique product attributes that the customer values and will pay  premium for 


-  While the graph is simplistic ,  it represents important economic hurdles: to have  genuine low-cost position ,   company needs to demonstrate lower relative unit costs; to have the economic leverage of  differentiated product ,   company needs to show clearly that the customer will pay more ,  and that this premium is more than the added costs 


-  ,  By contrast ,  the customer solutions position  ( shown in Part  of Figure  )  centers on how products and services will impact the customer economics ,  either by lowering the customers internal costs or by allowing the customers to have higher revenue 


-  The customer solutions provider may have higher costs ,  but these are far outweighed by the economic contributions to the customer 


-  The economic hurdle here is to show measurable and positive impact on the customers profit 


-  Bonding is  continuum that extends from the customers first loyalty to  product to full system lock-in with proprietary standards 


-  ,  In the first stage ,  dominant design ,  customers are attracted to  product because it uniquely excels in the dimensions they deeply care about 


-  If the strategic positioning is differentiation ,  the features or services that accompany the product could attract and retain the customer 


-  Product variety eventually consolidates to  common design that has the features and characteristics that customers expect from the product type 


-  ,  This emerging dominant design fills the requirements of many users for  particular product ,  although it may not exactly meet the requirements of any particular segment of the customer base 


-  In that regard ,  the dominant design is generic and standardized as opposed to customized 


-  The competitor generating this design captures the first element of loyalty from customers and has first-mover advantage 


-  They came together to define the ideal PC for the market ,  which every other PC-compatible manufacturer would later have to emulate 


-  ,  Beyond the stage of dominant design ,  there are clear opportunities to achieve higher ,  more tangible switching costs on the part of the customer 


-  One such move is to enhance the products inherent characteristics by offering additional support that makes it more accessible and attractive and thus harder to switch from ,  thereby locking in the customer 


-  Ownership of distribution channels ,  of specialized salesforces ,  and of technical support staff and ,  very importantly ,   brand-supporting image can significantly increase product function ,  make it more appealing to the customer ,  and make the whole package more difficult to imitate 


-  Brands as  collateral asset can reinforce lock-in when the product is unfamiliar and the functionality unknown ,  so that the assurance of support can dissipate doubts about product performance and encourage repeat purchase 


-  ,  National Starch ,   customer solutions company ,  provides an excellent example of customer lock-in 


-  The source of its success is its extraordinary technological capabilities coupled with an intimate knowledge of all its key customers 


-  R&D personnel ,  technical service staff ,  and marketing and sales managers have accumulated enormous knowledge on customer needs ,  the state of new product development ,  and ways to aid customers in revenue expansion and cost containment 


-  The essence of National Starchs business is  joint working relationship with the customer 


-  The moral here is that by creatively constructing  tight working relationship with the customer ,   company can decommoditize  product 


-  The bonds are strong because the company is not only providing  product but embracing the customers own activities and enhancing its economics 


-  ,  Price structure can influence bonding with customers as well 


-  ,  Customized products and services can also lock in customers ,  through personalized services ,  customer care ,  and even billing 


-  In the consumer market for the financial services industry ,  Merrill Lynch first introduced customer management accounts ,  but Fidelity ,  Schwab ,  and other institutions followed 


-  The accounts are tailored to the users circumstances; characteristics of bill payment ,  brokerage ,  mutual fund investments ,  IRA accounts ,  credit cards ,  and checking accounts are specific to and chosen by the customer 


-  The effort to move this information to  new account creates  switching cost for the customer 


-  ,  Another benefit of close customer proximity is that the customer and the supplier bond over time 


-  ,  There is  thin line between locking in customers and locking out competitors 


-  First ,  once  company acquires  customer ,  it is hard for that customer to switch to an alternative 


-  Physical distribution channels ,  in particular ,  are limited in their ability to handle multiple product lines 


-  They create customer demand that causes retailers to stock the branded product ,  at the expense of competitive products ,  given the physical constraints 


-  This reinforcing loop causes branding to be particularly effective for consolidating share and creating system lock-in when the industry structure includes physical distribution channels; this is in contrast to an industry that uses expandable channels such as telemarketing or direct mail 


-  First ,  customer switching costs need to be high 


-  ,  Complexity and uncertainty in the market create  problem in implementing any plan 


-  Strategy needs to adapt continuously ,  and therefore implementation itself needs to respond to market changes and to an improved understanding of the market 


-  That understanding becomes apparent only during implementation 


-  ,  In the Delta model ,  adaptive processes link strategy with execution by:  (  )  defining the key business processes that are the repository of the primary operational tasks ,  (  )  aligning their role with the desired strategic position ,  (  )  seeking  coherent integration across these processes to produce unifying action ,  and  (  )  incorporating responsive mechanisms as  core part of each process to ensure flexibility and change in an uncertain market 


-  Not only does the role of each process need to adapt to each strategic option ,  but also the priorities with regard to each are affected 


-  ,  When operational effectiveness supports  best-product strategy ,  it is imperative to reduce the product costs by paying careful attention to the drivers of that cost 


-  However ,  in the case of customer solutions ,  operational effectiveness is also concerned with the horizontal linkages between products in the bundled offer 


-  The ultimate goal is to improve the customers economics ,  even if that sometimes raises the products costs 


-  The relevant cost focus is the combined impact on the customers business and the companys 


-  ,  For example ,   data communications provider of private lines seeking  best-product position would focus on reducing maintenance costs to  minimum ,  given certain quality guidelines 


-   customer solutions provider would look closely at the customers activities 


-  It would reduce the customers costs by adding equipment to diagnose  problem or perhaps by adding large-scale alternate backup systems 


-  In intranet services ,  in which  customer buys  highly secure private-line network using Internet protocols ,   company might attempt  system lock-in position 


-  Establishing  low-cost infrastructure is less important than encouraging the customer to install more sites and to use more applications that run on an intranet platform 


-  ,  When supporting  customer solutions position ,  companies seek to target key customers by offering  bundled solution ,  either alone or through alliances 


-  ,  Channel ownership itself becomes an issue ,  in order to gain greater knowledge and access to the customer 


-  This allowed Merck to obtain the leading mail-order catalog ,  have access to unique distribution ,  and gain ownership of  customer database covering patients ,  physicians ,  and proprietary formulary 


-  ,  When locking in  system ,  the key customer targets are the complementors ,  so the company can consolidate the lock-in position and neutralize competitors actions 


-  In short ,  the targeted customer is fundamentally different in these three options 


-  For example ,  we all know that its customers do not universally love Microsoft 


-  ,  In the software industry ,  software game providers typically adhere to  best-product strategic position and target customers as  way to get access to as many customers as possible 


-  American Management Systems ,  which has  customer solutions position ,  implements customized software and thus targets vertical markets 


-  ,  When it comes to supporting  best-product strategy ,  renewal of the business is seen in terms of securing  continuous stream of products ,  often by sharing  common platform 


-  If truly successful ,  that innovation will lead to establishment of  dominant design that represents the strongest base for competitive advantage with  best-product strategy 


-  In the case of the customer solutions strategy ,  innovation plays an important role through the successful development of joint products with key customers 


-  In this respect ,  this adaptive process is central not only for developing future customers ,  but for maintaining current ones 


-  Furthermore ,  the customer is the primary source of innovation ,  not the conventional R&D labs 


-  These two companies have chosen the best-product position and pursue innovation to support their competitive advantage 


-  ,  Motorolas semiconductor business follows  customer solutions strategy that focuses on the automobile industry ,  among others 


-  Some might insist on giving equal importance to each process and argue for the criticality of simultaneously having low cost ,  excellent customer targeting ,  and superior innovation 


-  Accordingly ,  the best-product position needs the lowest cost infrastructure ,  which originates in the operational effectiveness process 


-  Finally ,  the customer targeting process ensures the massive access to distribution channels 


-  ,  The customer solutions position has the effective targeting of the customer as its first priority 


-  Second ,  the operational effectiveness process ensures the delivery of the products and services to improve the customer economics 


-  Innovation has the third ranking ,  not because it is unimportant for joint product development with the customer ,  but because the customer solutions position does not necessarily require leadership in new products ,  services ,  and features relative to that called for in the other strategic positions 


-  Often the new product capabilities to support this strategy originate through alliances and the close collaboration with the customer 


-  As actions are tested and their merits or limitations become apparent ,  managers can understand more deeply the business issues they intend to solve 


-  For example ,  Capital One ,   leader in the credit card industry ,  strongly emphasizes customer targeting 


-  It has realized huge competitive advantage by recognizing that the credit card industry isnt one market ,  but millions 


-  The lynchpin of Capital Ones customer targeting process is scientific trials ,  testing ,  and feedback 


-  Next ,  they vary the core offer along the key dimensions  product ,  price ,  promotion ,  and channel  and identify  range of customer cells for test marketing 


-  Then they screen the results to select the offers with the highest profit or net present value in view of the full customer life cycle 


-  Capital One dissects profitability down to the smallest micro-segment ,  for example ,  types of customers ,  frequency of use ,  type of use  ( credit or transactions )  ,  bill paying ,  tenure ,  and costs of acquiring the customer 


-  Having the right data is clearly important because acquisition costs have risen from $40 to more than $200 per customer during the past ten years 


-  Capital One designs  family of offers with the understanding that they will not necessarily be successful ,  but that they provide seeds for future success 


-  This approach contrasts starkly with the conventional trial ,  in which  company launches  test of one product variation to  nonsegmented group of customers 


-  ,  All three adaptive processes have common responsive mechanisms for obtaining feedback: ,  Metrics are fundamental to the Delta model; they chart the course for implementing the desired strategic position and are at the heart of adaptation 


-  Unfortunately ,  most business are limited in their ability to identify and track effective performance metrics ,  for two key reasons 


-  In the case of customer solutions ,  it also allows inquiry into the best way to add value to the customer by quantifying the economics of the value chain and how alternative products affect it 


-  Likewise ,  customer targeting goes beyond the stereotype of customer identification and prioritization to get to the roots of customer profitability and the ability to appropriate system profits 


-  Finally ,  innovation is not simply  process of new product development but also  way to secure customer bonding and competitive lock-out 


-  ,  Aggregation is the second reason that conventional metrics are inadequate 


-  Some of the high costs were caused by the people involved and some by the particular facility 


-  Figure 10 shows  huge variation in profit margin by individual credit-card customers 


-  The customers were ranked from most to least profitable 


-  The top 10 percent of the customers contributed 99 percent of the business profits ,  the next 10 percent accounted for 43 percent of additional profits ,  and the next 16 percent of the customers added 25 percent more 


-  Only 36 percent of the customers contributed to profitability and collectively accounted for 167 percent of the business profits 


-  Unfortunately ,  the remaining 64 percent of the customers produced losses equivalent to 67 percent of the total profits 


-  ,  While many companies tend to dwell on one measure of customer attractiveness ,  we found that no one factor adequately explains the variation in customer profitability 


-   high-usage customer can be unprofitable due to low outstanding balances 


-  Given high acquisition costs ,   long-time customer can make  low-balance customer profitable 


-  ,  Business has become  complex interaction of many employees ,  customers ,  suppliers ,  teams ,  procedures ,  and processes ,  with each unit operating according to straightforward rules 


-  It recognizes customer-focused options and the emergence of proprietary standards to create an unassailable competitive advantage 


-  ,   firms day-to-day activities need to change to realize the different strategies described by aligning the adaptive processes with the strategic positions 


-  The Delta model deals with complexity by providing  rich overall framework that integrates  firms options and activities without running the risk of oversimplifying the context in which it makes decisions
