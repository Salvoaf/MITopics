- It is hardly  novel insight that global competitive forces compel multinationals to fully leverage the distinctive resources ,  knowledge ,  and expertise residing in their subsidiary operations 


-  The key question we address here is just that: What does it take for multinationals to successfully execute global strategies? ,  Our research results paint  striking picture of the importance of the strategy-making process itself for effective global strategy execution 


-  Over the last four years ,  we have done extensive research to understand how multinationals can successfully implement global strategies 


-  They were equally quick to add that they did not believe these control mechanisms alone to be either sufficient or that effective 


-  The general consensus was that these mechanisms were not particularly motivating and were easy to dodge and cheat 


-  Even more recurrent in our discussions ,  however ,  were the dynamics of the global strategic decision-making process itself 


-  Their overriding concern involved  deceptively simple though evidently profound principle: due process should be exercised in the global strategic decision-making process 


-  ,  In short ,  we observed that ,  in the absence of these factors ,  subsidiary top managers were often upset and negatively disposed toward resulting strategic decisions 


-  However ,  in the presence of these factors ,  the reaction was just the reverse 


-  Our initial objective was to get subsidiary presidents honest evaluation of the factors that drove them to carry out or resist their organizations global strategic decisions 


-  What is interesting is that these five characteristics were important regardless of the industry or the subsidiarys strategic importance 


-  ,  This statement indicates subsidiary top managers attitudes when the head office lacks knowledge of the local market 


-  One manager explains why local familiarity is important: ,  When subsidiary managers believe the head office has  reasonable grasp of the local situation ,  they are apt to make statements like this one: ,  What it comes down to is that in the absence of local familiarity ,  subsidiary top managers do not judge the head office to be competent and sincere 


-  They tend to think of the head office instead as incapable and apathetic toward their foreign operation 


-  At the most ,  local familiarity gives confidence that global strategies are based on thoughtful analyses; at the least ,  it prevents subsidiary managers from using this seemingly reasonable justification for not executing global strategic decisions 


-  ,  When global strategic decisions are being made that affect  subsidiary unit ,  subsidiary top managers value the ability to voice their opinion and work back and forth with the head office in decision formulation 


-  This communication symbolizes the respect the head office has for subsidiary units as well as the confidence it places in subsidiary managers opinions and insights 


-  Although two-way communication often results in heated debates ,  it also builds  profound spirit of comradeship ,  unity ,  and mutual trust among the head office and subsidiary top management teams 


-  One says: ,  The other says: ,  These two comments shed light on why consistent decision-making practices across subsidiary units are  prized aspect of due process 


-  Subsidiary managers do not expect the strategic decisions made across subsidiary units to be identical ,  as they understand that units are not equally important for the organization 


-  But they do view the consistent application of decision-making rules as an essential element of due process 


-  ,  In the absence of consistency ,  subsidiary managers are quick to judge the decision-making process as arbitrary ,  politically rigged ,  and hence not to be trusted 


-  Consequently ,  they become bitter and resentful and more apt to want to undermine resulting decisions 


-  Admittedly this can be traced in part to managers perceived increase in influence over strategic decisions ,  but our discussions suggest another reason why the ability to refute is important 


-  It makes managers feel that the process is fair simply because they can clearly point out possible mis-perceptions or wrong assumptions made by head office managers concerning local conditions or subsidiary operations 


-  But more than this ,  the ability to challenge head office decisions inspires subsidiary managers to more willingly follow these decisions because they know that if the decisions should prove unreasonable or wrongheaded ,  the possibility always exists to correct them 


-  As one executive explained: ,  Subsidiary top managers think it only fair that the head office give them an explanation for final global strategic decisions 


-  And they consider it an important aspect of due process 


-  In short ,  subsidiary managers need an intellectual understanding of the rationale driving ultimate decisions 


-  They want to know why they should carry out the decisions 


-  To quote one executive: ,  As our interviews with subsidiary presidents progressed and the meaning of due process became clear ,   second equally important trend became visible: those managers who believed that due process was exercised in their firms global strategy-making process were the same executives who trusted their head offices significantly ,  who were highly committed to their organizations ,  who felt  sense of comradeship or unity with the corporate center ,  and who were motivated to execute not only the letter but also the spirit of the decisions 


-  They are as follows: locate each value-added activity in the country that has the least cost for the factor that activity uses most intensely;4 dexterously shift capital and resources across national markets ,  cross-subsidizing global units ,  to knock out global competitors;5 institutionalize fully standardized product offerings ,  marketing approaches ,  and commonly used distribution systems worldwide to allow for maximum global efficiencies;6 and ,  as argued recently ,  consciously consolidate worldwide knowledge ,  technology ,  marketing ,  and production skills to build reservoirs of distinctive core competencies that can act as engines for continuous new business development ,  innovation ,  and enhanced customer value 


-  ,  Ask about any of these purported global strategies: What does it take to successfully execute it? Time and again the answer involves three underlying requirements:  (  )  the increasing sacrifice of subsystem for system priorities and considerations;  (  )  swift actions in  globally coordinated manner; and  (  )  effective and efficient exchange relations among the nodes of the multinationals global network 


-  Which is to say that to implement global strategies ,  multinationals need subsidiary managers with  sense of commitment ,  trust ,  and social harmony 


-  Organizational commitment inspires these managers to identify with the multinationals global objectives and to exert effort ,  accept responsibility ,  and exercise initiative on behalf of the overall organization despite potential costs at the subsidiary unit level 


-  Which is to say that trust is necessary for quick and coordinated global actions 


-  We are talking about commitment ,  trust ,  social harmony ,  and the motivation to execute not only the letter but also the spirit of decisions  that is ,  to engage in compulsory and voluntary execution of strategic decisions 


-  But as our discussions progressed ,  we found subsidiary presidents eager to add that they did not believe these implementation tools alone to be either sufficient or effective 


-  For one thing ,  they were not particularly motivating 


-  ,  This comment ,  made by one executive ,  is representative of the general opinion of most of the subsidiary presidents we interviewed 


-  The trouble ,  as we have already argued ,  is that to make global strategies work ,  subsidiary managers cannot simply execute this or undertake that in some highly prescribed manner 


-  ,  Global learning  the ability of  multinational to transfer the knowledge and expertise developed in each part of its global network to all other parts worldwide  has fast become an essential strategic asset 


- 10 For global learning to be actualized ,  we argue that nothing less than an affirmative attitude toward cooperation will suffice  that is ,  voluntary execution 


-  One reason for this is that knowledge and expertise are often viewed as power and as such are not easily shared 


-  Another reason is that the major benefits of internal diffusion of knowhow accrue to recipients ,  not transmitters 


-  Of course ,  were it possible for subsidiary units to sell their knowledge and expertise to other subsidiary units ,  these problems might be overcome 


-  As know-how is largely an intangible asset ,  its value to  purchasing unit cannot be known until the purchaser has it ,  but once the knowledge is disclosed ,  the purchaser has acquired it without cost 


- 11 In the absence of economic incentives and with the presence of perceived power disincentives to diffuse knowledge and expertise ,  it follows that full-blown global learning will not transpire as long as quid pro quo attitudes toward strategy execution prevail 


-  Rather ,  the hoarding and withholding of knowledge and expertise are far more likely 


-  ,  Beyond the fact that subsidiary managers do not consider these instrumental approaches to be that motivating is the reality that managers increasingly find these tools easy to dodge and cheat 


-  Basically ,  the decline in their effectiveness can be explained by the collapse of the three distinctive features of hierarchy in the modern multinational 


-  The predominant reason for this is the rapid increase in horizontal linkages and interdependencies across subsidiary units 


-  As subsidiary units increasingly share resources and work together on single projects to realize global economies of scale and scope ,  the unique performance and contribution of each subsidiary unit is increasingly difficult to decipher 


-  One reason for the erosion in the head offices hierarchical power is subsidiary units increasing size and resource parity 


-  The result is more antagonistic relations between head office and subsidiary top management teams and  natural inclination on the part of subsidiary managers to pursue subsidiary-level objectives 


-  But he argued that the execution of this mission would invalidate  sole reliance on stand-alone financial criteria for assessing his subsidiary units performance 


-  He proposed having his units performance evaluated also by the strategic contribution it made to the overall organization 


-  On the one hand ,  the effective implementation of global strategies requires  sense of community and cooperation among all the nodes of the multinationals global network 


-  This is not particularly conducive to efficient and effective exchange 


-  The first is that due process helps to overcome the exchange difficulties in the multinational by inspiring  sense of commitment ,  trust ,  and social harmony among subsidiary top managers 


-  They were intrigued by our proposition that instrumental calculations of gains and losses were not the dominant driver behind subsidiary managers actions and found it particularly interesting that subsidiary managers had placed so much emphasis on the importance of due process in global strategy making 


-  According to these executives ,  it was  challenging proposition that the presence or absence of due process had the power to influence not only the important attitudes of commitment ,  trust ,  and social harmony but also subsidiary managers actual execution of resulting decisions 


-  In short ,  we set out to examine whether due process exercised  positive overall effect not only on the commitment ,  trust ,  and social harmony of subsidiary top managers but also on compulsory and voluntary execution 


-  We also set out to test whether these effects were significantly stronger or particularly potent in those subsidiary managers who received unfavorable strategic decision outcomes vis--vis those who received favorable outcomes 


-  ,  The results of our regression analyses confirmed our observation that due process in global strategy making is indeed positively related to subsidiary managers sense of organizational commitment ,  trust in head office management ,  and social harmony between them and the head office 


- 01 )  , 19 which is to say that the more subsidiary managers believe that due process is exercised in the global strategy-making process ,  the more positive attitudes they have toward head office management and the organization as  whole 


-  We wanted to see the effect of due process when subsidiary managers judged strategic decisions to be favorable or unfavorable for their unit 


-  ,  During the course of our interviews ,  one of the most fascinating things we observed was that the effect of due process on subsidiary managers attitudes and behavior was particularly strong precisely in those individuals who received decision outcomes viewed as unfavorable 


- 20 Figures 3a through 3c show the average commitment ,  trust ,  and social harmony scores for subsidiary top managers receiving favorable versus unfavorable strategic decision outcomes 


-  As the figures consistently reveal ,  when decision outcomes were viewed as unfavorable ,  the exercise of due process did much to check discontent and to give loser subsidiary managers powerful reasons to stay committed to their organization  ( in Figure 3a ,  the mean commitment score increases from  


- 01 )  ,  to have trust in head office management  ( in Figure 3b ,  the mean trust score increases from  


-  In particular ,  as due process heightened ,  the mean score for commitment increased from  


- 01 )  ,  that for trust from  


- 24 As expected ,  with  low level of due process , subsidiary managers with unfavorable decision outcomes were generally dissatisfied with the head office and the overall organization and consequently felt  low level of commitment ,  trust ,  and social harmony 


-  There was little gap between those managers who had received favorable and unfavorable decision outcomes in their reported scores of commitment ,  trust ,  and social harmony and compulsory and voluntary execution; all these gaps proved to be statistically not significant  ( p> 


-  Moreover ,  whether managers received favorable or unfavorable outcomes ,  their degree of commitment ,  trust ,  and social harmony and compulsory and voluntary execution was much higher when due process was exercised in global strategy making than when it was not 


-  They feel  strong sense of organizational commitment ,  trust in head office management ,  and social harmony with their head office counterparts 


-  The power of due process in this regard is more remarkable when we consider our finding that voluntary execution was induced only by due process and not by the instrumental value of decision outcomes 


-  This diminishes fast their willingness to execute global strategies 


-  ,  But beyond this ,  what makes due process particularly significant for global strategy execution is that its effect on salutary attitudes and implementation behavior is especially strong in managers who receive unfavorable decision outcomes 


-  In one multinational we studied ,  subsidiary units were recently asked to forgo their national products in favor of global core products that many units considered to be either overstandardized or overpriced for their national markets 


-  It seems that subsidiary managers are both sensitive and responsive to issues of fairness in decision-making processes 


-  ,  We distributed the mail questionnaire to 195 subsidiary top managers 


-  This pool comprised the 63 subsidiary presidents who participated in our field research and 132 other subsidiary top managers who directly participated in the last annual global strategic decision-making process between the head office and their national unit 


-  These executives were considered to represent the key catalysts for global strategy execution in their national units 


-  ,  We distributed the questionnaire within six weeks of the completion of the last annual global strategic decision-making process of our nineteen participating multinationals 


-  Of the 195 questionnaires distributed ,  142 were returned to the researchers 


-  The questionnaire assessed the extent of due process in the last strategy-making process ,  subsidiary top managers attitudes of organizational commitment ,  trust ,  and social harmony ,  and the perceived favorability of strategic decision outcomes 


-  ,  Ten months later ,  just before the start of another annual global strategic decision-making process ,  we distributed  second questionnaire to the 142 managers who responded to our first-round questionnaire 


-  Of these ,  119 questionnaires were returned to the researchers and used in our analysis of the relationship between due process and compulsory and voluntary execution 


- 26 ,  To assess whether or to what extent due process was exercised in global strategic decision making ,  we used  five-item measure in our survey questionnaire 


- 27 This involved having subsidiary top managers evaluate on  seven-point Likert-type scale each of the five identified aspects of due process ,  in short:  (  )  the extent to which the head office is knowledgeable of the subsidiary units local situation;  (  )  the extent to which two-way communication exists in the process;  (  )  the extent to which the head office is fairly consistent in making global strategic decisions across subsidiary units;  (  )  the extent to which subsidiary top managers can legitimately challenge the strategic views and decisions of the head office; and  (  )  the extent to which subsidiary top managers receive  full explanation for global strategic decisions 


-  ,  To measure the trust subsidiary top managers have in the head office ,  we used four questions 


- 32 The managers were asked to think of their relations with head office management when answering the following items:  (  )  how well they help each other out;  (  )  how well they get along with one another;  (  )  how well they stick together; and  (  )  the extent to which conflict characterizes their relations 


-  ,  Four items assessed the perceived favorability of global strategic decisions received by subsidiary units as  result of the last annual global strategic decision-making process 


-  ,  To assess the extent to which each subsidiary top manager carried out global strategic decisions in accordance with their formally required corporate standards ,  two questions were posed 


-  First ,  for each of eight major activities  ( marketing and sales ,  research and development ,  manufacturing ,  purchasing ,  cost-reduction programs ,  general cash-flow utilization ,  human resource management ,  and other administrative activities )  ,  subsidiary top managers were asked to respond on  seven-point  ( 1=not at all ,  7=completely )  scale to the following question: Please try to recall as accurately as possible your overall behavior and actions taken since the preceding annual global strategic decision process between the head office and your national unit 


-  This assessment is important because although each of our respondents was  top manager with overarching responsibilities for and involvement in overall subsidiary unit operations across these activities ,  many reported having full responsibility for some activities but having only limited responsibility in the sense of giving final approval in other activities 


-  First ,  for each of the eight major activities ,  the managers were asked to respond on  seven-point scale  ( 1=not at all ,  7=greatly )  to the following question: Please try to recall as accurately as possible your overall behavior and actions taken since the preceding annual global strategic decision process between the head office and your national unit 


-  Rephrased ,  to what extent did you willingly exert energy ,  exercise initiative ,  and devote your effort beyond that which is formally required to achieve optimum performance in your execution of global strategic decisions in each of these activities? ,  Using the same question on dimensional importance described above for compulsory execution to obtain weights ,  we derived  weighted-average measure of each managers voluntary execution of global strategic decisions 


-  First ,  we performed regression analyses to see whether due process positively correlated with the managers attitudes of organizational commitment ,  trust in head office management ,  and social harmony between them and head office management and whether due process was also related to the managers compulsory and voluntary execution of the resulting decisions 


-  Finally ,  we calculated and compared the mean levels of reported organizational commitment ,  trust in head office management ,  social harmony ,  and compulsory and voluntary execution for each of our four groups: the high outcome favorability  high due process group; the high outcome favorability  low due process group; the low outcome favorability  high due process group; and the low outcome favorability  low due process group
