-  Characterized by the media mostly in terms of political turmoil ,  malnutrition ,  and AIDS ,  Africa seems inconsequential as  potential market or as  low-cost manufacturing source 


-  Yet several MNCs enjoy good ,  sustained profitability from their African operations 


-  In addition ,  substantial political and economic changes now underway in many African countries prompt  closer look at the business opportunities in this emerging continent of forty-nine very diverse nations 


-  ,  Our purpose here is to highlight these changes and to provide practical advice on business strategy ,  marketing ,  and organization to companies doing or considering doing business in Africa 


-  We focus on sub-Saharan Africa and therefore exclude the Arab countries of North Africa that are more often identified with the Middle East 


-  We studied  variety of firms ,  representing leading consumer ,  industrial ,  and service companies that are marketing and ,  in some cases ,  manufacturing in Africa 


-  ,  The commercial importance of Africa to multinationals is limited but increasing: ,  Despite these positive aspects ,  Africas poverty continues to constrain its economic attractiveness 


-  The rate of population growth continues to outpace gross domestic product  ( GDP )  


-  Kenyas population will double in the next eighteen years ,  but Kenyan food production in 1991 was 38 percent less per capita than it was forty years earlier 


-  In 1965 ,  when Ghana became independent ,  its GDP per capita was similar to South Koreas; today ,  it is less than 15 percent of South Koreas 


-  They need about one-fifth of their export earnings to service this debt; this is  significant drain ,  but less than the 25 percent that Latin America ,  South Asia ,  and the Middle East need to service their debts 


-  Sub-Saharan Africa is heavily dependent on foreign aid ,  which accounts for 10 percent of its GNP and absorbs 35 percent of all the aid to developing countries 


-  The regions share of world trade is less than half what it was  decade ago ,  partly due to declining world prices of commodities ,  which constitute 91 percent of their exports 


-  ,  The African countries that have achieved sustained economic growth are largely those blessed with commodities whose world market prices have remained strong 


-  Oil-rich Gabon ,  for example ,  has  higher per capita income than South Africa 


-  Few African countries have significantly developed their manufacturing sectors; for example ,  in the ten member states of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference  ( SADCC )  ,  only 12 percent of GDP is in manufacturing 


-  The food processing and textile industries dominate the manufacturing sector throughout sub-Saharan Africa 


-   vigorous informal economy of microenterprises generally exists as these populations struggle for their economic survival 


-  Half the FDI in African countries  compared to only 20 percent in non-African developing countries  continues to focus on mining and agriculture ,  reinforcing the commodity base of African economies 


-  Only  quarter of the FDI targets the manufacturing sector ,  with more emphasis until recently on inefficient import substitution than on production for export 


-  This pattern of FDI has limited the ability of African countries to capitalize on the generalized system of preferences  ( GSP )  that reduces tariffs mainly on industrial rather than commodity exports from developing to developed countries 


-  The developed world seems determined to retain protectionist tariffs and subsidies that limit imports of agricultural commodities and low-cost textiles ,  although the European Common Market does give preferential access to exports from its former colonies 


-  While some countries serve as important entrepts  ( such as Botswana between South Africa and the rest of black Africa )  ,  they are exceptions 


-  ,  Yet ,  as indicated by the statistics presented in Tables  and  comparing ten of the principal countries in sub-Saharan Africa ,  there are substantial differences in their economic profiles and their potential for growth and industrial development 


-  For example ,  in Zambias first open election in seventeen years ,  Frederick Chilubas movement for multiparty democracy defeated the incumbent ,  Kenneth Kaunda ,  who had been the nations leader since independence 


-  ,  Of course ,  this move to democracy does not necessarily guarantee greater stability ,  especially since political parties tend to represent particular ethnic groups ,  thereby fueling long-standing social animosities 


-  The turbulence and often violent clashes occurring during the political campaigns in Kenya ,  Togo ,  Cte dIvoire ,  and Angola reveal this instability 


-  Increasingly ,  donor nations and agencies are linking foreign aid to sustained economic reform and movement toward democratization 


-  This does not necessarily mean an immediate switch to  multiparty system but it has reduced corruption ,  improved human rights ,  encouraged more financial accountability ,  and fostered freer judiciaries and media 


-  All of these factors will create  healthier environment for foreign investment 


-  Governments are privatizing many of the government-owned enterprises ,  thereby creating interesting acquisition opportunities for foreign investors 


-  The governments are liberalizing their economies and these freer markets remove many of the costly and constraining regulations that restricted business development and fostered corruption 


-  As  result ,  Western governments and agencies are imposing tighter conditions on their economic aid and are significantly decreasing the military component of the aid they give 


-  In  time of economic recession in the industrialized nations ,  there is little political sympathy for foreign aid ,  particularly to Africa ,  which many see as  bottomless pit 


-  As an example ,  the  


-  House of Representatives recently rejected  $25 billion foreign aid authorization bill 


-  African governments are competing against each other and against the former communist countries of the East bloc for  limited supply of aid and will have to show sustained commitment to reforms if they want their aid to continue 


-  Recent indications of cooperation between South Africa and its neighbors include the establishment of South African trade missions in six of ten SADCC countries; South African officials visits to Nigeria and other African countries; coventures involving Eksom ,  South Africas electric utility ,  and the governments of Zambia and Zimbabwe in developing  regional power grid for southern Africa; and the South African Development Banks involvement in rebuilding the port of Maputo in Mozambique 


- 12 The lifting of trade sanctions on South Africa in July 1991 and the renewed availability of  


-  Eximbank credits in February 1992 should help to stimulate economic development throughout southern Africa 


- 13 ,  As part of the drive toward economic reform in many African countries ,  governments are relaxing majority local ownership and permit requirements for foreign investment ,  differential treatment of foreign and local companies ,  and restrictions on both the currency in which company capital can be held and on the repatriation of earnings 


-  For example ,  Morocco has recently enjoyed strong growth in foreign investment following passage of  law permitting majority foreign ownership 


-  ,  Many of the MNCs that have shown sustained interest in doing business in Africa have been mining and agricultural companies attracted by the continents rich natural resources 


-  Chevron and other petroleum MNCs have also had long-standing interests in oil exploration and production in Angola and West Africa 


-  Historically ,  these companies have focused on extracting the raw commodity and exporting it ,  but recently ,  some are investing in downstream processing to add value at the production site 


-  ,  Most MNCs do business in Africa simply by exporting goods made elsewhere and selling through local agents or distributors 


-  Demand is particularly strong for equipment in the mining ,  construction ,  food processing ,  textile ,  medical ,  materials handling ,  telecommunications ,  and computer industries 


-  Governments or third-party agencies sponsoring development projects ,  such as the African Development Bank ,  European Investment Bank ,  and the World Bank ,  typically request tenders 


-  The larger countries with higher per capita incomes represent the best targets for consumer product marketers 


-  ,  Larger MNCs with  long-standing record of doing business in Africa and making relatively simple products are more likely to set up subsidiaries with manufacturing plants in the larger country markets and may also license production to third parties in some smaller countries 


-  Johnson  Johnson ,  for example ,  makes consumer products in eight plants in Africa and has manufacturing licensees in two others 


-  Many European multinationals have operated in Africa since colonial times 


-  For example ,  since 1953 ,  Unilever has produced basic consumer goods in Kenya 


-  Some MNCs ship obsolete ,  lower-speed production lines from their Western plants to Africa when they set up local manufacturing 


-  The British company Booker McConnell has expanded its sugar and poultry output in Kenya through local subcontractors without taking ownership of additional land 


-  Beyond the obvious issues of market size ,  economic regulations ,  political stability ,  and sustained commitment to reforms ,  other criteria include: ,  By choice or in response to government regulation ,  many MNCs are involved in joint ventures with local businesses or governments ,  especially in the larger markets where they have manufacturing operations 


-  AIG insurance ,  for example ,  has three quite different arrangements in its principal African markets: ,   government parastatal owned 45 percent of Unilevers Kenyan subsidiary ,  East African Industries 


-  ,  The availability of private ,  nongovernment ,  joint venture partners or licensees is improving 


-  Typical is the Fakhry Group in Cte dIvoire ,   private family-owned holding company that now owns  construction firm ,   freight-forwarding business ,   supermarket chain ,  and factories making T-shirts and blue jeans 


- 15 The jeans company ,  Challenger ,  was launched when Fakhry licensed the Wrangler name in 14 West African countries and acquired Wranglers plant with its well-trained labor after the  


-  owner decided to shift from direct production to licensing 


-  Challenger manufacturing capability allows it to change its product line quickly ,  responding to the latest European fashions 


-  This has earned it  niche as  quick-delivery ,  low-cost supplier to European distributors 


-  Additionally ,  it has positioned itself in the West African market as  supplier of high-status jeans priced below the market leader ,  Levi Strauss 


-  Partly as  result ,  for example ,  the Nigerian government is investing in demonstration manufacturing projects using local raw materials; once viable ,  local investors will buy the plants as sole owners or majority partners in joint ventures 


-  ,   minority of MNCs have  long-standing tradition of marketing in Africa 


-  ,  for example ,  has had  presence since 1929 


-  In 1992 ,  it employed some  , 000 people ,  had its own operations in twenty-two African countries including plants in ten ,  sold its products in  further twenty countries ,  and generated $300 million in annual sales 


-  As  result of experience ,   persistent presence through good times and bad ,  strong financial controls ,  and good government relations ,  Colgates African operations are consistently profitable 


-  ,  How do companies like Colgate that are successfully marketing in Africa respond to the challenges and opportunities of the region? The following sections attempt to answer that question 


-  ,  Since the African continent in total represents  small market opportunity ,  most MNCs offer  selection of basic ,  versatile products ,  without local adaptation ,  from among the product lines they sell in the developed world 


-  Johnson  Johnson ,  for example ,  has found that its multipurpose petroleum jelly for moisturizing dry skin is an especially strong seller 


-  Half of AIGs business in the developed world comes from personal insurance sales ,  but in Africa ,  only 15 percent of its sales are from this source 


-  Personal life insurance policies tend to be short-term endowment policies used as savings vehicles and are marketable only in countries with moderate inflation 


-  Readers Digest adapts 20 percent of its editorial material for its African regional edition published in South Africa and substitutes African photography ,  where appropriate ,  to accompany the other 80 percent 


-  Other companies manufacture in African plants products that are especially designed to meet African consumer preferences 


-  Colgate-Palmolive ,  for example ,  makes and markets Protex antibacterial soap  in the shape of  ball rather than  bar  and Axion detergent paste only in Africa 


-  ,  Industrial marketers that do little or no manufacturing in Africa do not usually adapt their products 


-  User skill levels are such ,  however ,  that the best equipment to sell is that which is highly durable and reliable in harsh environments and ,  at the same time ,  easy to operate and easy to repair if necessary 


-  Selling equipment with bells and whistles of marginal importance to the basic functionality of the product may do more harm than good 


-  One Kenyan printing company chose to buy mechanical rather than electronic printing equipment because there was no local repair capability for the more sophisticated electronic equipment 


-  IBM ,  which sells its products in twenty-nine African countries ,  does not adapt its hardware ,  but does adapt its software 


-  IBM also operates Data Service Centers where African small businesspeople can run their own software on IBM hardware at relatively low cost 


-  ,  Because buyers are concerned about breakdowns and after-sales service ,  there is  widespread inclination to pay price premiums for well-known brands of industrial goods sold with value-added technical service and support in preference to low-price generic knock-offs from China or Hungary ,  for example 


-  This is especially so in the case of industrial equipment purchased for projects financed by international aid and development organizations 


-  Consumers in African countries ,  especially younger ,  urban residents ,  also tend to be aware of and loyal to well-known Western brands ,  even in the case of packaged goods that would be regarded as low involvement and subject to high private-label penetration in the developed world 


-  Some brand names have become so well-known that they are used as generic terms for the category; Colgate ,  for example ,  is the generic term for toothpaste for many African consumers 


-  As  result of long-standing selling efforts ,  brands from companies based in each countrys former colonial power retain dominance; for example ,  French brands of cigarettes are dominant in West Africa while British brands are strongest in East and South Africa 


-  Branded products will not automatically succeed when transferred from one African country to another due to important differences in consumer preferences 


-  ,  Some consumer goods companies offer similar pack sizes to those used in the West 


-  In the case of packaged goods companies offering multiple pack sizes ,  relative demand for each is driven by disposable income rather than household size 


-  Only the well-off minority enjoys the convenience of larger sizes; they are typically available only through urban supermarkets 


-  The smallest pack sizes are usually the best sellers ,  and in many countries ,  street hawkers break bulk further by selling ,  for example ,  individual tablets of medications or single cigarettes on street corners or through roadside stands 


-  ,  Marketers must remember that the product turnover rate ,  especially in rural outlets ,  is slow 


-  Without adding cost ,  packaging must be robust enough to protect products from heat and other poor storage conditions for long periods before they are sold to consumers 


-  There have been packaging shifts ,  particularly from tin to plastic ,  in response to cost differentials and consumer preferences 


-  ,  Storage conditions also influence the mix of products that companies can sell successfully 


-  Diet Coke is not marketed outside the tourist areas ,  not only because calorie consciousness is irrelevant to African consumers but also because the aspartame in the drink breaks down in sustained heat 


-  Margarine has  longer shelf life than butter ,  and sterilized milk packaged in Tetra-Pak containers has  multimonth shelf life 


-  ,  Most western goods are not manufactured in the African country in which they are sold but are imported from European plants or ,  in the case of some simple consumer goods and textile products ,  from other African countries 


-  Typically ,  an MNC will appoint an exclusive distributor in each market or enter into one or more distribution agreements ,  covering  subregion of several small country markets 


-  Any agreement must include  clearcut performance-based exit clause ,  along with the requirement that all shipments be paid for on an irrevocable letter-of-credit basis 


-  Hence ,  several MNCs ,  such as IBM and Nalco ,  have their own missionary salespeople and service technicians working in association with local distributors whose functions are often confined to the distribution of products 


-  The unpredictability of obtaining import licenses and delays in shipments reaching their final destinations from ports of entry often impair the delivery of customer orders 


-  However ,  better road and rail links offering more choice and ,  hence ,  lower costs are promised in southern Africa now that peace is returning to Mozambique and Angola 


-  Several Japanese auto companies maintain container ships full of cars and light trucks year-round in international waters off the East African coast; this permits  dealers order in any one country to be filled quickly and reduces the manufacturers financial risk of having valuable inventory in countries of uncertain stability 


-  ,  The main distribution challenge for consumer goods marketers is to ensure product availability in the fragmented and undercapitalized distribution systems that characterize African countries 


-  Among the objectives in Coca-Cola Companys Three  African strategy of availability ,  affordability ,  and acceptability ,  the principal challenge is the first 


-  Coca-Cola also finds expanded availability impeded by  periodic lack of capital that can prevent new bottling plants from being built 


-  Colgate-Palmolive and Johnson  Johnson both use van rancheros to carry their products to rural areas;  loudspeaker on the van announces its arrival to the locals 


-  For example ,  in West Africa ,  immigrant Lebanese and Greek traders have become increasingly important ,  and in East Africa ,  distributors of Asian descent often dominate 


-  One tobacco company achieved good distribution in Senegal by working through  team of Mauritanian distributors on sixty-day cash terms 


-  When  border dispute forced all the Mauritanians living in Senegal to flee ,  the company was able to reestablish its distribution through daily cash sales at the factory gate to Senegalese small businesses 


-  First ,  MNCs marketing locally manufactured goods may find that the benefit of lower labor costs is offset by higher costs for other raw material inputs ,  especially if they have to secure them from  government-controlled monopoly or ,  alternatively ,  import them 


-  This often means that extra inventories are needed in case they cannot obtain import licenses 


-  Second ,  distributors and business customers purchase in smaller volumes than in the West ,  so  quantity discount structure offering price breaks at lower volume levels must be developed 


-  Cargill and other multinational agricultural companies provide farmers with financing but require them to have  bank account through which monthly loan payments are remitted automatically to the lender 


-  Fourth ,  MNCs marketing less sophisticated products are likely to encounter an unexpected mix of competitors that often includes third-world multinationals for whom Africa represents  more important export market than for developed country MNCs17 ,  foreign government agencies seeking to dump excess capacity at rock-bottom prices ,  plus local entrepreneurs with low overheads as well as counterfeiters of branded products operating in the informal barter economy 


-  On the other hand ,  in many African countries ,  Citibank faces little competition even on the basic loans and letters of credit and ,  based on years of experience in selecting which risks to accept ,  makes good profits on six percent spreads between average loan and deposit rates 


-  ,  Despite  deteriorating transportation infrastructure in Africa ,  gray marketing  ( transshipment of goods purchased in  low-priced market to  high-priced one )  and smuggling are prevalent ,  particularly in the case of low bulk-to-value products such as cigarettes ,  pharmaceuticals ,  and cosmetics 


-  Economic volatility ,  high tariff barriers ,  and rapid currency swings make gray marketing both feasible and attractive to Lebanese and Asian expatriate traders 


-  The small West African country of Togo ,  for example ,  has long been  point from which distributors smuggle goods into Nigeria 


-  ,  Government price controls are less common and less broadly applied today than  decade ago; they are more likely to appear in French- than in English-speaking African countries 


-  There are fewer controls on consumer goods  ( except on the best-known ,  highly visible brands )  than on strategically important industrial goods and services such as computers ,  bank lending ,  and insurance rates 


-  Where price controls are present ,  most MNCs try to negotiate price increases to ensure that they can maintain contribution margins in case price controls are imposed or inflation grows more rapidly than expected 


-  If the company is marketing basic goods ,  the government resists authorizing price increases due to their political sensitivity 


-  Fixed prices in the face of rising production costs often puts an MNC in  negative margin situation ,  which is what Unilevers East African Industries encountered in 1992 in Kenya 


-  ,  Government regulations sometimes require artificial inflation rather than deflation of MNC prices 


-  ,  The communications mix that MNCs use in African countries is  function of three principal factors: the household penetration of various advertising media; the relative importance of trial versus repeat purchases; and the availability of and ability to execute different sales promotion techniques 


-  ,  Media penetration varies widely from country to country ,  as  function of the stage of economic development ,  literacy rates ,  urbanization ,  and level of government control 


- 18 These are the household penetration levels for three media in the adjacent countries of Uganda and Kenya: ,  ,  Some MNCs such as Coca-Cola use television advertising on  limited basis not only because of the modest household penetration but also because  high percentage of sets are black and white and ,  therefore ,  not very powerful in conveying image-building advertising 


-  Consumer goods MNCs find that radio is the most popular medium 


-  Even though they may have to produce commercials in multiple languages ,  they can develop locally tailored ads cheaply to incorporate the basic brand benefit message that most marketers need to communicate ,  thus achieving the highest household reach of any medium 


-  Another important advertising medium is the loudspeakers on the van rancheros that distribute products to rural areas and small towns 


-  Coca-Cola advertising ,  for example ,  often shows the beverage being consumed not on  free-standing basis but rather in conjunction with meals shared by large groups of family members 


-  Another campaign ,  this time by  bank in Cte dIvoire ,  claimed effectively: We offer customers the wisdom of the old world combined with the technology of the new 


-  Colgate also organizes movie trucks that visit rural towns and show open-air movies in exchange for  toothpaste carton or  soap bar wrapper 


-  ,  Business-to-business marketers use little advertising ,  even less in French- than English-speaking Africa 


-  However ,  merchandising brochures are important and should be of high quality ,  especially in the more developed African countries 


-  Business marketers typically find that personal selling coupled with demonstrations and/or trials are especially effective 


-  The vice president is usually not located in the region but rather at the MNCs European headquarters or in  European city such as Geneva or Rome with particularly good flight connections to the region and where the principal international aid organizations serving the region are also headquartered 


-  An exception is Johnson  Johnsons VP in charge of Africa and the Middle East 


-  From there ,  with the aid of fax communications ,  he can oversee twelve country managers in Africa ,  tap into the expertise of the world headquarters staff ,  and raise his regions visibility at corporate headquarters 


-  For example: ,  In Africa ,  most MNCs appoint young British ,  French ,  or American managers with an international perspective ,  an entrepreneurial spirit ,   strong finance background ,  and general management potential as country managers 


-  They usually compensate them on the basis of sales ,  profitability ,  and ,  unusually important ,  collection of receivables 


-  Except for the largest markets ,  MNC country managers in Africa are typically in their first general management positions and are responsible for  modest sales volume;  typical Colgate-Palmolive country manager in charge of Kenya ,  for example ,  would be responsible for  unit generating about $20 million in annual sales 


-  As  country manager ,  you have to instill in your customers that they owe you as an individual rather than the company 


-  The MNCs are able to attract high-quality locals because of the perceived prestige of working for such companies 


-  For example ,  African executives head East African Industries and Barclays Bank in Kenya 


-  Still others have entered government service in their home countries and become cabinet members or senior central bank officials ,  giving Citibank excellent access to top-level public policy-makers 


-  ,  Some MNCs ,  however ,  have cited difficulties in human resource development of blacks ,  particularly in South Africa 


-  ,  Whether and how to retain  marketing presence in South Africa are important dilemmas ,  but by no means the only ones confronting MNCs doing business in Africa 


-  MNCs divested their holdings in South Africa ,  but in such  way that they could still service existing customers and make new products available to the market 


-  AIG ,  for example ,  divested its South African company in 1987 but continues to provide reinsurance to the autonomous local company; AIG now acts ,  therefore ,  in the role of wholesaler rather than retailer 


-  ISM is the sole marketer of IBM products in South Africa 


- 20 ,  High-profile companies like IBM that sell  large percentage of their total volume to government agencies have to be especially sensitive to being seen as good corporate citizens 


-  IBM therefore supports many government- and development agency-sponsored projects throughout Africa ,  particularly those that help to develop small businesses and local entrepreneurship 


-  Between 1985 and 1992 ,  for example ,  IBM contributed $21 million to its South African Projects Fund ,  which supports economic development ,  legal reform ,  and education programs to benefit black South Africans 


-  Coca-Cola Company provides similar support; good government and community relations are essential to secure import licenses for concentrate and to reduce the likelihood of price controls 


-  Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive ,  meanwhile ,  work hard to develop local sources of chemicals and packaging materials of consistent quality 


-  And the MNCs play an important role in developing human resources through their company training programs 


-  For example: ,  The size of Africas economic pie is relatively small 


-  The opportunities for MNCs to increase trade with Africa and to exploit low-cost manufacturing as well as marketing opportunities are improving 


-  There are proven first-mover advantages 


-  Export ,  licensing ,  and even production opportunities exist for medium-size firms too 


-  Firms must recognize that Africas lower level of economic development creates not only  series of distinctive operating problems and challenges ,  but also significant needs and opportunities 


-  Products ,  services ,  and management techniques that have matured elsewhere can find new life in these young and untapped markets
