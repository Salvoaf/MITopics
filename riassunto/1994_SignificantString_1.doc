-  automobile manufacturers have begun to heed the wakeup call that sounded more than  decade ago when Japanese automakers cut deeply into American markets 


-  Today ,  the Big Three have begun to rebound 


-  In 1993 ,  all three companies posted gains simultaneously for the first time since 1984 


-  The turnaround stems partly from exchange rates that now favor  


-  exports ,  and partly because output from Japanese transplants is included in the  


-  ,  In this paper ,  we examine  notable case ,  New United Motor Manufacturing  ( NUMMI )  ,  in which such learning produced significant cultural change 


-  Located in Fremont ,  California ,  in the shell of  huge GM assembly plant that had closed in 1982 ,  NUMMI opened two years later 


-  Now in its tenth year of successful operation ,  it has survived the trials that cause most joint ventures to founder 


-  NUMMI demonstrates how the introduction of  new production system and  foreign culture transformed one of the worst GM plants into  world-class assembly operation in  unionized environment 


-  NUMMIs experience ,  we think ,  has implications for other organizations that are trying to learn from each other ,  especially those that work across international boundaries 


-  ,  In 1989 ,  five years after the joint venture was created ,  we formed  team of five UCLA faculty members and graduate students to work in the plant and try to understand how such  radical transformation was possible 


-  Accordingly ,  we decided to work as ethnographers using participant-observation ,   method anthropologists and other social scientists use to study people in their natural settings 


-  While participant-observation has been successful in industrial settings ,  most studies have been limited to blue-collar workers or  single researchers efforts 


-  Our study traversed the company from the assembly line to top executives to track changes over time 


-  We spread through the company to tap into day-to-day life 


-  ,  In October 1989 ,  five of us began working in different groups on the assembly line that represented  range of performance from high to low 


-  Wearing NUMMI shirts and employee badges ,  we slowly became insiders ,  learning the Toyota production system firsthand ,  while establishing relationships with team members who taught us our jobs 


-  For four months ,  we worked on both first and second shifts at various stations ranging from stamping to chassis and final assembly ,  where we stacked body parts and installed engine components ,  bumpers ,  carpets ,  mufflers ,  door panels ,  and seats 


-  During downtime and breaks ,  we talked with team members ,  team leaders ,  and group leaders and recorded notes  ( with everyones knowledge )  


-  ,  Later ,  after we were accepted on the factory floor ,  we observed managers and engineers as they worked 


-  During the initial four-month period ,  we interviewed hundreds of people ranging from team members to the president 


-  The interviews ,  coupled with more than  thousand hours of participant-observation ,  produced nearly  , 000 pages of typed fieldnotes ,  which we cross-checked with each other each week and coded into  database 


-  We met periodically with  research committee of Japanese and American managers ,  union leaders ,  and team members ,  which validated the findings and directed our work in the plant 


-  Our intent was not to evaluate good or bad practices ,  but rather to piece together  composite picture of NUMMI from multiple viewpoints 


-  We also presented our findings to the company in periodic meetings with managers and team members 


-  For the next five years ,  we maintained  lower-level but constant presence at the company to track changes as the studys scope widened 


-  What is especially interesting is that Toyota and General Motors did not intentionally set out to develop  new culture in the abstract like so many other companies do 


-  Rather than creating slogans and the image of  new culture ,  they aimed to build  new organization designed around the Toyota production system 


-  That production system ,  however ,  rested on  radically different set of assumptions than did mass production 


-  In turn ,  the new assumptions and beliefs placed different demands on  


-  production workers and union leaders ,  most of whom came from the old GM plant 


-  Likewise ,  members of the management team ,  who were hired from Ford ,  Chrysler ,  and other GM plants ,  also had to learn new ways 


-  ,  Every organization contains  set of assumptions and beliefs for guiding individuals day-to-day working behavior ,  which together compose its organizational culture 


-  Beliefs grew from scientific management ,  which rationalized the division of labor and centralized authority ,  and formed the basis for an inflexible culture ,  making large companies vulnerable to more nimble ,  decentralized competitors 


-  Assumptions that led management and labor into generations of conflict similarly put many of Americas unionized smokestack industries at  competitive disadvantage with foreign companies with more cooperative labor relations 


-  However ,  in todays unpredictable and fast-changing economy ,  they impede organizations abilities to adapt ,  often making them unproductive 


-  For example ,  findings from our larger study of NUMMI ,  USS-POSCO ,  Douglas Aircraft ,  and Hewlett Packard show how Americas industrial growth led to the formation of  pervasive set of beliefs that have proven dysfunctional in the rapidly changing world economy 


- 10 ,  Studying organizational culture is difficult because there is no commonly accepted theoretical framework to explain what it really means 


- 11 To others ,  it is  system of beliefs ,  clues to deeper issues 


- 12 Its invisible quality also renders it elusive and difficult to grasp ,  much less to change 


- 13 The beliefs and assumptions ,  however ,  truly guide day-to-day behavior 


-  It reveals the critical role NUMMIs production system played in directing and maintaining the change in behavior and beliefs once the joint venture was launched 


-  ,  The original GM plant in Fremont ,  California ,  was built in 1962 as  state-of-the-art facility 


-  However ,  angry workers called it the battleship ,  partly because of its drab greenish-tan color ,  partly because of the endless conflict that raged there for twenty years 


-  As in other strife-torn GM plants ,  Fremont had  long history of heavy-handed management and union conflict ,  which had created an us versus them attitude 


-  The only time the two sides came together was to negotiate  new contract 


-  Detailed job descriptions and wage rates ,  negotiated in an atmosphere of mistrust ,  defined human roles impersonally and contractually 


-  In 1982 ,  when GM closed the plant and laid off the workforce ,  more than  , 000 grievances remained backlogged in the system 


-  Toyota needed  foothold in the  


-  auto market ,  and its executives wanted to learn whether its production system could be successfully implemented in the United States 


-  GM wanted to add  new small car to its line and also hoped to learn Toyotas production system 


-  ,  As Toyota began to negotiate with GM ,  its representatives were skeptical about working with  militant union like the United Auto Workers  ( UAW )  


-  GM and Toyota retained Bill Usery ,   former Secretary of Labor and head of the Mediation and Conciliation Service ,  to represent their mutual interests 


- 15 Usery ,  no stranger to adversarial relationships ,  had reservations that he confided to then-UAW president Douglas Fraser: ,  Fraser acknowledged the risks of working with the Japanese but also recognized the significance of the new venture and committed the unions support 


-  ,  Wrangling broke out within the International union over whether to insist on the traditional work rules in the master contract or to give in to Toyotas demands for abolishing seniority as  base for hiring and collapsing the myriad job classifications 


-  Many UAW veterans resisted giving up seniority and job classifications ,  which represented the accomplishments of  lifetime of struggle 


-  Bruce Lee ,  the UAWs western regional director ,  and others in the UAW argued that retaining these protections would only slow the recovery of the  


-  Lee commented: ,  With support from outgoing UAW president Fraser ,  incoming president Owen Bieber ,  and Don Ephlin ,  head of the UAWs GM department ,  the union was able to give Toyota the assurances it needed 


-  Its executives agreed that the joint venture would rehire the majority of its workforce from the pool of laid-off GM workers ,  and that it would recognize the UAW as the bargaining agent for the workforce 


-  The UAW in turn agreed to accept the Toyota production system ,  to increase greatly the flexibility of work rules ,  and to simplify the job classifications 


-  Part of the agreement letter indicates the tone of the new relationship: Both parties are undertaking this new proposed relationship with the full intention of fostering an innovative labor relations structure ,  minimizing the traditional adversarial roles ,  and emphasizing mutual trust and good faith 


-  ,  In 1985 ,  its first year of operation ,  NUMMI assembled 64 , 766 Novas   car that has been hailed by leading consumer magazines as one of the highest-quality small cars 


- 16 Workers daily attendance averaged 98 percent in 1985 ,  and only  handful of grievances were filed 


-  NUMMI was cited in union magazines as having changed into  worksite unlike any other in the UAWs experiences 


-  Newsweek called NUMMI a model of industrial tranquility ,  while the Wall Street Journal reported that NUMMI has managed to convert  crew of largely middle-aged ,  rabble-rousing former GM workers into  crack force that is beating the bumpers off Big Three plants in efficiency and product quality 


- 17 ,  Tatsuro Toyoda ,  son of Toyotas founder ,  headed NUMMIs management team 


-  Kan Higashi ,  also  Toyota executive ,  became executive vice president; Dennis Cuneo ,  whom Higashi hired from  Washington firm that assisted Toyota in the joint venture negotiations ,  became head of NUMMIs legal affairs 


-  Cuneo joined NUMMI partly because he was convinced that it represented  watershed case in American antitrust law: ,  Gary Convis left  ten-year career with Ford in Cleveland ,  Ohio ,  to head manufacturing 


-  Bill Childs was hired from General Dynamics to establish NUMMIs human resources and labor relations departments 


-  Though regarded as  hard-liner by many in the plant ,  Childs saw NUMMI as an opportunity to alter the prevailing model of antagonistic labor-management relations 


-  ,  After ten years ,  NUMMI continues to improve 


-  Today ,  the plant represents  $1 


-  The number of workers has grown from  , 200 to more than  , 300 and is projected to increase in 1995 


-  ,  NUMMI produces the same number of cars as GM did in the same plant ,  but with much higher quality and half the workforce 


- 18 ,  At NUMMIs tenth anniversary ,  General Motors president Jack Smith ,  head of the GM side of the negotiations ,  commented ,  Ten years ago  lot of people thought NUMMI would never get off the ground 


-  But today ,  with the quality and efficiency that NUMMI has achieved ,  it is the mecca of the auto industry in North America 


-  Tatsuro Toyoda ,  president of Toyota ,  remarked ,  I have  special place in my heart for this company 


-  NUMMIs success proves that labor and management can work toward mutually beneficial goals that serve the best interests of everybody 


-  ,  There have been  variety of explanations for NUMMIs achievements ,  none based on first-hand research in the plant 


-  Even people inside NUMMI were unsure about the reasons for its success 


-  Some think NUMMIs success resulted from workers being unemployed for two years and willing to accept almost anything to regain their high-paying jobs 


-  Others attribute its achievements to the careful job-application screening process 


-  ,  Our evidence suggests that if GM had set out to recreate the plant from its old workforce ,  it would have failed ,  because old beliefs were too deeply etched into the psyches of managers and workers to accommodate the necessary radical change 


-  Gary Convis explained how working with the Japanese was  powerful form of training: ,  GMs seasoned ,  experienced workforce provided  hospitable environment for the Japanese contributions 


-  Most of the people we interviewed said they would not go back to work for GM ,  even if it reopened across the street 


-  Most NUMMI employees take pride in the quality of the cars they build under the new system 


-  In  recent survey ,  93 percent said they were proud of their work 


-  The joint venture inherited  work-force of people who had known each other for many years 


-  Friendships cut across lines that might divide others ,  creating an open atmosphere 


-  Their tolerance helps unite the multicultural ,  multiethnic workforce ,  often bridging serious conflict 


-  Employees speak proudly of the plants diverse workforce ,  commenting that differences between people are  source of strength 


-  Jesse Palomino ,   former UAW committeeman explained ,  This place is  blend 


-  Sherry Ward ,   seasoned GM autoworker ,  commented on how she felt when  Fortune article reported that NUMMIs workers came from the barrio and the ghetto:20 ,  As the company worked to fuse the Japanese and American beliefs into  single unit ,  it discovered four principles without which little progress could have been made 


-  ,  The management team knew from the beginning that unless it overcame the old adversarial management-labor relationship ,  the new venture would founder 


-  Workers were skeptical about Bruce Lees decision to appoint the old GM bargaining committee as the new ventures bargaining agent because of its leaderships reputation for militancy; these twenty-five individuals were now expected to guide the union into  new era of cooperative labor-management relationships 


-  However ,  by being included in decision making from the outset ,  they could test managements commitment to teamwork ,  trust ,  and respect 


-  Because the committee members were also influential in establishing the mutual vision between management and labor ,  they recognized that their futures were intertwined ,   first step in creating  model of cooperative labor relations 


-  But he also knew these people were important allies: ,  As an elected union official ,  Lee had  great deal at stake 


-  If the union cooperated and gave away some of its traditional job protections to provide the flexibility Toyota demanded ,  and if the workers found the conditions intolerable ,  Lee would quickly become the target of union opposition 


-  If you come back and say ,  Bruce ,  this just doesnt work ,  then Ill say ,  Fine! Well try something else 


-  ,  At the startup in early 1984 ,  union leaders and newly hired managers together stuffed envelopes with job applications 


-  Five thousand former GM workers received applications with  letter explaining how new employees would be expected to contribute to an atmosphere of trust and cooperation and that poor quality workmanship and absenteeism would not be tolerated 


-  In the end ,  85 percent of the newly hired men and women had worked in the old GM plant 


-  According to Bill Childs ,  only 300 applicants were rejected outright  because of unusually poor work histories or drug or alcohol problems 


-  ,  Many of the UAW locals leaders had difficulty setting aside old antagonisms to work with the company 


-  However ,  both DeJesus and Nano knew that the joint venture offered  chance for their members to go back to work 


-  Nano described conditions at GM ,  where he headed the bargaining committee 


-  But we forgot that theres got to be smoke coming out of the stack or theres nothing to fight about 


-  ,  Toyota sent 400 trainers from Japan to work with American counterparts to teach the production system that would become the leverage for cultural change 


-  At the same time ,  NUMMI invested more than $3 million to send 600 of its new employees to Toyota for training 


-  At Toyota ,  Tony DeJesus learned the system ,  while getting to know the Japanese 


-  At first ,  they communicated in sign language: ,  The bonds of friendship and mutual understanding became more important as Americans and Japanese felt the stresses and strains of starting the new company 


-  The policy also stipulates that before anyone is laid off ,  all outside contract work will be dropped and executives will take substantial pay cuts 


-  At first ,  workers distrusted the policy because it was so unusual ,  but it has now been tested at least four times  and each trial has made the company more credible 


-  auto companies would have laid off the second shift ,  but NUMMIs management stood behind its policy and fired no one 


-  Team members not needed on the line were retrained in the basics of the new production system ,  teamwork ,  and problem solving 


-   recent company survey showed that 80 percent of the team members agreed that job security was the most important aspect of working at NUMMI 


-  The policy also fostered the workers belief that they are valued as assets rather than as costs to be trimmed during downturns and reinforces managers respect for their employees 


-  Gary Convis remarked: ,  Convis explained that when something goes wrong on the line ,  most  


-  managers look for  culprit someone who is slacking off or doing something wrong 


-  In contrast ,  Convis said: ,  Kan Higashi explained that ,  from the beginning ,  Toyota understood the need to establish the concept of fairness 


-  He wanted  general leveling  fewer levels of management ,  no executive perks ,  and  blurring of lines between Japanese and Americans ,  managers and team members 


-  Higashi admitted that ,  after  fifteen-hour day ,  he wanted nothing more than to fraternize with his Japanese colleagues ,  but he resisted: ,  As Toyotas production system was introduced ,  the management team and the union compressed job classifications and created  flat wage structure that equalized work and rewards while fostering fairness 


-  GMs former eighty job classifications were collapsed into only three one production class and two higher-paid skilled trades classes  each of which falls into the same $19 to $21 hourly wage rate 


-  More recently ,  NUMMI instituted  bonus system ,  based on gainsharing ,  that benefits all employees equally 


-  ,  NUMMIs flat wage structure also reinforced the feeling that the companys fortunes depended on everyones efforts 


-  Many American managers believe that employees are motivated to work hard only by incremental pay increases ,  not by flat wage rates 


-  To the contrary ,  Convis explained: ,  As Toyotas production system has diffused to NUMMI ,  some adaptations have been made ,  but its key features have endured 


-  One is that each employee must be responsible for product quality   significant departure from tradition at GM 


-  By standardizing work and by removing excess inventory through just-in-time delivery ,  Toyotas pull system creates  tight link with the customer 


- 21 It demands that individuals work together interdependently and cooperatively for the common good 


-  ,  The system runs at  preset speed known as takt time  ( the German word for meter or musical rhythm )  that determines the length of time  team member has to perform his or her task ,  currently set at sixty seconds 


-  Because the time standard is observed throughout the plant ,  it levels the work  known as heijunka  while keeping the line under continuous tension 


-  ,  By running the system with few buffers and using human motion sparingly ,  problems can be traced to their root causes through kaizen ,  or continuous improvement 


-  Toyotas jidoka principle ,  that jobs are to be done correctly the first time ,  minimizes the chance that defects will be passed down the line 


-  However ,  workers are obligated to stop the line when they see  problem by pulling the overhead andon cord 


-  Empowering workers to stop the line was  radical change from the old GM plant 


-  The superintendent would have your ass 


-  One manager remarked ,  When theres no downtime ,   know that my people are sending junk through ,  or theyre trying to be super-stars 


-  His comment reflects NUMMIs philosophy that each group should generate  few minutes of downtime each day because each imperfection represents an opportunity for improvement 


-  ,  Another element that reinforces interdependence is making performance data available 


-  Standardized work and kaizen charts hang in the team areas ,  along with attendance boards and defect records 


-  But if youre up there more than once for the same defect ,  watch out! ,  Managing  system like NUMMIs is difficult because it is dynamic and requires constant adjustment to change 


-  When NUMMI reaches its goals ,  team members and managers naturally tend to become complacent ,  which causes quality to suffer 


-  Some veteran auto-workers interpret these cycles as  return to old GM days ,  which generates fear and uncertainty 


-  On  cycles downside ,  defects increase ,  causing management to exert corrective pressure that stresses the entire organization 


-  ,  Osamu Kimura ,  NUMMIs third president ,  described  constant need to renew the spirit by finding problem areas and accelerating improvements 


-  For instance ,  in 1991 ,  when complacency had set in and quality began to suffer ,  Kimura launched the J-1 program: We made it  campaign with buttons and banners ,  so that employees could see our commitment each day 


- -built compacts and number one for compact trucks 


-  ,  However ,  when the pressure gets too great ,  managers sometimes fall back on old ways 


-  He learned to trust that productivity would follow quality by following the systems principles 


-  Mulleague commented that it was difficult at first to grasp what Higashi meant when he said ,  I dont care if you build only six cars  day ,  as long as they meet our quality standard 


-  Mulleague remarked: When the pressures on ,  half of the people in this place will revert to their old ways  pushing cars out the door ,  and Im no exception 


-  ,  Discipline is critical to NUMMIs system 


-  When managers fail to follow the systems principles ,  order breaks down ,  quality suffers ,  and relationships become strained 


-  However ,  when management consistently observes the systems principles ,  quality and productivity achieve  natural balance 


-  For example ,  in trial runs in 1993 ,  team members found that some new parts were difficult to install on the new models 


-  Convis described how the problem held up production for weeks ,  inceasing pressure as the schedule slipped: ,  Team members and managers traced the problems to the parts suppliers ,  where they were remedied 


-  It develops from working together productively under stress 


-  For example ,  pressure from management caused an experienced group leader ,  Roger Gallet ,  to eliminate  job on the line without first consulting his group 


-  During the morning break ,  Gallet informed his team members ,  with whom he had worked for  number of years ,  that he had already made the change 


-  Pandemonium followed ,  as one team member shouted angrily ,  You know ,  weve got  stake in this place too! Why werent we consulted? Arent we important? Another team member blurted ,  Managements got to learn to play by the rules 


-   dont want to see this place fold ,  but this is sure as hell no way to run  plant 


-  As music signaled the end of the break ,  the meeting broke up without resolution 


-  Hes got to know how we feel 


-  ,  At the end of the shift ,  Gallet called an impromptu meeting and explained ,  I was under pressure this morning ,  and  didnt want to hear what you had to say 


-  After the meeting some of the team members tried to soften the mornings harshness by tapping Gallet on the arm ,  making friendly comments as they went to their lockers 


-  It became apparent how the trust that had developed between Gallet and his group over the years played an important role by absorbing conflict and redirecting energy 


-  For instance ,  management announced  policy that groups should rotate jobs every two-and-a-half hours to reduce injuries ,  level the work ,  and break boredom 


-  Anger spread as one woman shouted ,  Why not find out what the majority wants? Let me tell you ,  sir ,  youre gone  good deal of the time ,  and you dont know what goes on here 


-  Facing the group ,  he said ,  There are some things you vote on and some things you dont 


-  There is  time to get input ,  but  dont have to take  vote on it or get your blessing 


-  His manager and  member of the human resources department counseled the group leader in more effective ways to foster participation and handle conflict 


-  His performance has improved ,  and he still works at the plant 


-  ,   large element of building trust lies in NUMMIs participative style of management 


-  NUMMI does not have  democratic system in which workers and managers vote on issues ,  but rather open decision making ,  which enourages individuals to contribute 


-  Convis explained its importance: ,  Every voice in  decision has value and must be heard; managements job is to honor opposing forces ,  draw them together ,  and reconcile them in the decision-making process 


-  ,  NUMMI has now survived for nearly  decade 


-  Secure workers are more productive ,  and as  companys productivity increases ,  its market share expands 


-  Toyota invested another $340 million in the plant and expanded the workforce by about 900 employees 


-  Team members witnessed how this principle translated into opportunity ,  as the plant grew and new jobs were created 


-  Japanese coordinators taught their American counterparts how to extend decision making to workers 


-  They gained the respect of most NUMMI employees because of their detailed job knowledge and willingness to ignore status differences and work on solving problems 


-  ,  Tony Fisher ,  who worked for GM and now heads NUMMIs environmental affairs ,  described the power of consensual decision making ,  The Japanese ask questions and seem to talk endlessly about solutions 


-  It may take  long time to make  decision ,  but once its made ,  thats it 


-  Pity the person who tries to undermine the decision once its made 


-  Fisher recounted his introduction to Toyotas beliefs ,  which he found could be easily integrated with his own: I always believed in including people in important decisions 


-  The Japanese are non-Christian and look what they do! ,  Finally ,  though some team members complain about the systems demands for discipline ,  most agree that ,  under GM ,  discipline had become too lax 


-  Team members and managers respect the self-discipline the Japanese bring to their work 


-  One manager marveled at how the Japanese analyze  problem: Theyll sit there and spend hours on it ,  asking hundreds of whys until its solved 


-   team member on the final assembly line explained that he likes the Japanese discipline because it fosters orderliness and pride in the company 


-  He characterized NUMMI as  family in which the parents have to insist on what they want: When GM ran this place ,  it looked like  dump  chicken bones in the cars ,  broken glass in the parking lot 


-  The parking lots clean ,  just like the rest of the place 


-  Hayao Kawai ,   Jungian analyst and professor of education and Japanese studies at Kyoto University ,  explained the basis of the Japanese communal spirit: ,  Kawai described how Japans ancient animistic religions conceived of the center ,  where Christians place God ,  as nothing 


-  This principle extends to the inclusive concept of lifetime employment 


-  ,  The Japanese concept of self as part of  larger community reveals itself in numerous ways at NUMMI 


-   Toyota senior coordinator explained how he first noticed the difference between Americans and Japanese in sports competition: ,  Interestingly ,  the clash over communitarian and individualistic values occurs in the areas on which Japanese and Americans most easily agree  employment security ,  participative decision making ,  and plant discipline 


-  Over time ,  interest in the exercises died ,  though the music still played 


-  One team member ,  who appreciates the Japanese influence ,  nevertheless quit the exercises: They just went too far 


-  The children know that if they work for Toyota ,  theyll be taken care of 


-  We dont have anything like that here 


-  Thats why the Toyota model in its pure form wouldnt work here at NUMMI 


-   young Toyota coordinator expressed concern with the distance between American workers and their employers: Japanese workers make  lifetime commitment to their employers ,  but Americans lack this sense of belonging 


-  We work to live ,  not live to work 


-   dont think the American worker will ever be like the Japanese 


-   just dont think that model would ever work here 


-  ,  Sometimes tension surfaces ,  as Toyota coordinators press the fine points of the system and unknowingly transgress this imaginary line 


-  For example ,  after the first shift ,   senior Toyota coordinator was training  group of managers in standardized work 


-  According to the standardized work part sheet ,  six trays should have been on the left ,  and two on the right 


-  workers fear losing their individualism 


-  One night at  party after work ,   group from chassis discussed  team member ,  Ramon ,  who had left early after angrily denouncing the company and the team concept 


-  Ramon was known as  complainer ,  doing as little work as possible and counting the days until retirement 


-  This is most evident in how Toyota introduced the production system to the American workforce 


-   senior Toyota coordinator reinforced Higashis view ,  saying that ,  at Toyota ,  he simply explained how to do something ,  and team leaders followed without question: But ,  at NUMMI ,   didnt get the same reaction 


-  He had to compromise because he could not force his way on the American workers: The new way had to be localized 


-  Otherwise ,  team members simply refuse to participate 


-  It took  year for me to discover  way to get the Americans to agree with me 


-  Only after they reached mutual agreement ,  would NUMMI employees share their ideas and make suggestions on how to improve the system 


-  ,  Osamu Kimura noted that the cultural exchange has worked both ways: Despite our differences as Japanese and Americans ,  we found that we share many important similarities 


-  Kimura has  personal style that managers and team members appreciate 


-  He worries ,  however ,  that language obscures the fine points of communication so critical to building relationships: ,  Another Toyota coordinator explained how personal relationships with his  


-  He described GM and Toyota like oil and water and NUMMI like  small salad bowl: ,  NUMMI has so far weathered pressures that have caused others to founder ,  and its culture continues to evolve 


-  Since the late 1980s ,  Toyota has gradually recalled its management and technical team ,  which today includes Iwao Itoh  ( NUMMIs fourth president )  and about twenty-five managers and coordinators 


-  However ,  Toyota began to scale back its presence at NUMMI only after being assured that its key principles had been successfully diffused ,  and that the American management team had learned to manage the dynamic system 


-  Itoh ,  like his predecessors ,  is fully conscious of the continuous reinforcement needed to keep the system from slipping into  comfortable zone of complacency: My greatest challenge is to make sure that both managers and team members truly internalize the concepts 


-  management team remains nearly intact 


-  Internal quality audits done by Toyota ,  GM ,  and NUMMI over the last few years were validated in May 1994 ,  when NUMMIs Geo Prizm won the highest score ever for an American-built vehicle 


-  The Federal Trade Commission noted NUMMIs importance when ,  in late 1993 ,  it set aside its original order limiting the joint venture to twelve years 


-  The commission explained that it made the decision because of evidence that NUMMI was helping General Motors reap the benefits of gaining first-hand experience with an efficient production system 


- 25 For instance ,  union leaders and team members had to suspend hard-learned beliefs that management would take advantage of them in order to learn Toyotas principles 


-  When individuals learned that they would share fairly in the fruits of the companys success ,  they began to embrace the systems principles and let go of old ,  dysfunctional beliefs 


-  The impetus came partly from the shutdown and resulting unemployment ,  but more so from two added factors: NUMMIs commitment to treating its workforce fairly ,  and Toyotas integrated production system that demanded participation ,  mutual respect ,  and trust 


-  ,  Second ,  Toyota assumed dominance in the joint venture and took full responsibility for teaching the Americans how to implement and manage its production system 


-  The Japanese partners beliefs and management style were more in tune with market demands for quality and speed ,  as well as with employees needs for cooperation ,  trust ,  and respect 


-  Agreeing on who was responsible for day-to-day management at the outset enabled Toyota to administer consistent direction from the top ,  which sent  message of consistency and stability to the rest of the company 


- 26 ,  Third ,  Toyota managers resisted temptations to forge ahead with  pure version of the system 


-  By tolerating ambiguity and by searching for consensus ,  Toyota managers established the beginnings of mutual respect and trust with the American workers and managers 


- 27 Mazdas assembly plant was not  joint venture ,  although it had some characteristics similar to NUMMI in its agreement to hire an all-union workforce 


-  However ,  Mazda failed to lay sufficient groundwork and establish  mutual cultural understanding with the  


-  workers 


-  The UAW local confronted Mazdas management and resisted the introduction of its production system 


-  Grievances mounted and Mazda tried to exert control by ordering workers not to speak publicly in hopes of avoiding negative publicity 


-  Cooperation and teamwork broke down as the UAWs New Directions ,   wing of the union that opposes cooperation with management ,  won control 


-  Thus ,  despite Mazdas hopes for  cooperative ,  profitable venture with its unionized American work-force ,  the companys failure to examine both its own and the UAWs beliefs and assumptions led to  morass of conflict that could have been avoided 


-  Toyota has successfully diffused its principles ,  and the company has enjoyed nearly  decade of continuous expansion 


-  It has thus demonstrated to its workforce that ,  by converting waste to value-adding activity through continuous improvement ,  market share and resulting employment will grow 


-  manufacturers have begun to adopt some of the principles introduced by Toyota at NUMMI ,  it is still unknown just how far or in what form these lessons have permeated 


- 28 As other manufacturers embrace Toyotas principles ,  it is also unclear how the system will endure if economic conditions change ,  demanding cutbacks and layoffs 


-  Also unclear is what new manufacturing and management paradigms will emerge and how lean systems like NUMMIs will adapt
