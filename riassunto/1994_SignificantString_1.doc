-  Cross-cultural negotiation need not be as frustrating nor as costly as it is often made out to be; it can be  productive and satisfying experience 


-  There are eight culturally responsive strategies for  manager to consider  ( see Figure  )  


-  These guidelines reflect four basic ,  ongoing considerations for  strategy: its feasibility for the manager ,  its fit with the counterparts likely approach and therefore its capacity to lead to coherent interaction ,  its appropriateness to the relationship and circumstances at hand ,  and its acceptability in light of the managers values 


-  )  Different types of relationships with counterparts and even different phases of  relationship with  particular counterpart call for different strategies 


-  ,  For the cross-cultural negotiator ,  the very presence of more than one culture complicates the process of understanding the relationship and knowing the counterpart 


-  In contrast to the within-culture negotiator ,  the cross-cultural negotiator cannot take common knowledge and practices for granted and thereby simply concentrate on the individual 


-  It becomes important to actively consider the counterpart in two respects: as  member of  group and as an individual 


-  ,  The right balance in these considerations is not easily struck 


-  The cross-cultural negotiator should thus consider both the counterparts cultural background and individual attributes ,  perhaps weighting them differently according to the culture involved ,  but mindful always that every negotiation involves developing  relationship with  particular individual or team 


-  Were not used to analytic thinking in your Western way 


-  ,  One way to deal with this inescapable cultural bias is to acknowledge it and remain aware of the continual challenges of effectively choosing and implementing  strategy 


-  We usually have no impetus to consider the culture of the group because we repeatedly engage in activities with each other without incident or question 


-  For insights about American culture more broadly ,  consider both Americans self-examinations and outsiders observations 


-  ,  the basic concept is distributive bargaining ,  the most significant issues are substantive ones ,  negotiators are chosen for their knowledge ,  individual aspirations predominate over community needs ,  and so forth )  


-  For instance ,  distributive bargaining implies certain attitudes toward conflict and its handling  ( direct )  ,  toward business relationships  ( competitive )  ,  and toward the purpose of negotiation  ( to maximize individual gains )  


-  Simply ask yourself ,  What do  usually do at times like this? Why? What do  gain from doing it this way? ,  These kinds of questions resemble those used in basic negotiation training to distinguish an underlying interest from  bargaining position ,  namely ,  What does this bargaining position do for me? Why? ,  Developing cultural and personal profiles is an ongoing task 


-  Instead of writing them up once and moving on ,  return to them and refine them as you gain experience and understanding 


-  The value of such  process is considerable 


-  It increases your self-awareness; it helps you explain your expectations and behavior to  counterpart; it prepares you to make decisions under pressure; it allows you to compare your culture to another on  holistic rather than fragmented basis; it helps you determine  counterparts level of familiarity with your culture; its products  profiles  can be used in future negotiations with other cultural groups; it motivates interest in other cultures; and it enables you to act consistently and conscientiously 


-  Ideally ,  this process involves learning in the active sense: developing the ability to use the counterparts cultural and personal negotiation scripts ,  as well as knowing the scripts and related values 


-  Even  negotiator with low familiarity who is likely to employ an agent needs some information in order to interact effectively with the agent and to assess the agents performance 


-  Try especially to glean and appreciate the basic concept of negotiation because it anchors and connects the other dimensions 


-  Without it ,   negotiator ,  as an outsider ,  cannot comprehend  counterparts actions; they appear bizarre or whimsical 


-  Moreover ,  if you focus merely on tactics or simple do and dont-type tips and reach  point in  transaction for which you have no tip ,  you have no base  no sense of the spirit of the interaction  to guide you through this juncture 


- 15 In addition to general nonfiction works on French culture ,  novels and films can convey an extraordinary sense of interactions among individuals and groups 


-  ,  Here ,  as in reflections on your own culture ,  make sure to consider core beliefs and values of the culture 


- 18 ,  Whether or not you have prior experience working with  particular counterpart or other inside information ,  try to explore the counterparts own negotiation concepts ,  practices ,  and values 


-  ,  This entire undertaking poses challenges for every negotiator ,  regardless of the strategy ultimately chosen 


-  So  negotiator should not count on the same strategy to work equally well with every counterpart from  given cultural group  ( even if the counterparts have the same level of familiarity with the negotiators culture )  or ,  for that matter ,  with the same counterpart all the time 


-  ,  To continue your preparations for  negotiation ,  consider particular facets of your relationship with the counterpart and the circumstances 


- 21 But the following considerations  ( four for relationships ,  four for circumstances )  seem significant 


- 22 In sum ,  the negotiator should acknowledge any already established form of interaction ,  assess its attributes  (  


-  ,  coherence )  and the parties expectations of the future ,  and decide whether to continue ,  modify ,  or break from the established form 


- 23 Noting similarities as well as differences will enable you to identify those aspects of your usual behavior that do not need to change  ( similarities )  and those aspects that do  ( major differences )  if you choose  strategy that involves elements of both your negotiation script and the counterparts  (  


-  Some people overemphasize differences 


-  Others ,  focusing on superficial features ,  overestimate similarities and their understanding of another culture  (  


-  ,  Of course ,   negotiator highly familiar with the counterparts culture who plans to adopt an embrace strategy ,  operating wholly within that culture ,  has less need for these comparisons 


- 25 Furthermore ,  it makes little sense to rely on power and disregard  counterparts familiarity with ones culture when ones goal is coherent interaction 


-  In  sense ,  gender groups have their own cultures ,  and mixed interaction within  national culture is already cross-cultural 


-  She says to herself ,  What is the matter?28 Thus ,  although current information about negotiating scripts for other countries tends to be based on male-male interactions ,  complete culturally-based negotiator profiles should include gender-based scripts 


-  ,  With regard to circumstances ,  the second part of step  ,  there are at least four relevant considerations 


-  ,  Do you have  or can you create  an opportunity beforehand to coordinate strategy with your counterpart? If so ,  consider the joint strategies 


-  Embracing the counterparts script makes little sense if the counterpart is embracing your script 


-  Further ,  reliable prediction and successful influence narrow the scope of  negotiators deliberations and reduce uncertainty 


-  While these concerns relate to the parties relationship  ( step  )  ,  they have  direct impact on interaction that merits  separate step 


-  ,  Without direct and reliable information ,  you are left to predict the counterparts strategy choice on the basis of his or her traits and motivations 


-  For example ,  the internally focused individual from  culture with high communication complexity  ( reliance on nonverbal and other contextual cues for meaning )  ,  which often correlates with low risk-taking propensity ,  would be more likely to involve  mediator than to coordinate adjustment  ( which is too explicit )  or to embrace or improvise  ( which are too uncertain )  


- 31 ,  Whether or not you can predict  counterparts strategy choice ,  why not try to influence it? If you predict  strategy favorable to you ,  perhaps you can reinforce it; if unfavorable ,  change it; and if predicted without certainty ,  ensure it 


-  ,  In this line of thinking ,   conflict could bring out the parties differences so dramatically as to provide valuable lessons and working material for both the negotiator and counterpart 


-  )  ,  With respect to means of influence ,  Americans sometimes preemptively take action ,  such as using English in conversation without inquiring about  non-American counterparts wishes or capabilities ,  but there are other ,  often more mutually satisfactory ,  ways to influence  counterpart 


-  They range from direct means ,  such as explicitly requesting  counterpart to choose  particular strategy ,  to tacit means ,  such as disclosing ones level of familiarity with the counterparts culture ,  revealing ones own strategy choice ,  or designating  meeting site likely to elicit certain types of conduct 


-  As you evaluate these options ,  bear in mind that their effectiveness will probably differ according to the counterparts culture and personal attraction to you 


-  So if the four criteria above do not direct you to only one right strategy ,  consider ,  at the end ,  which of the remaining strategies you would be most comfortable implementing 


-  Feasibility and coherence considerations may narrow your choices down to one unilateral strategy ,  yet you should still check that choice for its appropriateness ,  given the relationship and circumstances ,  and its consonance with core beliefs and values 


-  And when  negotiator wishes to consider joint strategies ,  relationship factors and circumstances are essential to consult 


-  In sum ,  the support of all four criteria for  particular strategy choice should give you confidence in it 


- 34 ,  As an example of strategy selection based on all four criteria ,  consider an American ,  Smith ,  who is preparing for  confidential ,  one-on-one meeting with  French-man he has never met before ,  Dupont 


-  ,   complicated situation will require more complex considerations 


-  )  But the five steps above  reflect ,  learn ,  consider ,  predict ,  and choose  constitute  sound and useful guide for strategy selection 


-  Simply adhering to ones own plan of action is difficult  and may become undesirable 


- 37 The counterpart wants to understand you and to be understood; that is what occurs in coherent interaction 


-  If you have accurately assessed the counterparts level of familiarity with your culture and ability to use  particular script ,  and if the counterpart recognizes the strategy you are using ,  you stand  better chance of achieving coherence 


-  ,  Should you make the first strategic move or wait until the counterpart does? This decision affects the transition from preliminary warm-up discussions to negotiation of business matters 


-  It depends ,  in part ,  on whether you need to gather more information about the counterparts strategic intentions and abilities 


-  This would matter when both parties have at least moderate familiarity with each others cultures and have more than one unilateral strategy they can realistically choose ,  and when you have chosen  strategy  (  


-  The decision over timing also depends on whether you need to make the strategy you have chosen distinguishable from another one  (  


-  )  In sum ,  to decide on timing ,  you should weigh the benefits of additional information against the costs of losing an opportunity to take leadership and set the tone of the interaction ,   loss that includes being limited in your strategy options by the counterparts strategy choice 


-  Once parties have decided to use  joint strategy ,  first moves consist of fleshing out particulars 


-  ,  Parties coordinating adjustment might consider trading off their respective priorities among the twelve cultural aspects in the negotiator profiles 


-  This pragmatic approach will probably appeal more to Western counterparts than to Asian ones ,  however ,  particularly if the Asian counterparts have only low or moderate cultural familiarity 


-  ,   counterparts reactions to your ideas and conduct provide critical information about the counterpart personally and about the effectiveness of your chosen strategy with this particular individual 


-  As you use that information to make continual adjustments and to evaluate your strategy ,  you may want to return to the four criteria of feasibility ,  coherence ,  appropriateness ,  and acceptability 


-  Negotiator profiles include some cues and imply others under dimensions such as communication complexity and nature of persuasion 


-  ,  On other occasions ,  one may have to explain modifications ,  shifts ,  and changes before they are made in order to minimize the odds of being perceived as unpredictable or deliberately disruptive 


-  ,  Developing  relationship with  particular counterpart requires an attentiveness to its life and rhythms 


-  In this way ,  you can expand the number of feasible strategies ,  giving both you and the counterpart more flexibility in the ways you relate to each other 


-  The more we explore the variety of parties capabilities and circumstances and the more we question the feasibility ,  coherence ,  appropriateness ,  and acceptability of doing as Romans do ,  the more apparent the need becomes for additional culturally responsive strategies 


-  That includes high familiarity with  Roman culture  knowing the cognitive and behavioral elements of  Roman negotiating script and being able to use the script competently 


-  The negotiator at the high familiarity level enjoys the broadest possible strategic flexibility for negotiations with Romans and the highest probability that ,  for  particular negotiation ,  one strategy will solidly meet all four selection criteria 


-  Even though  negotiator may need to focus only on the one culture that  counterpart deems predominant at any one point in time ,  there are several to explore and manage across time ,  occasions ,  and people 


-  If negotiators with  moderate amount of cross-cultural experience have the most to gain from these tools ,  first-time negotiators have before them  better sense of what lies ahead ,  and highly experienced negotiators can find some explanation for the previously unexplained and gain deeper understanding 


-  In addition ,  the culture-individual considerations and ongoing challenges highlighted throughout the article will serve all cross-cultural negotiators 


-  Perhaps we can all travel these paths more knowingly ,  exploring and building them as we go
