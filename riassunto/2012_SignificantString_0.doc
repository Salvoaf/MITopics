-  Moving up the hierarchy into new roles or environments ,  executives may find they need to play up or rein in different facets of their personality 


-  Starting with  master list of nearly 18 , 000 personality descriptors ,  the list was eventually boiled down to five fundamental factors: need for stability ,  extraversion ,  openness ,  agreeableness and conscientiousness 


-  They may have difficulty understanding why others are worried 


-  Alongside three hopeful reasons for why something will work out ,  an executive prone to overoptimism should come up with three gloomy reasons why it may not 


-  Robert Iger ,  CEO of Walt Disney ,  has acknowledged in an article in the New York Times that this is an area hes worked on: Ive learned ,  in general ,  to be more patient 


-  ,  Certain executives we coach are less resilient to stress and struggle to stay calm ,  reflecting  high need for stability 


-  To avoid overreacting ,  executives need to find ways of emptying their anger container before it reaches the brim 


-  The simplest method is to verbalize those negative emotions: I feel disappointed/frustrated/upset/irritated because   


-  Research in brain imaging suggests that putting our feelings into words dampens those feelings 


-  It expels negative energy while providing others with  better understanding of how the executive ticks 


-  ,  Extraversion reflects our desire to be with other people and to draw energy from them 


-  Discussing his proposed action plan ,  he conceded: Ive realized that  have  habit of taking over in meetings 


-   want to get better at listening and to give less assertive people more space to express their opinions 


-  So  need to listen more ,  but  also need to show  have processed what theyve said 


-  Then ask: Do you want me to carry on? ,  Another facet of extraversion is higher activity levels 


-  Fast-paced people need to recognize others needs and adapt their energy levels accordingly 


-  ,  In particular ,  leaders with high energy levels need to be aware that this disposition can create tension with slower-paced people ,  especially those whom the leaders regard as slow-minded or uncommitted 


-  But then we were mandated to work on the same cross-functional team and  realized that beneath that leisurely exterior was  very sharp mind 


-  Executives who are more internally focused often need to learn to behave like extraverts  to adopt behaviors that are more communicative ,  to give presentations and to socialize 


-  And this mug is  reminder: What is your expression right now? The idea is not to smile if you dont feel like it  just to remember to relax your facial muscles 


-  But Sharer has realized that when  CEO often discusses possible change ,  it can be destabilizing to the organization 


-  ,  Leaders with this experimental orientation may need someone alongside them to keep them grounded 


-  Sharer has learned to impose his own discipline: Ive decided that  need to look at these big-picture options two or three times  year and then put them away 


-  They must force themselves to simplify the message and to translate their thoughts into terms that others relate to 


-  In  New York Times article ,  he recalled  piece of advice he received: A boss once told me: Cris ,  youre  smart guy ,  but that doesnt mean that people can absorb  list of 18 things to do 


-  But now Im at  [senior] level where people are very willing to share their opinion and expect an opinion 


-  So Ive had to teach myself to get out of that conservative zone  and in part ,  Ive done that by volunteering for task forces that give me more of an opportunity to see the big picture 


-  Leaders understanding this tendency in themselves can work to push themselves out of their comfort zone and build up their openness to new experiences 


-  With agreeableness ,  there is no such pattern 


-  ,  To give an extreme example ,  our coaching work with investment bankers revealed  very low average score on agreeableness 


-  Executives who score low on agreeableness provide edge and  results focus that is invaluable in business 


-  Executives who are tough-minded and direct tend to be unflinching in facing conflict and tough issues 


-  The goal is to make it clear that the critique relates to the idea ,  not the individual submitting it 


-  If it is hard to find  diplomatic way of saying what needs saying ,  executives can preface their comments with an acknowledgment that what follows may seem harsh 


-  They may get results ,  but colleagues and subordinates are less likely to trust them 


-  ,  Once he realized the discomfort he was creating for those on the receiving end ,  that executive changed the way he framed his feedback 


-  Rather than laying into the persons flawed logic ,  he developed  softer touch ,  explaining that the proposal was perhaps not yet ready for prime time 


-  But leaders with  low need for agreeableness can also be too guarded and somewhat defensive ,  making it difficult for others to trust them 


-  So at the start of  project ,   always tell them something about myself ,  including my family situation ,  and some of the things  struggle with 


-  ,  Or you can be too considerate 


-  Executives on the more agreeable end of the scale are both trusting and trustworthy 


-  They are likely to promote collaboration and to be attentive to others opinions ,  development needs and well-being 


-  But agreeable executives can have difficulty delivering negative feedback or making decisions that risk upsetting others 


-  When asked about her greatest weaknesses in the Age ,  she replied: I can be too nice when tough decisions need to be made ,  which is not helpful to anyone 


- 14 ,  Highly agreeable executives must ask themselves: Why do  have this need to be liked? Of course ,  the answer may go deep into childhood ,  but posing the question at least launches the reflection process 


-  More practically ,  we encourage these executives to switch mind-sets from I want to be liked to I want to be perceived as fair 


-  Research by organizational behavior scholar Daan van Knippenberg and his colleagues has shown that fairness is the dominant concern when employees evaluate managers ,  not likability 


- 15 ,  Conscientiousness reflects the extent to which we want to structure and organize our lives 


-  As he put it: I have quite an appetite for details ,  so once  get to hear of  problem ,   keep asking questions and  have difficulty letting go of it 


-  ,  Executives with this tendency need to ask themselves: Is this  high-leverage activity  or could my time be better invested elsewhere? They also need to authorize their direct reports to repeat this question whenever it seems like the executive is getting bogged down in time-wasting details 


-  Perfectionist executives need to put on their coaching hats and switch to questioning mode ,  so that their input comes across as help ,  not control 


-   feel an intense responsibility for my area to the extent that  just lose balance   work too hard ,   neglect my health and my family 


-  And ,  of course ,  the less time  spend with my family ,  the less  feel like  belong with them  and the more  throw myself into the work 


-  ,  An unhealthy commitment to work is not something executives can change overnight 


-  While some leaders can be inclined to overanalyze before making up their minds ,  others realize that they tend to make decisions quickly ,  based on instinct 


-  For example ,  William Green ,  chairman of Accenture ,  told the New York Times that he has learned to become more methodical and less seat of the pants in his decision-making style as he rose through the ranks: I have purposely tried to get better grounding in the analytics behind the decision making and used that to check to see if there was  huge disconnect between what my instinct told me and what the analytics told me 


- 16 ,  For executives low on decision-making caution ,  it can be helpful to appoint someone to play devils advocate  someone who has full license from the executive to question his or her snap decisions without negative career consequences 


-  The inevitable starting point is self-awareness 


-  In fact ,   survey of 75 members of the Stanford Graduate School of Business Advisory Council rated self-awareness as the most important capability for leaders to develop 


- 17 Executives need to know where their natural inclinations lie in order to boost them or compensate for them 


-  ,  Sometimes self-awareness comes early in ones career ,  prompted by  comment from  trusted colleague or boss 


-  In an article in Fortune International ,  Lauren Zalaznick ,  now chairman ,  Entertainment  Digital Networks and Integrated Media for NBCUniversal ,  recalled that the best advice she ever received was from her first boss ,  who told her: Throughout your career ,  youre going to hear lots of feedback from show-makers and peers and employees and bosses 


-  If you hear  certain piece of feedback consistently and you dont agree with it ,  it doesnt matter what you think 


-  Truth is ,  youre being perceived that way 


-  ,  On her rise to the top ,  PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi has also benefited from constructive feedback: Im  pretty honest and outspoken person ,  she told the Wall Street Journal Europe 


-  [Other executives] would say ,  You know ,  thats very interesting 


-  And self-awareness is one of the most frequently cited outcomes of leadership coaching 


-  Earlier in his career ,  he was summoned to his bosss office and told that his colleagues did not trust him 


-  The journey is not over ,  but Ive changed enough to say honestly that today ,   would not employ  manager who behaves the way  did back then 


-  He told the Independent: Every single time  am asked to do this sort of thing  and make  spectacle of myself ,  there is always something in the pit of my stomach that turns 


-  Accustomed to dominating meetings ,  he could not help stepping in to provide the answer 


-  The behavioral skills associated with coaching  ( asking questions ,  active listening ,  making suggestions ,  providing feedback )  counteract several excesses simultaneously 


-  ,  For executives who do not feel up to making such behavioral changes ,  self-awareness helps in two other ways 


-  ,  Second ,  self-awareness alerts us to activities and situations we are likely to find difficult 


-  If you tend to be disorganized ,  find someone who is meticulous; if you tend toward the big picture ,  find  pragmatist; if you tend to be impulsive ,  find someone more risk averse; if you tend to be too trusting or open ,  find someone more skeptical or politically astute 


-  At  joint coaching session we held with two executives from the packaging industry ,   divisional director and his deputy ,  the former observed: Looking at our scores ,   can see how he complements me on several dimensions where  am  bit extreme  which may be something  sensed when  chose him [as deputy] and certainly explains some of our fights 


-  ,  In general ,  aspiring leaders need to become aware of their outlier tendencies and learn how they are perceived by others
