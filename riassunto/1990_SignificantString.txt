- FOR SOME decades now ,  marketing textbooks and professors have assiduously distinguished between sales and marketing 


-  Theodore Levitts 1960 definition is still the classic: Selling is preoccupied with the sellers need to convert his product into cash; marketing with the idea of satisfying the needs of the customer by means of the product and the whole cluster of things associated with creating ,  delivering ,  and finally consuming it 


-  Nonetheless ,  whatever else marketing encompasses ,  it certainly includes sellingthe getting and keeping of customers and revenues 


-  As the old saying goes ,  In most companies ,  sales is the only revenue-generating function; everything else is  cost center 


-  Sales importance as  source of revenue tends to define the form and substance of companies marketing programsfor both good  (  


-  ,  close attention to buying processes at specific accounts )  and ill  (  


-  ,  confusion between sales and marketing )  


-  ,  Of all sales issues ,  compensation is probably the most discussed 


-  It is now the focus of  vast and varied literature with enough folk wisdom and quantitative studies to satisfy most managerial temperaments 


-  But the great bulk of this literature focuses on what might be called compensation hydraulics: push this pay lever ,  is the typical claim ,  and get this kind of field sales behavior 


-  Lost in this approach is  recognition that sales compensation is an area in which data analysis ,  values ,  and the motivation of complex human beings are inextricably linked 


-  The frequent result is that managers ,  focused on the hydraulics ,  forget that addressing the fundamental question ,  How should we pay the people responsible for dealing with customers? inevitably implicates  range of issues involved in sales management ,  as well as other aspects of the business 


-  The emphasis of the sales compensation plan will affect the quantity and kinds of orders received by manufacturing ,  the cash-flow profile managed by finance ,  the recruitment and training needs faced by marketing and personnel ,  and the daily organizational interactions between sales and all of these other functional areas 


-  ,  To make these decisions ,  managers need  preface to sales compensation which outlines the issues that must be addressed before worrying about the specific numbers or debating between incentive-based and fixed-salary plans 


-  In that spirit ,  this article provides the following:  (  )   discussion of links between compensation ,  evaluation ,  and motivation;  (  )  an analytical process for developing  compensation plan;  (  )  an examination of the important choices made in setting goals and rewarding results in sales; and  (  )   consideration of the relevance and limits of compensation policies within  healthy and effective sales management system 


-  ,  We pay for product ,  not for process ,  is  sentiment one often hears voiced 


-  This view nicely emphasizes the importance of resultsnot just good intentionsin business 


-  But it must not obscure the fact that compensation is primarily  motivational tool and ,  in most companies ,  an evaluation mechanism as well 


-  One can still design  sales compensation plan on the basis of results rather than process  (  separate issue which is discussed below )  


-  But at its most effective ,  compensation is  tool for achieving sales performance consistent with marketing strategy ,   key means of guiding effort toward desired results 


-  This view has two important implications:  (  )  compensation ,  evaluation ,  and other motivational procedures should be linked coherently in the sales management system; and  (  )  despite the importance of individual abilities in sales ,  the sales rep is ,  ultimately ,  not an individual contributor within the organization; he or she should be viewed as the agent of the firms marketing strategy ,  and the compensation plan designed accordingly 


-  ,  Issues of compensation ,  evaluation ,  and motivation do not ,  of course ,  have strict cause and effect relationships 


-  However ,  it is useful to risk oversimplification and consider them as links in  chain in order to illustrate certain relationships that tend to be ignored  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  Motivation is  core function of management 


-  At the heart of most managerial responsibilities is the question ,  How do  get other people to do as much as possible of the right kind of work?3 In sales ,  motivation involves many factors 


-  One factor is the recruitment policies which influence the personal characteristics of salespeople  (  


-  Some people work harder than others ,  and some people are smarter than others 


-   second factor is the salespersons territory or account characteristics ,  which define the opportunities available and often provide direction for the salespersons efforts 


-  The salespersons perceptions of the connections among effort ,  results ,  and rewards constitute  third factor 


-  In some instances ,  working harder or smarter may not translate into better sales results due to the firms product policy ,  pricing ,  or competitive situation; in other instances ,  better efforts by the salesperson may indeed lead to better sales results ,  but the firms measurement ,  compensation ,  and recognition systems may not acknowledge them 


-  Finally ,   fourth factor affecting motivation is the perceived value of additional rewards 


-  Effort ,  results ,  and rewards may be linked ,  but salespeople may perceive the effort as disproportionately high relative to the rewards received 


-  Many sales incentive systems ,  for example ,  pay salespeople for incremental volume increases over previous years results ,  intending to motivate salespeople to develop new business 


-  But in many selling situations ,  the effort required to develop this business is perceived as not worth it by the sales rep who has  base of mature but steady accounts in his or her territory 


-  ,  An outcome of motivation is effort ,  which ,  in sales ,  has two dimensions: quantity and type 


-  Quantity refers to the sheer amount of effort expended by salespeople as measured by call frequency ,  number of accounts ,  orders booked ,  or other relevant activities 


-  Type refers to such factors as the focus of the salesforces account development versus account maintenance activities ,  the relative emphasis on new versus established products ,  or  ( in some situations )  an emphasis on selling products that generate revenue and manufacturing volume versus products that may have higher margins but lower unit sales 


-  Compensation plans influence both dimensions of effort 


-  ,  Effort leads to results 


-  The issue in sales compensation is deciding what goals should be established in an attempt to guide efforts toward desired results 


-  Some important choices in setting goals and rewarding results will be discussed in  later section 


-  ,  Having established goals ,  results must be measured ,  raising issues of the appropriate  ( or feasible )  measurement criteria ,  the information systems available to provide the data for such measurements ,  and the process by which evaluations are conducted 


-  There are many possible criteria for evaluating sales performance 


-  Often ,  however ,  the companys information systems do not gather the relevant data ,  or salesforce call reports  ( an important source of sales data in most companies )  may be noisy or unreliable 


-  Equally important ,  but often overlooked ,  is the process for administering the evaluations 


-  At many companies ,  salespeople receive big bonuses for the results of their efforts 


-  But the process of providing this additional compensation is at odds with the companys formal performance evaluation of that personthat is ,  the basis of the bonus  (  


-  ,  orders booked by an individual rep )  often contradicts what the company and sales managers say they want in individual performance-evaluation sessions  (  


-  ,  cross-referrals ,  joint presentations ,  or other aspects of team selling )  


-  The result is demotivation or ,  perhaps worse ,  motivation toward the wrong type of sales effort 


-  We may pay for product ,  not process ,  but if we ignore process in  sales environment ,  we often dont get what weve paid for 


-  ,  Finally ,  managers must consider the mechanics of the compensation plan both type and quantity 


-  Type refers to issues such as the relative emphasis on base salary or incentive pay; quantity refers both to the total amount of compensation provided relative to industry norms and ,  within  sales organization ,  the amount of compensation provided for performing  given sales task 


-  ,  The important point stressed here ,  however ,  is that there are links  ( intended or unintended )  between sales compensation ,  evaluation ,  and motivation 


-  The framework sketched in Figure  provides the following advice to managers: Start with the engine  ( the types of efforts and behavior desired of salespeople )  ,  and then design the transmission  ( the specific compensation plan aimed at encouraging these efforts )  


-  ,  Developing and implementing  sales compensation plan requires an analytical process that answers the five questions examined in this section 


-  ,  The starting point for analyzing sales-management requirements ,  including compensation ,  should be the nature of the sales task 


-  This means considering the competitive environment ,  the firms marketing strategy in that environment  ( overall and by segment )  ,  and the essential functions to be performed by the salespeople 


-  But developing  compensation plan requires disaggregating this category into its constituent parts: How much of selling in  given market is attention to delivery? Price negotiations? Distributor network relations? Customer education? Technical expertise? Personal relationships? Services of various kinds? Cold calling? Sheer persistence? ,  Moreover ,  the relative importance of these various aspects changes over the course of  product life cycle or as competition in an industry evolves 


-  In the early stages of  products life cycle ,  for instance ,  customer education or applications development are often key sales tasks ,  especially for technically complex products 


-  But as the market develops and standards emerge ,  salespeople typically spend more time selling against functionally equivalent brands or developing working relationships with intermediaries as well as end users 


-  Such was the case at  number of computer manufacturers during much of the 1980s 


-  As hardware margins declined ,  many computer firms franchised distributors ,  value-added resellers  ( VARs )  ,  and other intermediaries ,  often establishing  certain order-volume size below which sales were to be made through intermediaries 


-  Then ,  as networking and common product interfaces began to emerge ,  manufacturers found it difficult to differentiate themselves on the basis of the price or performance characteristics of their hardware 


-  Software applications and the assembly of different manufacturers products into networked packages became key in many market segments; VARs ,  focused on specific industry or occupational groups ,  often had the expertise and customer contacts for these functions 


-  But many manufacturers provided little or no incentive for their direct sales-forces to work with these influential intermediaries through cross-referrals ,  training ,  joint sales calls ,  or help with specific applications 


-  Indeed ,  at many companies ,  the compensation plan effectively encouraged salespeople to sell at the end-user level against the intermediary; frequently the manufacturer and its reseller both lost the sale 


-  ,  One reason for this misfit in  changing marketplace is that the people making important sales compensation decisions at many firms tend to be headquarters marketing or personnel managers 


-  They may have been in the field some years previously ,  but now base their compensation decisions on an obsolete vision of the actual tasks facing field sales personnel 


-  The lesson here is that there is finally no substitute for ongoing field interaction ,  including actual sales calls ,  by those responsible for sales compensation decisions 


-  This qualitative information is  necessary complement to hard aggregate data about the companys customers and markets ,  and  key step in developing ,  and maintaining ,   coherent ,  relevant picture of important sales tasks 


-  If ,  for example ,  wining and dining or attendance at industry trade shows are important aspects of the sales task ,  then the compensation plans treatment of expenses should not discourage salespeople from developing the contacts ,  relationships ,  and knowledge accrued through these activities 


-  ,  What is the nature of the selling cycle? The answer to this question often varies by major account or important segment 


-  But  plan that focuses on short-term incentives will almost certainly discourage attention to the longer-term  ( and ,  often ,  higher margin )  accounts or market segments 


-  ,  What are the controllable and uncontrollable factors? Salespeople cannot control some of the factors that affect sales performance  (  


-  ,  macro-economic developments ,   customers unforeseen demise ,  competitive moves )  


-  The compensation plan can encourage attention to these factors by rewarding accurate forecasting or market intelligence ,  but the plan should focus on the factors that the salesperson can control 


-  If not ,  important links between motivation ,  effort ,  results ,  and compensation are broken 


-  ,  Information about the amount and kind of compensation offered by competitors is always around the sales office ,  and comparisons are inevitable 


-   firm with uncompetitive pay levels will inevitably lose its best sales personnel ,  and perhaps inadvertently fuel what one sales manager calls the finishing-school syndrome: At my previous company ,  we hired relatively new people ,  trained them ,  gave them experience selling in this industry ,  and then ,  like me ,  they moved on to better-paying jobs at competitors 


-  Many companies spend  considerable amount of time determining competitive pay levels ,  yet this information is easily available through trade publications or published surveys 


-  ,  An additional issue in determining labor-pool context concerns the salespersons potential influence on the buying decision and the abilities required to exert this influence 


-  In many industries ,  sales requires technical skills ,  which means companies must recruit highly trained personnel who often have  number of options in different industries and in different functions besides sales 


-  This factor affects pay levels independent of competitors wage rates 


-  These assets are specialized knowledge and working relationships built up over time by the people selling  product ,  and specialized to the task of selling that product 


-  They may include technical skills or simply detailed knowledge of the decision makers and decision-making processes at important accounts 


-  When salespeople have developed such transaction-specific assets ,  the costs of losing these sales personnel may be prohibitive ,  and the compensation plan should reflect this 


-  ,  An example of such  situation is the private banking business  (  


-  During the past decade ,  most commercial banks aggressively pursued the sizable fee income ,  high margins ,  and large and stable deposit base that  productive private banking group can produce 


-  The key to this business is the private banker ,  who must possess an array of company-specific and client-specific skills 


-  Private banking positions require individuals with knowledge of  broad range of areas ,  including credit ,  marketing ,  operations ,  and special products 


-  Referrals ,  leads ,  and effective attention from other parts of the bank are crucial 


-  At the same time ,  personalized client service is the heart of the business ,  especially since any one banks products are not highly differentiated from competitors offerings 


-  Trust ,  compatibility ,  and other elements of good chemistry are the essence of the private banker-client relationship and ,  over time ,  most clients see themselves as doing business with an individual private banker rather than the commercial bank 


-  This combination of skills is rare ,  narrowing the pool of qualified candidates for private banking positions ,  and also highly dependent on accumulated transaction-specific experience with the company and the client 


-  As  result ,  compensation for private bankers  ( traditionally ,  in keeping with banks historical adherence to internal compensation parity ,   salary commensurate with that of the banks other commercial lenders )  increased in the 1980s at annual rates two to three times that of other bank categories 


-  ,  Management must also determine the relative emphasis on fixed salary and incentive compensation  ( commissions ,  bonuses ,  etc 


-  Several factors make  higher salary component attractive: the difficulty in measuring the impact of  salespersons performance in  reasonable period of time; the need for salespeople to coordinate efforts  (  


-  ,  team selling or national account programs )  the complexity and length of the selling task; the importance of nonselling activities such as after-sale services; the amount of missionary selling required; and the volatility of demand in  product market 


-  ,  These factors tend to make salary  more important factor than incentives in the total sales compensation mix 


-  But  company can have  highly leveraged  (  


-  ,  high commission component )  compensation plan and still sell highly technical ,  complex products in  market environment where non-selling activities and long-term relationships are importantif other aspects of the sales management system support the required sales tasks 


-   number of manufacturers rep firms selling high-technology products operate very successfully with highly leveraged compensation plans 


-  Also ,  many sales managers stress that the issues of fixed salary and incentive compensation  ( the focus of most academic discussions and models of compensation )  may be less important than issues such as: the time frame for compensation pay-outs and performance evaluations; the way sales credit is divided among  dispersed account team or different sales groups; the unit (  )  of measurement used to coordinate compensation plans among different salespeople  (  


-  ,  units sold or gross profit )  and the role of any compensation plan  ( fixed salary or more leveraged )  in the context of the sales organizations more general reward and recognition systems 


-  ,  reaching certain decision makers at  key account )  ,  or they can be administered at the discretion of  particular manager 


-  Most companies apply  standard commission rate to all sales ,  while others vary the commission rate by product or category of customer in order to reflect profitability or competitive objectives 


-  ,  Managers should pay close attention to these details 


-  Salespeople study their firms plan closely ,  and many look for what managers often call loopholes and what  salesperson might well call the best use of my time in order to maximize income 


-  Apparently incidental matters ,  such as paying commissions when orders are booked instead of when shipped ,  can make major differences in the companys cash flow ,  order patterns ,  production schedules ,  and focus of selling efforts 


-  Hence ,  the specific company context is crucial 


-  ,  First ,  sales incentives typically have three allied purposes:  (  )  to communicate managements goals and direct salesforce efforts;  (  )  to increase return on investment in the firms sales capacity; and  (  )  to provide competitive pay to salespeople 


-  Like wages ,  compensation plans are always important company communications 


-  The issue is ,  what behavior is encouraged or discouraged by the incentive portion of the plan?  related issue concerns the incremental efforts to be encouraged by the incentive plan 


-  In effect ,  the purpose of incentives is to increase the firms return on its investment in sales resources by directing effort toward areas where both the firm and the individual salesperson can prosper 


-  Finally ,  the incentive system should be structured so that ,  given  good performance ,  total compensation is at or above competitive pay levels; given varying performance scenarios ,  the ensuing spread in incentive pay should be meaningful and appropriate 


-  In general ,  it should be short enough to make an impact but long enough to make each payment significant 


-  The principle here is that the time frame should make the cause-and-effect relationships among effort ,  results ,  and rewards visible to the salesforce 


-  Generally ,  this means trying to establish incentive plans that conform to the typical selling cycle encountered by salespeople 


-  ,  Third ,  establishing the overall mix between incentive pay and salary  ( the majority of compensation systems have both )  involves judging the interplay of four key variables: the percentage of total compensation at risk via incentives; the salesforces perceptions about this proportion of incentive pay; the degree of implied management control; and the degree of fixed cost reduction attainable through incentive  ( rather than fixed salary )  compensation 


-  As an example ,   senior sales manager in an office products business  ( where the average total compensation per salesperson was about $50 , 000 in 1987 )  uses Table  to consider the interplay of these variables 


-  ,  Fourth ,  the performance measures on which incentives are based should reflect important managerial objectives 


-  While sales volume is probably the most common measure used for incentive systems ,  there are other possible performance measures 


-  For example: ,  Clearly ,  no one form of sales compensation plan is optimal for all companies ,  or even for different divisions in the same company 


-  The nature of the sales tasks ,  and the nature of the salespersons influence on the buying decision  (  factor affected by marketing strategy )  ,  will help to indicate the most suitable form 


-  ,   key choice in any compensation system is the process adopted for setting goals and rewarding results 


-  This is  complex issue ,  involving the mechanics of the particular compensation system ,  the information and administrative talent available to the company ,  and ,  in most situations ,  questions about the basic social contract  company seeks to establish with its sales personnel 


-  There are two basic approaches available ,  as suggested by Figure  


- 11 ,  An emphasis on product over process generally leads to the approach outlined on the left side of Figure  


-  Management sets goals ,  sends the sales-force out into the field ,  and waits for results 


-  It rewards on the basis of whether or not the goals are met 


-  The reasoning here is that  (  )  the salesperson can best decide how to meet those goals  ( Isnt that what we pay them for ,  anyway? )   (  )  over time ,   natural selection process will retain the best salespeople while the others leave for lack of rewards; and  (  )  salespeople are inherently entrepreneurs who resist attempts to control the focus of their field activities 


-  ,  In the approach outlined on the right side of Figure  ,  management rewards specific activities aimed at achieving the desired results and attempts to directly influence those results 


-  This approach assumes first that ,  in the absence of clearly defined and prioritized sales activities ,  the salesperson may not be the best person to design  strategy for reaching goals; sales managers should understand the sales tasks facing their company and improve the performance of those tasks  ( Isnt that what managers get paid for ,  anyway? )  


-  Second ,  over time ,  the former approach can significantly waste and misdirect effort by salespeople ,  especially since the most productive sales activities are likely to change during  products life cycle or as  market grows and matures 


-  Third ,  salespeople may well be entrepreneurs ,  but successful entrepreneurs typically endorse processes that increase their earnings; the issue is not whether salespeople like to be told what to do ,  but whether the company exerts its influence on salespeople in the right directions 


-  Ultimately ,  the function of management is not to administer tests but to optimize the allocation of resources ,  including sales resources 


-  ,  These philosophical differences have significant implications 


-  The choice of approach affects all major dimensions of sales managementrecruitment criteria ,  training initiatives ,  first-level sales management ,  performance evaluation criteria ,  and compensation 


-  Further ,  as international markets ,  global accounts ,  team-selling activities ,  and new technologies make the selling process more complex in many industries ,  the essentially laissez-faire approach outlined on the left side of Figure  is effective in fewer situations 


-  However ,  many companies adopt this approach without considering the alternative method ,  because they think it is not applicable 


-  ,  You wont get what you dont pay for is  fact of life in most sales organizations 


-  But compensation issues are ultimately what some writers have called organizational hygiene factors:12 necessary ,  but not sufficient ,  conditions for motivating people to do what you want them to do 


-   compensation plan is  part of ,  not  substitute for ,   coherent sales management system 


-  ,  Developing an outstanding salesforce is ,  in the final analysis ,   function of the firms total environment ,  including its external market and internal organization  ( management ,  value ,  and information systems )  


-  While  sales compensation plan affects the companys revenue stream and its pattern of resource allocations in many areas besides sales ,  problems with sales compensation are often really symptoms of weaknesses in sales management or other areas of the firm 


-  As noted earlier ,  moreover ,  many other factors besides compensation affect sales results 


-  These include economic conditions ,  competitive initiatives ,  pricing ,  and product quality 


-  ,  Hence ,  it is important to recognize both the relevance and limits of compensation issues 


-  In analyzing sales situations ,  consider the following four factors as part of  quick audit of sales management policies and practices: ,  Evaluating comparative pay levels and deciding the relative emphasis of fixed salary or commission compensation are the outputs of the process outlined here and ,  in many respects ,  the easier aspects of compensation design 


-  Managers also sensitive to issues of motivation ,  evaluation criteria ,  goal setting ,  and rewards ,  can avoid unpleasant surprises and misdirected effort ,  both by themselves and field salespeople 


-  First ,  it suggests  framework that places in context some of the topics discussed in this article ,  such as compensation systems ,  the analysis of sales tasks ,  and the role of sales management in influencing types of selling behavior 


-  Second ,  it includes aspects of sales management not discussed here but that are nonetheless important in analyzing sales situations and compensation issues 


-  Salesforce control systems refers to aspects of sales management that are relatively quantitative and measurable ,  and susceptible to management by objectives ,  or policy direction by sales management 


-  It includes performance measurement ,  evaluation ,  compensation ,  and training systems 


-  In contrast ,  salesforce environment refers to more qualitative issues concerning human resource patterns  (  


-  ,  management of conflicts )  ,  and management patterns  (  


-  ,  the way goals are set and results rewarded )  


-  For example ,  what  company measures and rewards will affect its sales process; conversely ,  how salespeople interact should affect what  company decides to measure ,  train ,  and reward 


-  In turn ,  both the control systems and environment will affect the focus of the companys sales personnel ,  their types of selling behavior ,  and their performance of required sales tasks 


-  ,  Using the framework in Figure  ,   manager contemplating  change in sales compensation might first want to consider the following questions: ,  The basic idea behind this framework is that  sales management system must integrate three factors internal to the sales organization with two factors external to the sales organization 


-  The internal factors are the following: ,  The external factors are as follows: ,  The external factors largely determine the nature of required sales tasks; the internal factors influence selling behaviors to ensure optimal performance of those tasks 


-  ,  When these factors are coherently integrated ,  the company is focusing on customer encounters ,  and selling has travelled  long way toward effective marketing 


-  No one has to teach an infant to walk ,  or talk ,  or master the spatial relationships needed to stack eight building blocks that dont topple 


-  ,  Our prevailing system of management has destroyed our people ,  writes  


-  People are born with intrinsic motivation ,  self-esteem ,  dignity ,  curiosity to learn ,  joy in learning 


-  The forces of destruction begin with toddlers   prize for the best Halloween costume ,  grades in school ,  gold stars ,  and on up through the university 


-  On the job ,  people ,  teams ,  divisions are ranked  reward for the one at the top ,  punishment at the bottom 


-  MBO quotas ,  incentive pay ,  business plans ,  put together separately ,  division by division ,  cause further loss ,  unknown and unknowable 


-  ,  Ironically ,  by focusing on performing for someone elses approval ,  corporations create the very conditions that predestine them to mediocre performance 


-  Over the long run ,  superior performance depends on superior learning 


-  On the other hand ,  de Geus and his colleagues at Shell also found  small number of companies that survived for seventy-five years or longer 


-  Interestingly ,  the key to their survival was the ability to run experiments in the margin ,  to continually explore new business and organizational opportunities that create potential new sources of growth 


-  ,  If anything ,  the need for understanding how organizations learn and accelerating that learning is greater today than ever before 


-  While the challenge is great ,  so is the potential payoff 


-  The person who figures out how to harness the collective genius of the people in his or her organization ,  according to former Citibank CEO Walter Wriston ,  is going to blow the competition away 


-  ,  The prevailing view of learning organizations emphasizes increased adaptability 


-  Given the accelerating pace of change ,  or so the standard view goes ,  the most successful corporation of the 1990s ,  according to Fortune magazine ,  will be something called  learning organization ,   consummately adaptive enterprise 


-  As the Shell study shows ,  examples of traditional authoritarian bureaucracies that responded too slowly to survive in changing business environments are legion 


-  The impulse to learn ,  at its heart ,  is an impulse to be generative ,  to expand our capability 


-  This is why leading corporations are focusing on generative learning ,  which is about creating ,  as well as adaptive learning ,  which is about coping 


-  With its emphasis on continuous expenmentation and feedback ,  the total quality movement has been the first wave in building learning organizations 


-  But Japanese firms view of serving the customer has evolved 


-  In the early years of total quality ,  the focus was on fitness to standard ,  making  product reliably so that it would do what its designers intended it to do and what the firm told its customers it would do 


-  Then came  focus on fitness to need ,  understanding better what the customer wanted and then providing products that reliably met those needs 


-  Today ,  leading edge firms seek to understand and meet the latent need of the customerwhat customers might truly value but have never experienced or would never think to ask for 


-  It required  leap of imagination to see what the customer might want 


-  ,  Generative learning ,  unlike adaptive learning ,  requires new ways of looking at the world ,  whether in understanding customers or in understanding how to better manage  business 


-  manufacturers sought competitive advantage in aggressive controls on inventories ,  incentives against overproduction ,  and rigid adherence to production forecasts 


-  Despite these incentives ,  their performance was eventually eclipsed by Japanese firms who saw the challenges of manufacturing differently 


-  They realized that eliminating delays in the production process was the key to reducing instability and improving cost ,  productivity ,  and service 


-  They worked to build networks of relationships with trusted suppliers and to redesign physical production processes so as to reduce delays in materials procurement ,  production set up ,  and in-process inventory   much higher-leverage approach to improving both cost and customer loyalty 


-  ,  As Boston Consulting Groups George Stalk has observed ,  the Japanese saw the significance of delays because they saw the process of order entry ,  production scheduling ,  materials procurement ,  production ,  and distribution as an integrated system 


-  ,  I talk with people all over the country about learning organizations ,  and the response is always very positive ,  says William OBrien ,  CEO of the Hanover Insurance companies 


-  If this type of organization is so widely preferred ,  why dont people create such organizations?  think the answer is leadership 


-  ,  Our traditional view of leaders  as special people who set the direction ,  make the key decisions ,  and energize the troops  is deeply rooted in an individualistic and nonsystemic worldview 


-  So long as such myths prevail ,  they reinforce  focus on short-term events and charismatic heroes rather than on systemic forces and collective learning 


-  In  learning organization ,  leaders roles differ dramatically from that of the charismatic decision maker 


-  These roles require new skills: the ability to build shared vision ,  to bring to the surface and challenge prevailing mental models ,  and to foster more systemic patterns of thinking 


-  In short ,  leaders in learning organizations are responsible for building organizations where people are continually expanding their capabilities to shape their future  that is ,  leaders are responsible for learning 


-  create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism 


-  They believe that ,  if only people understood current reality ,  they would surely feel the motivation to change 


-  They are then disappointed to discover that people resist the personal and organizational changes that must be made to alter reality 


-  What they never grasp is that the natural energy for changing reality comes from holding  picture of what might be that is more important to people than what is 


-  Many people and organizations find themselves motivated to change only when their problems are bad enough to cause them to change 


-  With problem solving ,  the motivation for change is extrinsic 


-  With creative tension ,  the motivation is intrinsic 


-  What is your role? ,   have asked this question of groups of managers many times 


-  While these are legitimate leadership roles ,  there is another which ,  in many ways ,  eclipses them all in importance 


-  The consequences that appear today are the result of work done long in the past ,  and work today will show its benefits far in the future 


-  The first task of organization design concerns designing the governing ideas of purpose ,  vision ,  and core values by which people will live 


-  Few acts of leadership have  more enduring impact on an organization than building  foundation of purpose and core values 


-  ,  In 1982 ,  Johnson  Johnson found itself facing  corporate nightmare when bottles of its best-selling Tylenol were tampered with ,  resulting in several deaths 


-  Although the immediate cost was significant ,  no other action was possible given the firms credo 


-  Authored almost forty years earlier by president Robert Wood Johnson ,  Johnson  Johnsons credo states that permanent success is possible only when modern industry realizes that: ,  Such statements might seem like motherhood and apple pie to those who have not seen the way  clear sense of purpose and values can affect key business decisions 


-  Johnson  Johnsons crisis management in this case was based on that credo 


-  ,  If governing ideas constitute the first design task of leadership ,  the second design task involves the policies ,  strategies ,  and structures that translate guiding ideas into business decisions 


- 11 Policy making  ( the rules that guide decisions )  ought to be separated from decision making ,  says Jay Forrester 


-  ,  Traditionally ,  writers like Selznick and Forrester have tended to see policy making and implementation as the work of  small number of senior managers 


-  Both the dynamic business environment and the mandate of the learning organization to engage people at all levels now make it clear that this second design task is more subtle 


-  Successful organizations craft strategy according to Mintzberg ,  as they continually learn about shifting business conditions and balance what is desired and what is possible 


-  The choice of individual action is only part of  


-  the policymakers need ,  according to Mason and Mitroff 


- 14 More important is the need to achieve insight into the nature of the complexity and to formulate concepts and world views for coping with it 


-  Around 1971 ,  members of Shells Group Planning in London began to foresee dramatic change and unpredictability in world oil markets 


-  ,  As they pondered this failure ,  the planners view of their basic task shifted: We no longer saw our task as producing  documented view of the future business environment five or ten years ahead 


-  Our real target was the microcosm  ( the mental model )  of our decision makers 


-  It mattered not that the managers believed the planners scenarios absolutely ,  only that they became engaged in ferreting out the implications 


-  In this way ,  Shells planners conditioned managers to be mentally prepared for  shift from low prices to high prices and from stability to instability 


-  The results were significant 


-  When OPEC became  reality ,  Shell quickly responded by increasing local operating company control  ( to enhance maneuverability in the new political environment )  ,  building buffer stocks ,  and accelerating development of non-OPEC sources  actions that its competitors took much more slowly or not at all 


-  ,  Somewhat inadvertently ,  Shell planners had discovered the leverage of designing institutional learning processes ,  whereby ,  in the words of former planning director de Geus ,  Management teams change their shared mental models of their company ,  their markets ,  and their competitors 


- 17 Much of the leverage leaders can actually exert lies in helping people achieve more accurate ,  more insightful ,  and more empowering views of reality 


-  ,  Leader as teacher does not mean leader as authoritarian expert whose job it is to teach people the correct view of reality 


- 18 In learning organizations ,  this teaching role is developed further by virtue of explicit attention to peoples mental models and by the influence of the systems perspective 


-  ,  The role of leader as teacher starts with bringing to the surface peoples mental models of important issues 


-  These mental pictures of how the world works have  significant influence on how we perceive problems and opportunities ,  identify courses of action ,  and make choices 


-  Styling is therefore more important than quality19 The Detroit automakers didnt say ,  We have  mental model that all people care about is styling 


-  Few actual managers would even say publicly that all people care about is styling 


-  Reality ,  as perceived by most people in most organizations ,  means pressures that must be borne ,  crises that must be reacted to ,  and limitations that must be accepted 


-  Leaders as teachers help people restructure their views of reality to see beyond the superficial conditions and events into the underlying causes of problems  and therefore to see new possibilities for shaping the future 


-  ,  Specifically ,  leaders can influence people to view reality at three distinct levels: events ,  patterns of behavior ,  and systemic structure 


-  ,  The key question becomes where do leaders predominantly focus their own and their organizations attention? ,  Contemporary society focuses predominantly on events 


-  The media reinforces this perspective ,  with almost exclusive attention to short-term ,  dramatic events 


-  This focus leads naturally to explaining what happens in terms of those events: The Dow Jones average went up sixteen points because high fourth-quarter profits were announced yesterday 


-  Systemic ,  structural explanations go even further by addressing the question ,  What causes the patterns of behavior? ,  In some sense ,  all three levels of explanation are equally true 


-  Pattern-of-behavior explanations focus on identifying long-term trends and assessing their implications 


-  ,  By and large ,  leaders of our current institutions focus their attention on events and patterns of behavior ,  and ,  under their influence ,  their organizations do likewise 


-  On the other hand ,  leaders in learning organizations pay attention to all three levels ,  but focus especially on systemic structure; largely by example ,  they teach people throughout the organization to do likewise 


-  This conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead 


-  That person is sharply different from one who is leader first ,  perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual power drive or to acquire material possessions 


-  ,  Leaders sense of stewardship operates on two levels: stewardship for the people they lead and stewardship for the larger purpose or mission that underlies the enterprise 


-  If anything ,  people in  learning organization are more vulnerable because of their commitment and sense of shared ownership 


-  They are part of changing the way businesses operate ,  not from  vague philanthropic urge ,  but from  conviction that their efforts will produce more productive organizations ,  capable of achieving higher levels of organizational success and personal satisfaction than more traditional organizations 


-  Likewise ,  when  group of people come to share  vision for an organization ,  each person sees an individual picture of the organization at its best 


-  Its something like poking holes in  window shade; each hole offers  unique angle for viewing the whole image 


-  ,  When you add up the pieces of  hologram ,  something interesting happens 


-  When more people come to share  vision ,  the vision becomes more real in the sense of  mental reality that people can truly imagine achieving 


-  Early on ,  when they are nurturing an individual vision ,  people may say it is my vision 


-  ,  The skills involved in building shared vision include the following: ,  Many of the best ideas in organizations never get put into practice 


- 23 ,  Specifically ,  when advocating  view ,  they need to be able to: ,  When inquiring into anothers views ,  they need to: ,  If they reach an impasse  ( others no longer appear open to inquiry )  ,  they need to: ,  The first challenge is to recognize defensive routines ,  then to inquire into their operation 


-  Can you help me see this better? )  ,  We all know that leaders should help people see the big picture 


-  They focus less on day-to-day events and more on underlying trends and forces of change 


-  ,  One of the most significant developments in management science today is the gradual coalescence of managerial systems thinking as  field of study and practice 


-  Gore and Associates  ( makers of GoreTex and other synthetic fiber products )  


-  Bill Gore was adept at telling stories that showed how the organizations core values of freedom and individual responsibility required particular operating policies 


-  He was proud of his egalitarian organization ,  in which there were  ( and still are )  no employees ,  only associates ,  all of whom own shares in the company and participate in its management 


-  At one talk ,  he explained the companys policy of controlled growth: Our limitation is not financial resources 


-  He suggests that ,  at larger rates of growth ,  the adverse effects of attempting to integrate too many new people too rapidly would begin to dominate 


-  )  The story also reaffirms the organizations commitment to creating  unique environment for its associates and illustrates the types of sacrifices that the firm is prepared to make in order to remain true to its vision 


-  The last part of the story shows that ,  despite the self-imposed limit ,  the company is still very much  growth company 


-  Eventually ,  the worldview of people in the organization becomes dominated by events and reactiveness 


-  Ironically ,  they often end up being authoritarian leaders ,  even if they dont want to ,  because only they see the decisions that need to be made 


- 25 ,  Some of the system archetypes that have the broadest relevance include: ,  The Archetype template is  specific tool that is helping managers identify archetypes operating in their own strategic areas  ( see Figure  )  


-  The problem they focused on was financial stress ,  which could be dealt with in two different ways: by running marketing promotions  ( the symptomatic solution )  or by product innovation  ( the fundamental solution )  


-  The company was expert in their design and implementation 


-  The results were highly predictable 


-  Product innovation was slow and much less predictable ,  and the company had  history over the past ten years of product-innovation mismanagement 


-  What the managers saw clearly was that the more skillful they became at promotions ,  the more they shifted the burden away from product innovation 


-  Unless the political values shifted back toward product and process innovation ,  the managers realized ,  the firms decline would accelerate  which is just the shift that has happened over the past several years 


-  manufacturers faced the low cost-high quality choice 


-  Not surprisingly ,  given the short-term pressures perceived by most managements ,  the prevailing choice was low cost 


-  The consequences of this perceived either-or choice have been disastrous ,  even fatal ,  as  


-  manufacturers have encountered increasing international competition from firms that have chosen to consistently improve quality and cost 


-  ,  In  recent book ,  Charles Hampden-Turner presented  variety of tools for helping management teams confront strategic dilemmas creatively 


- 28 He summarizes the process in seven steps: ,  The idea that mental models can dominate business decisions and that these models are often tacit and even contradictory to what people espouse can be very threatening to managers who pride themselves on rationality and judicious decision making 


-  ,  When working with managers ,   start this exercise by selecting  specific situation in which  am interacting with other people in  way that is not working ,  that is not producing the learning that is needed 


-  Believing that he lacks confidence ,   skirt the fact that Ive heard the presentation was  bomb 


-  When  ask Bill what we should do next ,  he gives no specific course of action 


-  Believing he lacks initiative ,   take this as evidence of his laziness; he is content to do nothing when action is definitely required 


-   conclude that  will have to manufacture some form of pressure to motivate him ,  or else  will simply have to take matters into my own hands 


-  But the price of avoiding the issue is high 


-  Instead of determining how to move forward to resolve our problems ,  we end our exchange with no clear course of action 


-   resort to  manipulative strategy to move things forward 


-  ,  The exercise not only reveals the need for skills in surfacing assumptions ,  but that we are the ones most in need of help 


-  There is no one right way to handle difficult situations like my exchange with Bill ,  but any productive strategy revolves around  high level of self-disclosure and willingness to have my views challenged 


-   need to recognize my own leaps of abstraction regarding Bill ,  share the events and reasoning that are leading to my concern over the project ,  and be open to Bills views on both 


-  See The Left-Hand Column: An Exercise ,  One of the most promising new tools is the learning laboratory or microworld: constructed microcosms of real-life settings in which management teams can learn how to learn together 


-  Although most management teams have great difficulty learning  ( enhancing their collective intelligence and capacity to create )  ,  in other domains team learning is the norm rather than the exception  team sports and the performing arts ,  for example 


-  The process is  continual movement between practice and performance 


-  ,  The vision guiding current research in management learning laboratories is to design and construct effective practice fields for management teams 


-  ,  First ,  since team learning in organizations is an individual-to-individual and individual-to-system phenomenon ,  learning laboratories must combine meaningful business issues with meaningful interpersonal dynamics 


-  ,  Second ,  the factors that thwart learning about complex business issues must be eliminated in the learning lab 


-  Chief among these is the inability to experience the long-term ,  systemic consequences of key strategic decisions 


-  We all learn best from experience ,  but we are unable to experience the consequences of many important organizational decisions 


-  One constraint on learning is the inability of managers to reflect insightfully on their assumptions and to inquire effectively into each others assumptions 


-  Both skills can be enhanced in  learning laboratory ,  where people can practice surfacing assumptions in  low-risk setting 


-   note of caution: It is far easier to design an entertaining learning laboratory than it is to have an impact on real management practices and firm traditions outside the learning lab 


-  Research on management simulations has shown that they often have greater entertainment value than educational value 


-  One of the reasons appears to be that many simulations do not offer deep insights into systemic structures causing business problems 


-  Warner Burke observe the return of an emphasis on developing leaders who can develop organizations 


-  The 1990s may be the period ,  suggest Sashkin and Burke ,  during which organization development and  (  new sort of )  management development are reconnected 


-  ,   believe that this new sort of management development will focus on the roles ,  skills ,  and tools for leadership in learning organizations 


-  Undoubtedly ,  the ideas offered above are only  rough approximation of this new territory 


- THE DOWNTOWN Chicago Marriott hotel had been open for fifteen years before its management determined that two-thirds of all guest calls to housekeeping were to request ironing boards 


-  This discovery prompted the idea of simply placing irons and ironing boards in all of the hotels guest rooms ,  an idea that would cost $20 , 000 


-  So the manager eliminated the color television sets and added the irons and ironing boards with no net addition to the capital budget ,   big productivity boost for housekeeping ,  and  new ,  important guest room feature 


-  The first is that customers are the sole judge of service quality 


-   company can achieve  strong reputation for quality service only when it consistently meets customer service expectations 


-  Managers nod their heads in agreement when convention speakers stress the importance of customer focus and then go back to work and buy the equivalent of color TVs for the bathroom instead of ironing boards 


-  We have done extensive research with customers ,  front-line service providers ,  and managers in our studies of six service sectors: appliance repair ,  credit cards ,  insurance ,  long-distance telephone ,  retail banking ,  and securities brokerage 


-  ,  Through our studies ,  we have been able to identify the principal dimensions customers use to judge  companys service: ,  Knowing what customers expect is ,  of course ,  only part of the challenge 


-  In this article we attempt to answer  fundamental question: What must every company interested in improving service do to actually improve it? We answer in terms of five service imperatives: define the service role ,  compete for talent  ( and use it )  ,  emphasize service teams ,  go for reliability ,  and be great at problem resolution 


-  ,  The above quotations from our research illustrate  common failing in service organizations: managements failure to properly define and reinforce the service role for employees 


-  The result is service role ambiguity; the concept of service is vague and non-credible 


-  They include the following: ,  Service standards are customer expectations stated in  way that is meaningful to employees 


-  If well conceived ,  the standards guide and energize employees; they clarify the service task ,  convey  sense of priority ,  and provide benchmarks against which employees can judge their own performance and managers can judge the employees and the organizations performance 


-  Service standards bring  customer focus into the employees day-to-day reality of service delivery 


-  ,   common assumption is that contact personnel understand their customers service priorities by virtue of regular customer contact 


-  Our data reveals that managers in five major service companies had  more accurate grasp of customer expectations than did front-line contact employees 


-  ,  What it boils down to is this: If employees are unsure of how to deliver excellent service ,  if they think they know how but are wrong ,  or if they believe management does not really care about service ,  they are unlikely to deliver excellent service 


-  ,  Defining the service role effectively starts with formal research to identify customers principal service expectations 


-  Guessing at what customers value most in service introduces  Russian roulette dynamic into the entire chain of service-improving actions ,  from setting service standards to the staffing ,  training ,  measuring ,  appraising ,  and rewarding decisions required to support the standards 


-  ,  Although the five service dimensions presented earlier provide  framework of customer expectations ,  each company must still do its own research to measure the relative importance of the service dimensions among customers ,  prospects ,  and different market segments 


-  The firm must also assess company and competitor performance against customer expectations 


-  For example ,   firm will want to set standards for service dimensions that are important to target markets and on which the companys performance is weak compared to competitors 


-  ,  Research also helps managers make choices among service standards and pare down the list of standards to the pivotal ones that will make  difference for customers 


-  Customers judge  companys service on the basis of  very few important service factors ,  and managers should establish  limited set of service standards for individual employees that contributes to the limited set of service goals for the organization 


-  ,  The most successful service companies focus employee attention on the preeminent service factors 


-  At Deluxe Corporation  ( formerly Deluxe Check Printers )  ,  the focus is on error-free printing and next-day order shipment 


-  Indeed ,  Sewell Village is one of the few automobile dealerships where the service managers income is as handsome as the sales managers! ,  Still another key to defining the service role is to use every opportunity to communicate and reinforce service standardsin meetings and training sessions; in internal media such as wallet cards ,  desk signs ,  and wall posters; and in performance measurement ,  appraisal ,  and reward systems 


-  The explicit standards  ( for example ,  greeting or acknowledging every customer within 30 seconds )  form  basis for training ,  performance measurement ,  appraisal ,  and compensation 


-  ,  Defining employees service roles clearly ,  consistently ,  and credibly is important to any organizations efforts to improve service 


-  The behavior-guiding and motivational benefits of service standards are well worth the investment necessary to develop and reinforce them 


-  Service employees need to know what excellent service meansand why they should care about delivering it 


-  ,  Defining the service role is an important step ,  but it wont get  company very far unless the company has personnel with the attitude ,  ability ,  and flexibility to fulfill the role 


-  Our studies indicate that two of the principal causes of poor service quality are placing the wrong people in the service role and giving employees too little control over the service 


-  Contact employees who believe their units are not meeting service standards disagree with the following statements: ,  Services are performances ,  and most of the time it is people who render these performances 


-  From the customers perspective ,  the people performing the service are the company 


-  An incompetent insurance agent is an incompetent insurance company ,  and  rude waiter is  rude restaurant 


-  ,  So why do managers allow the wrong people to carry the company flag in front of customers? One reason is that most managers do not think like marketers when it comes to human resource issues 


-  They view marketing as something you do to win over customers but not something you do to win over employees 


-  Is this any way to compete for talent? The same companies that advertise imaginatively to compete for customers advertise with no imagination at all to recruit employees 


-  The employment ads are look-alike ads in fine print selling jobs rather than careers 


-  ,  Moreover ,  managers often do not have  well-defined profile of people to hire 


-  They do not base hiring standards on service standards ,  which contributes to  mismatch between the type of people the company actually hires and the type of people the company needs to hire to deliver excellent service 


-  ,  Compounding the mismatch problem is anachronistic thinking about affordable wage rates ,  with the goal of saving money dominating the goal of serving customers 


-  The tendency we observe among service firm managers to spend more liberally on things than people runs counter to our research findings that customers value the human dimensions of service more than the tangibles of service 


-  Notice the expensive floor space ,  displays ,  and inventory ,  and then try to find salespeople who are knowledgeable about the merchandise and who tune into your needs with commitment and grace 


-  ,  The problem of hiring the wrong people is getting worse due to labor-force shortfalls 


-  Service sector employment is expanding rapidly ,  and the skills needed are being elevated just at the time that changing demographics are shrinking the labor pool of young people ,  who in many instances are not receiving the education they need to be marketable 


-  ,  The implications for service quality are sobering 


-  Rather than leave positions unfilled or pay what they consider to be exorbitant wages ,  many managers are hiring people who are woefully ill equipped to deliver excellent service 


-  ,  Thick rule books serve customers no better than employees 


-  They produce regimented ,  by-the-book service when  flexible ,  by-the-customer one is needed 


-  While managers are demanding that employees be robot servers ,  customers are demanding that they be thinking servers 


-  ,  One reason rule book management is so prevalent is that many managers believe it is essential to standardize service among different employees and service units 


-  However ,  another factor is that many managers simply do not trust employees judgment and make rules to replace it with their own 


-  The labor shortfall issue is also  factor 


-  If you cant get good people ,  the theory goes ,  you at least need to make sure you control their work tightly 


-  People who are qualified will perform better and stay with the company longer if given room to maneuver ,  achieve ,  and grow 


-  ,  Excellent service is too integral to  firms future to accept yesterdays ideas about whom to hire ,  how to hire them ,  and what to do with them once hired 


-  Managers need to compete as hard and creatively for talent market share as they compete for sales market share 


-  ,  Here is what we recommend: Market careers rather than jobs ,  market them in multiple ways ,  link hiring standards to service standards ,  and leverage the freedom factor 


-  Companies that do these things will do just fine in the talent market 


-  ,  The idea of career may seem at odds with the demographically fragmented labor pool available and the high cost of employee benefit programs  ( which make part-time workers desirable )  ,  but in fact it is smart to look for the countertrend when prevailing routines are not working 


-  Unlike most department store companies ,  Nordstrom resists the lure of part-time salespeople ,  preferring to staff the stores with full-time personnel 


-  Earning wages plus commissions ,  Nordstrom salespeople earn well above retailing standards 


-  Indeed ,  the most successful Nordstrom salespeople earn more than some of the managers of competing stores in the same malls 


-  Once these employees graduate from college ,  they are promoted into management 


-  ,  Using good old-fashioned marketing fundamentals also makes sense 


-  McDonalds McMaster program to attract older workers ,  Century 21s Career Opportunity Week advertised in national media ,  and Disney Worlds training of existing employees to recruit new employees illustrate the use of such familiar marketing concepts as market segmentation ,  market development ,  and personal selling 


-  ,  It is also important to use service standards as  basis for hiring decisions 


-  This requires having written service standards for the various positions ,  written ideal candidate profiles tiiat reflect the service standards ,  and extensive line involvement in actual hiring decisions 


-  Getting good people requires tenacity 


-  Jim Daniel ,  president of the high-performing Friendly Bank in Oklahoma City ,  makes the point well:2 ,  Of course ,  it does little good to recruit capable ,  service-minded people only to frustrate them into leaving 


-  Competing for talent means having good careers to market ,  not just marketing them well 


-  Human beings were not meant to be robots 


-  ,  To leverage the freedom factor ,  managers have to select their people well ,  provide them with  strong foundational culture in which to work ,  offer them strategic direction ,  and give them the company-specific training and education they need to perform their roles 


-  And then managers need to get out of their way! ,  We agree with Robert Waterman ,  who writes in The Renewal Factor: When managers guide instead of control ,  the skys the limit on what people can accomplish 


-  Companies should also tackle head-on the issue of empowerment in the education and training of managers 


-  Managers must learn the dangers of overmanagement; they must learn to widen the solution boundaries for their people 


-  The sheer number of customers to be served can be psychologically and physically overwhelming 


-  Control over service can be dispersed among multiple organizational units that function without cohesion or  unified spirit ,  limiting contact employees ability to come through for their customers 


-  ,  It is very common for service workers to get beat up by the service role and become less effective even as they gain technical experience that should theoretically produce the opposite result 


-  In numerous cases ,  however ,  what customers perceive as inhospitable behavior is actually the coping behavior of weary servers who have taken too many punches 


-  Many service workers ,  of course ,  do not succumb to the stresses of the service role 


-  Any number of factors can account for the fact that service work pummels and changes some employees more than others 


-  ,  One dynamic that is particularly important in kindling and sustaining service-mindedness is the presence of service teammates 


-  It can also raise the ante for individual performance 


-  ,  Service teamwork is also important because people in service organizations typically depend on one another 


-  The end service the customer receives is commonly the result of many behind-the-scenes ,  internal services 


-  ,  Our research shows convincingly that teamwork is  principal factor in delivering excellent service 


-  Employees who indicate that their organizational units are not meeting service standards disagree with the following statements: ,  Organizational teamwork is clearly not  new idea ,  but it is an idea whose time has come 


-  Marketing researcher Mimi Lieber admonishes top managers to reward cooperative farming rather than the number of pelts 


-  Some degree of structuring ,  assigning ,  and facilitating is needed to overcome organizational inertia 


-  But we believe managers must go beyond this focus to fully reap the benefits of service teamwork 


-  ,  In the 1990s  growing number of service firms will boldly pursue the full benefits of service teamwork by replacing functional organizational structures with market-focused team structures 


-  PHH FleetAmerica ,  the nations largest automobile fleet management company ,  is experimenting with this approach by assigning teams to serve the range of needs of selected large clients 


-  This is in contrast to the firms predominantly functional structure ,  in which various departments specialize in specific tasks  ( such as automobile procurement ,  titles ,  and disposal )  and clients deal with different units for different needs 


-  ,  Aid Association for Lutherans  ( AAL )  totally reorganized its $50 billion insurance business from  functional structure to  market-team structure in 1987 


-  Management is placing people with different specialties together in the same unit and saying ,  Work together as  team ,  take ownership of the customer ,  and improve the way we do things 


-  This approach is promising because it combines into one package close-to-the-customer decision making ,  unified control over the service ,  andmost of allthe team energy about which Mr 


-  ,  Breaking the service promise is the single most important way service companies fail their customers 


-  When  firm is careless in performing the service ,  when it makes mistakes ,  when it doesnt do what it said it would do ,  customers lose confidence in the firms reliability; they lose confidence in the firms wherewithal to do what it promises to do dependably and accurately 


-  ,  We have learned in our research that service reliability is the service core to most customers 


-  Little else matters to customers when  company is not dependable 


-  We have now measured the relative importance of the five service dimensions in nine independent customer samples covering  variety of services 


-  In all nine samples ,  respondents rate reliability as the single most important feature in judging service quality 


-  companies are delivering service reliability is not reassuring 


-  firms ,  are more deficient on the reliability dimension than on any other 


-  ,  We sometimes hear executives say that 98 percent reliability is acceptable and that it is cost-prohibitive to do better 


-  The flip side of 98 percent reliability is  percent unreliability ,  and more than likely ,  the actual cost of  percent unreliability is higher than the cost of improving 98 percent reliability 


-  ,  If executives were to calculate the true costs of service unreliabilitylost customers ,  unfavorable word-of-mouth ,  and redoing services not done properly the first timethey would realize just how much sloppiness steals from the bottom line and that  zero defects attitude is as important in services as in manufacturing 


-  ,  And if more executives were to investigate the primary causes of service unreliability in their companies ,  they would find most of them rooted in poor service design ,  inattention to service details ,  and basic carelessnessproblems that cannot be solved by throwing money at them 


-  ,  Reliability is the heart of excellent service 


-  And it is not just the high-stake services involving our health or financial security for which we demand reliability 


-  And our business 


-  ,  captures the spirit of  zero-defects approach to service:8 ,  Managers should use every opportunity to build  do-it-right-first attitude 


-  This means specifically addressing the reliability issue in company communications ,  including mission statements; setting reliability standards; teaching the why and how of reliability in training programs; appointing reliability teams to study specific services and recommend ways to improve reliability; measuring error rates; and rewarding error-free service 


-  ,  Service reliability is so important that we suggest companies ask each employee to make  formal commitment to it 


-  companies to work for ,  has made service reliability the centerpiece of its Commitment to Excellence statement that each employee signs 


-  ,   Dayton ,  Ohio ,  bookstore whose sales have grown 30 percent  year since 1984 ,  insists that each new employee sign  performance contract that spells out the employees service responsibilities 


-  Several of the clauses pertain directly to service reliability 


-  ,  One of the most important opportunities for improving reliability involves analyzing services for fail pointsthe service processes most vulnerable to mishap 


-  Firms can identify fail points by monitoring service delivery through mystery shoppers and periodic surveys; by soliciting the input of employees actually performing the service; by studying and categorizing customer service complaints; and by mapping the architecture of the service processgenerally referred to as blueprinting 


-  ,  Identifying fail points focuses attention on the need for special training ,  additional inspection ,  building in corrective subprocesses ,  or even redesigning the original process 


-  Consider the case of Florida Power  Light and its quest to reduce the duration and frequency of service interruptions ,   major cause of customer complaints 


-  Serving  part of the country that averages 80 days  year of thunderstorms and lightning ,  the company has developed  sophisticated ,  computer-based lightning tracking system to anticipate where weather-related problems might occur and to strategically position crews to quicken recovery response time 


-  This and other initiatives have enabled the utility to reduce service unavailability  ( customer minutes interrupted divided by customers served )  from 70 minutes at the end of 1987 to 48 


-  The companys target for 1991 is 36 


-  ,  Outstanding service reliability is the foundation on which to build  reputation for outstanding service quality 


-  Companies that consider the service promise inviolate are most likely to earn the confidence of their customers 


-  And the confidence of customers is the greatest asset  company can have 


-  ,  When  customer experiences  problem with  servicewhen something goes awrythe customers confidence is jarred but probably not destroyed ,  unless the problem reflects  pattern of negative experience with the company 


-  The firm can make things better with the customerat least to some extentor much ,  much worse 


-  ,  All too often ,  service companies make things worse 


-  They do not encourage their customers to resolve their problems and set up roadblocks for those who try to do so 


-  ,  Three possibilities arise when  customer experiences  service problem: ,  Of these possible outcomes ,  the first one is good and the last two are very bad 


-  Our sample companies received the most favorable service quality scores from customers who had experienced no recent service problems with them ,  the next most favorable scores from customers whose problems were resolved satisfactorily ,  and the worst scores  ( by far )  from customers whose problems were not resolved satisfactorily 


-  Table  presents these numbers 


-  ,  In effect ,  companies that do not respond effectively to customer complaints compound the failure; they fail to come through for the customer again 


-  At this point ,  the customers shaky confidence in the firm probably collapses 


-  ,  Many dissatisfied customers do not complain ,  often making unflattering comments about the firm and taking their business elsewhere instead 


-  ,  organization noted for its research on customer complaining behavior ,  document that large numbers of customers do not complain because they fear  hassle ,  perceive no easy or efficient way to air their grievances ,  or believe complaining will not do them any good 


-  ,  Managers need to come to grips with the seriousness of the lost business and negative word-of-mouth that occurs when customers cannot resolve problems with the firm ,  or do not even try 


-  How  company handles service problems tells customers  ( and employees )   great deal about the firms service values and priorities 


-  ,  Managers who want to improve problem-resolution service must over come the common customer perception that companies dont really care when things go wrong 


-  The solution calls for some creative marketing of the customer feedback idea 


-  Comment cards available in service delivery facilities and toll-free telephone numbers merely scratch the surface of what is possible 


-  British Airways Video Point booths ,  in which disembarking passengers can videotape their concerns ,  make an unusually strong statement that the company wants to know when its customers are unhappy 


-  ,  Companies frequently make two fatal mistakes in problem resolution: They take too long to respond to customers ,  and they respond impersonally 


-  Timely ,  personal communication with unhappy customers offers  firm the best chance to regain the customers favor 


-  By responding personally ,  with  telephone call or  visit ,  it creates an opportunity for dialogue with customersan opportunity to listen ,  ask questions ,  explain ,  apologize ,  achieve closure 


-  ,  North Carolinas Wachovia Bank  Trust has  sundown ruleemployees must establish contact with  complaining customer before sunset on the day  complaint is received 


-  When Minneapolis First Bank System messed up  direct payroll deposit for  client company in 1988 ,  it immediately sent every employee of that company  $15 check and an apology 


-  In addition ,  the employees were given the name and telephone number of  person at the bank who could answer questions and resolve problems 


-  Silence is not golden when  problem exists and the customer is waiting to hear 


-  ,  Companies must market the idea of problem resolution to employees ,  not just to customers 


-  This involves many of the ideas we have already covered in the article ,  for example ,  setting and rein forcing problem-resolution standards ,  and giving employees the freedom to truly solve customer problems 


-  It is no fun trying to solve customer problems if doing so produces  small mountain of red tape or  sneer from  supervisor 


-  ,  Service employees need specific training about how to deal with angry customers and how to help customers solve service problems 


-  In some cases ,  they need access to information systems that will tell them more about the customer ,  the situation causing the problem ,  and possible solutions 


-  ,  When American Express card holders telephone the 800 number on their monthly statement ,  they talk to  highly trained customer service representative with the authority to solve on the spot 85 percent of the problems that prompt telephone calls 


-  Over the years ,  American Express has made  huge investment in problem-resolution staffing ,  training ,  and technology ,  and as  result few ,  if any ,   


-  ,  Specifics aside ,  problem-resolution excellence requires that managers view services marketing as  way of cementing customer loyalty through service and trust ,  rather than only as  way to acquire new customers 


-  Effective services marketingand its cornerstone ,  service qualityrequires that managers take the long view 


-  But these are the exceptional stories; in most companies ,  quality service is still  soft idea ,  an elusive goal ,  or  low priority 


-  ,  Our objective in this article has been to frame an agenda for improving service that will strip away softness and elusiveness ,  and help galvanize management commitment 


-  The five service-improvement imperatives described here apply whether  company is small or large ,  new or old ,   pure service organization or  manufacturer that supplies product-support service 


-  It is hard to imagine any service company faring well in the ultracompetitive decade ahead if its service is suspect 


-  The service issue is inextricably linked to the issues of craftsmanship ,  integrity ,  generosity ,  


-  We have  new decade ahead of us 


-  What we need now is the will to set our sights higher ,  provide genuine leadership ,  and do what it takes to transform potential into achievement 


-  We have completed three major phases of our research ,  the findings of which form the basis for this article 


-  ,  Phase  was an extensive qualitative study of service customers and executives in four service sectors: appliance repair ,  credit cards ,  retail banking ,  and securities brokerage 


-  In each sector ,  we conducted customer focus-group interviews and in-depth executive interviews on issues pertaining to service quality 


-  Phase  resulted in our developing  conceptual model mat defines service quality from the customers standpoint ,  identifies the criteria customers use to judge quality ,  and outlines potential organizational shortfalls that can cause poor service 


-  ,  Phase II involved an empirical study that focused on the customer side of our service quality model 


-  In this phase ,  we surveyed nearly one thousand customers in the credit card ,  long-distance telephone ,  product repair ,  and retail banking sectors 


-  On the basis of these empirical findings ,  we consolidated the criteria customers use to evaluate service quality into five dimensions: tangibles ,  reliability ,  responsiveness ,  assurance ,  and empathy 


-  We also developed and refined SERVQUAL ,   methodology for measuring customers perceptions of service quality 


-  We selected three of the banks regions  ( each of which had at least twelve branches )  and interviewed managers and employees from these regions individually and in focus groups 


-  We also did  survey of bank customers 


-  ,  In Phase III ,  we focused on the service provider half of our model ,  building on what we learned about internal shortfalls from Phase  and the case study from Phase II 


-  This study involved mail surveys of customers ,  contact personnel ,  and managers in eighty-nine separate field offices of five national service companies two banks ,  two insurance firms ,  and  telephone company 


-  In all ,   , 936 customers ,  728 contact personnel ,  and 231 managers responded to our Phase III questionnaires
