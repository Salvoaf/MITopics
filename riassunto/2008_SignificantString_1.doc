- Trying  with difficulty  to shake up  staid industry? It could be that you arent thinking small enough 


-  Joe Fox ,  who has founded two industry-changing companies with his older brother ,  Avi ,  is  big believer in mini-innovations ,  small insights that add up to  big disruption 


-  Their first company ,   pioneering online brokerage called Web Street ,  was acquired by E-Trade Group for about $50 million in 2001 


-  Last year they started Iggys House Realty ,   subsidiary of Iggys House Inc 


-  that allows sellers to list their homes for free in multiple listings services and on Realtor 


-  Here Fox talks with Josh Hyatt for the MIT Sloan Management Review about how he became  toppler of traditions  and where he is likely to strike next 


-  ,  FOX:  really believe you cant force innovation; its not something that happens in  vacuum 


-  You have to observe the world with  fresh eye 


-  In the 1990s my brother and  were trading stocks on our own ,  and there was  company that had announced it was going public at $16  share; the night before we said ,  Lets buy  number of shares at no more than $20  share after it opens 


- 50 ,  sits there for 10 minutes ,  then immediately runs to $26 before it closes 


-  We waited for five hours for our broker to tell us whether we got in below the $20 per share limit that we set 


-  And we did  which was great because the stock moved to $32  share the next day 


-  We kept thinking about that five hours and we thought ,  There has got to be  better way and within the next year or two we saw what was going on with the Internet 


-  That convinced us there has to be  way to reduce the cost of the transaction ,  create efficiencies and have  greater level of information 


-  If  am going to innovate ,   like to start with the desired result ,  that base idea 


-   keep asking ,  what else could we do to be different  and better? ,  Thats when  look for mini-innovations  smaller steps that will get us there ,  like giving away free NASDAQ trades at Web Street ,  which is what we did 


-  These ideas are not just from me ,  but from my whole team 


-  Im not the end-all of ideas 


-  ,  FOX: You have to be willing to spend the time to do the research and to investigate 


-  Before we started Web Street ,  we saw that all of the information the stockbrokers had in the morning was from the night before  all the trades ,  the buys and the sells 


-  In the morning ,  theyd tell their customers ,  This is how much you have and how much buying power youve got ,  and you used that same number throughout the day 


-  It worked ,  because you would talk to your broker and say ,  Buy  , 000 shares of IBM 


-  If you were short ,  you would mail in  check the old-fashioned way 


- 95  trade  as we wanted to do  you dont want there to be any potential extra cash needed 


-  ,  FOX: You know what  lot of people do? They say to themselves ,  if it could have been changed ,  it would have been changed 


-   dont come from real estate and  dont come from  brokerage house  and sometimes its better to come from outside of the industry 


-  You know theres an opportunity there if people tell you they would use your service 


-  This isnt about nuclear science; its about obvious needs 


-  You know you are on to something successful when somebody says ,  Why didnt  think of that? If you split the atom ,  the next guy isnt going to wonder why he didnt think of that 


-  ,  FOX:  get more fueled and more excited by people saying that they love the concept and that it makes sense to them 


-  With BuySide and ,  later ,  Iggys House ,  people said ,  But how are you going to beat the National Association of Realtors? Let me solve that problem ,   told them 


-  As long as you ,  an intelligent person ,  believe that  consumer would use  service like this  which is where  am going to make my money  then Ill find the answers 


-   want to make real-time information available 


-  Can you give us the formulas for real-time balances ,  buying power and margin buying power?  wanted us to calculate intraday ,  after every transaction ,  how much buying power you have left ,  what your balances are ,  how much money youve made and how much youve lost 


-  Wouldnt you want to know your balance in real time and how many more times you can trade? Of course you would 


-  It was built into the system 25 years ago ,  and you just cant get that data in real time 


-  When we launched in July 1997 ,  we immediately started getting customers 


-  We told customers not to worry ,  that wed eat the trade 


-  We changed the formula ,  and there were even more margin calls 


-  Its an expensive way to learn 


-  That meant that through trial and error ,  we figured out how to supply real-time account information when no one else had it 


-  Of course ,   year later the exchanges figured it out 


-  There were five online firms at the time; there were  couple of thousand online accounts 


-   started going out to raise money and nobody wanted to give me any 


-  So by the time we raised  couple of million  all from individuals ,  40 of them  and got out there in July 1997 ,  there were 12 online brokers ,  but still only  million accounts 


-  The difference in just  year was like seven years in the traditional world 


-  We spent $30 million in marketing over three years; other companies were spending that in  year 


-  But  knew it was  real business; it just seemed like common sense to me 


-  Who was going to believe us? What have we done? Have we ever run an industry-changing company before? It was tough 


-  ,  FOX: We knew we had to keep thinking about what could make us  little different ,  especially since we didnt have the money to spend on marketing 


-  One day ,   was driving and thinking: What would absolutely get people to want to use our services? Well ,  we could offer free trades 


-  It occurred to me that if we could lower our transaction costs ,  we could make money from free trades 


-  Sometimes little insights can look like real innovations 


-  We were paying $25 to make  trade ,  and the market-makers were giving us  rebate of  penny per share 


-  cents  share ,  they said 


-  So on  , 000 shares ,   would receive $25 


-  This meant that our customers could make  trade of  , 000 shares or more on NASDAQ  which is where most of the activity was  and pay nothing ,  while we made money 


-  Our business took off in months 


-  We were brainstorming all the time 


-  Two years into it ,  my brother  who is more of  traditional guy  made  comment about how he sometimes wants to touch and feel his money ,  to have somebody explain  new platform or which mutual fund is  better investment 


-  That got us to thinking about what services we could offer in  brick-and-mortar setting 


-  So we became  virtual online company with  branch office in Beverly Hills 


-  It shocked people ,  but it turned out to be one of the best things we did 


-  We opened four of them ,  and they became our second-best customer-acquisition tool 


-  At that time ,  everything was going online; you were going to be able to get your teeth fixed online ,  the way people were talking 


-  People laughed at us ,  and some of our shareholders didnt understand 


-  But my brother was able to think it through logically ,  and from his clear-headed perspective ,  it was the right move 


-  It made sense that people would feel better even if they just drove by our sign ,  or just knew it was there 


-  When people feel more comfortable ,  they put more money in  and we make more money on that money 


-  Of course ,  they are all E-Trade offices today 


-  Actually ,  there are some ideas  still believe in that we never got to try at Web Street because the market changed on us 


-  You can have the greatest idea in the world ,  but if the market turns against you then the best thing is not to fight the trend 


-  They needed the investment community to think of them as the roll-up player 


-  ,  FOX: My brother and  owned  little less than half of the company when we sold it 


-  If we had been able to build the company more quickly ,  it would have been  greater opportunity  in the billions 


-  ,  FOX: We werent looking to start another company or to change another industry 


-  There was time in between when  sat down and tried to think of what  could do ,  and out came nothing 


-   had some time on my hands ,  and  few bucks ,  and you know what happened? Nothing 


-  Absolutely nothing 


-  You could create efficiencies and find all kinds of processes that you might be able to improve upon ,  but you are not going to innovate 


-  What  saw in the real estate industry was  basic injustice ,  and  began questioning the establishment 


-  That led us to start BuySide in 2006 and then IggysHouse 


-  ,  FOX: We took  risk 


-  You cant let  little thing like the perfect storm of market gyrations stop you ,  it just slows you down 


-   can gain  ton of share even if the market is stagnant ,  as long as we keep adding things 


-  ,  FOX: Im not the end-all in terms of coming up with ideas 


-  When  was looking for an outside lawyer ,   used to hear all the time ,  Joe ,  you cant do that 


-  And then  found one who said ,  Joe ,  that has never been done before ,  but lets see how we can make it happen 


-   have the support  need to figure out how we can make ideas work 


-  ,  FOX: My brother and  were in Santa Monica three years ago looking for  vacation house 


-  We couldnt help but think something was wrong with this picture; we were going to do all of the work ,  and the agent was going to make all of this money 


-  Instead of saying to ourselves ,  Hey ,  thats the way it is ,  we said there has to be  better way and we moved forward from there 


-  People were finding homes and agents were making the money 


-  ,  FOX:  love the creative part ,  but youve got to make money for your investors 


-  ,  FOX: In April 2005 ,   called Joe Barr ,  who had been my president and CFO at Web Street ,  and  said ,  I think weve got something even bigger this time ,  and were doing it 


-   week later ,  we started Buy-Side 


-  OK ,   said ,  so if you found  home and there was  company that could service the transaction once you found it ,  and rebated three-quarters of the buyers agents commission to you ,  would you use  service like that? The response ,  100% of the time ,  was yes 


-  ,  FOX: The people  bring in 


-  They cant just say ,  Oh ,   like the idea 


-  When people say ,  Joe ,   love the idea and Im willing to work unpaid until weve got what it takes to raise money  thats when  know  have believers on my hands 


-  When somebody says ,  My wife had an idea about this ,   have confirmation that these people really believe in it 


-   want everybody to share their ideas ,  and  make sure they know that 


-  ,  FOX: There are ways of doing it 


-  Everyone submitted mission statements based on what they thought we should be all about ,  and they were all somewhat similar: people believed we were changing the industry ,  or helping consumers by putting cash back in their pockets 


-  That opened up everyones thinking ,  and gave us something to talk about 


-  Everybody gets on the speakerphone at the same time  from San Diego ,  Miami ,  Chicago ,  and Texas 


-  ,  FOX:  ask people to read about the industry ,  stories about innovative companies in the online real-estate space like Zillow and Trulia 


-  What are the next things we should be focusing on? What stumbling blocks are ahead? Not everybody will be fired up ,  some people will be naysayers 


-  Sometimes you are so deep in an industry ,  and have been doing it for so long ,  that you cant imagine it being changed even more than we have already changed it 


-  ,  FOX:  always use  pad of paper to lay out my five-year vision 


-  With Web Street ,   sketched the concept by drawing  computer screen  what youll see on it ,  what advantages it will offer consumers ,  and the different levels of service well provide 


-  Id show them what it would look like three years from now ,  then five years from now 


-  You have to know your product ,  what the industry is all about and what you are going to do 


-  ,  FOX: Were all about improving efficiency by using whats out there 


-  In fact ,   went to five different colleges ,  and never graduated 


-  My real estate agents are salaried and will each do at least 15 transactions  month; from their desks ,  theyll help with the negotiation ,  the pricing ,  the contracts ,  and everything all the way to the closing 


-  We can give you three-quarters of our commission back ,  and well still make money 


-  ,  FOX: We were  couple of months into BuySide and into the rebating ,  and  saw that we were going to need to spend  lot of money on marketing ,  just to educate the consumer 


-   thought there had to be  lower-cost way 


-  If youre selling  home ,  theres an 80% chance youll be buying one ,  too 


-  Wouldnt it be wonderful ,   thought ,  if we could acquire customers by offering them free access to the listings services?  figured that would be too expensive ,  but one day  asked one of my managing brokers and she told me that it is all included in our $100  quarter we pay in dues and we could list as many homes as we wanted 


-  Weve done about  , 000 free MLS listings ,  and we havent spent any money on advertising 


-  And we keep adding services  weve got an innovative referral program where traditional agents pay us for leads that turn into transactions 


-  We just launched  mortgage brokerage in  couple of states; my loan officers are salaried ,  and their bonus depends on how well customers feel they were treated 


-  ,  FOX: You cant change an industry if you dont have  large footprint 


-  My mother was working three jobs to support us ,  so my brother and  spent  lot of time talking with the guy 


-  Thirty years later ,  were trying to come up with  company name and my brother says: Theres something about Iggy 


-   loved it right away
