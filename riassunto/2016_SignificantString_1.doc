-  ,  King and Baatartogtokhs article attracted the attention of  number of media outlets  and generated  number of interesting responses 


-  Zuckerman of the MIT Sloan School of Management ,  explores an intriguing question: What if the most important aspects of the theory of disruptive innovation are something different from what its proponents  and its detractors  emphasize? Finally ,  in an article on page 83 ,  Joshua  


-  ,  By Juan Pablo Vzquez Sampere ,  Every time  hear about  new study on disruptive innovation ,   feel excited about the possibility that someone will come up with  way to explain the theory in  much clearer and more transparent manner 


-  ,  For starters ,  King and Baatartogtokh argued that Clayton  


-  ,  Whats more ,  the authors surveyed only 79 experts to evaluate 77 industries 


-  As  result ,  some of the conclusions attributed to the experts are questionable  such as one experts argument that it was unreasonable to assume that wood-products companies could respond to disruption from plastics ,  since the capabilities required were different 


-  If incumbents can increase their profitability by introducing  particular product or technology ,  they often find  way 


-  That statistic may not be meaningful for several reasons 


-  ( In other industries ,  such as minicomputers when they were disrupted by personal computers ,  things can happen relatively fast ,  which makes it easier to see the entire picture of how the industry evolves 


-  )  Second ,  the disruption might affect only one business unit of the incumbent ,  so in some cases ,  the entire company survives even though that particular unit is no longer successful 


-  For all of these reasons ,   long period of coexistence between incumbents and disrupters does not necessarily mean that the process of disruption has halted 


-  It is vital to help boards detect and understand their companies problems when those problems can still be solved outside bankruptcy  and when the companies can still grow profits for shareholders 


-  ,  In my experience ,  the cause of business distress that is most detectable ,  but often undetected or disregarded until material damage is done ,  is  disruptive innovation as defined by Harvard Business School professor Clayton  


-  In his theory of disruptive innovation ,  Christensen has explained how and why industry-leading companies that pay attention to their best customers and improve products for them are susceptible to failure stemming from competitors products or services that are initially inferior and only attract  different market or the lower end of the leading companys market 


-  King and Baljir Baatartogtokh acknowledge that Christensens disruptive innovation theory has gripped the business consciousness like few other ideas 


-  But they incorrectly conclude that the theory simply provides  useful reminder of the importance of testing assumptions ,  seeking outside information ,  and other means of reducing myopic thinking 


-  But ,  for seemingly valid business reasons ,  they declined to do so 


-  ,  It is critical that boards of directors and senior management understand when following accepted principles of good management  ( such as paying attention to your best customers and focusing investments where you can increase profit margins )  leads to failure 


-  The first test is to ask whether an idea or product will appeal to  large population of potential users who have gone without it or who have had to go to an inconvenient location to use it 


-  ,  The second test is to ask whether there are already customers at the low end of the market who would purchase an inferior ,  but still sufficient ,  product at  discount price that would enable  disrupter to earn  sufficient profit 


-  Finally ,  if either or both of the first two tests are passed ,  the final question is whether the disruptive idea is disruptive to all significant incumbent companies in the industry 


-  He explained that disruptive products often improve and displace the incumbents products because the organizational cultures of incumbents usually cause them to avoid inferior products offering lower profit margins ,  which initially do not appeal to their best customers 


-  This explains the problems and declines of countless once-successful companies  and is detectable and avoidable 


-  ,  Christensen has done what businesspeople wish all advisors would do 


-  He extracted from his research  key reason why so many dominant companies fall 


-  He explained it in understandable and compelling terms 


-  Indeed ,  every board of directors anxious to carry out its fiduciary duties of care and loyalty wants to understand what makes successful companies lose dominance or fail 


-  When we consider any management theory or framework ,  it is useful to start by asking  few basic questions: ,  Lets consider the theory of disruptive innovation through the lens of those three questions 


-  ,  Christensens theory of disruptive innovation is animated by an excellent question: ,  Regardless of what one thinks of the theory of disruptive innovations answer to this question ,  the question remains  good one 


-   chief weakness of her critique ,  however ,  was that she did not adequately acknowledge the importance of the question that the theory of disruptive innovation addresses 


-   suspect this comes in part from the fact that Lepore is an outsider to the business field 


-  She does not have to confront the question of why capable ,  motivated incumbent companies might be vulnerable 


-  ,  One of the downsides of the great popularity of the theory of disruptive innovation is that that popularity has obscured the fact that there are other good answers to the question the theory addresses 


-  In particular ,  two compelling answers to the question of why incumbents are vulnerable are competency traps  (  phrase that was introduced by Barbara Levitt and James  


-  March in 1988 and that describes the paradoxical fact that it is more difficult for companies that are highly capable in one area or with one approach to develop new capabilities than it is for  new entrant to do so )  and internal competition  ( that  companys units have difficulty sharing common resources such as their brand and sales channels when the units compete for the same business )  


-  But one does not need the theory of disruptive innovation to appreciate these points of incumbent vulnerability 


-  The question is whether the theory has  distinctive insight to add to complement existing insights 


-  Are incumbents vulnerable even when they do not fall prey to competency traps and are not riven by politics? Christensen and colleagues counsel that the answer is yes 


-  But how and why is that? ,  Here is where things become fuzzy 


-  In their article in the fall 2015 issue of MIT Sloan Management Review ,  King and Baatartogtokh argue that one key claim of the theory of disruptive innovation is that incumbents  ( precisely because they are so competent and motivated )  overshoot customer requirements 


-  My question is: ,   related question can be asked about high-end disruption 


-  Since the earliest formulations of the theory of disruptive innovation ,  Christensen has been adamant that disruption can only come from below  in other words ,  beginning with customers that have zero or low willingness to pay for the dominant technology 


-  Christensens premise seems to be the following: Since customers with low willingness to pay are the most dissatisfied with the existing technology ,  those with high willingness to pay will be most satisfied with current technology ,  and so incumbents who are capable and motivated to serve them are less vulnerable to losing those customers 


-  The problem ,  however ,  is that those with high willingness to pay might be willing to pay even more if incumbents were willing or able to deliver products that better met their needs 


-  Schmidt now indicates that incumbents can often be displaced from above  in other words ,  by entrants that begin by attacking customers with  high willingness to pay 


-  ( Schmidt and van der Rhee explained the practical implications of that research in  2014 MIT Sloan Management Review article 


-  But the question  ask about Christensens insistence that disruption can only come from the low end is the same one  raised with respect to overshooting: ,  Put differently ,  what really is the core idea of the theory of disruptive innovation? ,  My own view is that the core insight of the theory of disruptive innovation can be captured  without requiring us to assume that disruptions always entail customer overshoot by incumbents and must always start with low-end customers  when we relabel it the theory of the unexpectedly bridgeable chasm 


-  Moores core insight was that new technologies often fail to parlay their popularity among early adopters into mass-market appeal; the reason is that ,  since mass-market customers typically have different needs and desires ,  early adopters serve as negative reference points 


-  Moore argued that niches are often very hard to use as springboards for crossing the chasm to the mass market 


-  Christensen argued the opposite  that such springboarding happens more often than we might expect 


-  Incumbents generally assume that innovations appealing to  niche will never threaten them because their customers have different needs ,  but surprise ,  surprise  sometimes those customers change their minds 


-  ,  If disruption is viewed in this broader way as  theory of unexpectedly bridgeable chasms ,  how is it that chasms that seem unbridgeable may be bridged? There are at least three well-known processes of bridging chasms by increasing returns  experience curves ,  network effects ,  and demand discovery  whose shape cannot be known until one starts to embark upon them 


-  The first of these processes is the idea made prominent by the Boston Consulting Group in the 1960s and 1970s  the idea that the more that one engages in  ( or invests in )   production process ,  the better one gets at it 


-  The second of these is the idea that became widely known with the rise of Microsoft in the 1980s  that demand is often driven by the number of other users that use  platform either directly or indirectly ,  causing markets to quickly tip from one platform to another 


-  And the third is the very straightforward point  ( exploited to the hilt by Steve Jobs )  that people often do not know what they like until they see it 


-  But when one or more of these processes is salient ,  surprises can happen because no one can say in advance what particular shape these processes will take 


-  ,   second key question is why ,  in this broader view of the theory ,  incumbents are more vulnerable to such surprises than entrants 


-  Here Christensen points to an important factor  that incumbents face  higher hurdle rate  ( in other words ,  expected rate of return above which they will invest )  for investments in nascent markets than entrants 


-  One reason for this applies to public companies: Pressure to maintain their current valuation multiple can dissuade them from pursuing opportunities in small ,  emerging new markets that appear to promise  lower multiple 


-  Another reason ,  which draws on recent work in economic sociology ,  is that investment in  different niche can signal lower commitment to existing stakeholders  ( customers ,  employees ,  and investors )  


-  In short ,  it is quite instructive to recognize that niches can potentially be the launching pads for ventures that unexpectedly come to compete successfully with the most capable ,  motivated incumbent companies 


-  It is just one part of  larger set of ideas we have for understanding the vulnerability of incumbent companies 


-  One hopes that in the future ,  the theory of disruptive innovation is recognized for what it is rather than promoted or attacked for what it is not 


-  It is only through such judicious use and thoughtful revision that ideas become most valuable for clarifying thinking and action
