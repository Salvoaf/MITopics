-  ,  When Jonas Samuelson became CEO of Stockholm-based home appliance maker Electrolux in 2016 ,  he wanted to reignite innovation and growth by building  faster ,  more digital-ready organizational culture 


-  Consumer electronics and appliances giant Haier has spent years transforming its culture in pursuit of greater speed and innovation while maintaining the efficiency and stability of its traditional manufacturing and logistics processes 


-  How can  company become more agile and innovative without alienating its best employees or wrecking the best of its existing practices? And what does it mean to have  digital-ready culture? ,  Weve been studying these questions for the past three years 


-  The process begins with understanding the four critical values of digital culture: impact ,  speed ,  openness ,  and autonomy 


-  Whats more ,  leaders need to understand  companys prevailing culture before seeking to modernize it 


-  ,  Its equally important that legacy leaders understand exactly which digital values and practices they hope to embrace 


-  The company is radically and uncomfortably transparent and asks employees to be unreasonably selective about our peers 


-  ,  Microsoft has redefined its culture around fostering  growth mindset in both individuals and groups 


-  We then conducted  survey of more than 500 digital and traditional companies to validate the culture framework and assess how the various elements of digital culture correlate with different types of self-reported performance 


-  Speed helps companies stay ahead of competitors and keep up with rapidly changing customer desires 


-  Together ,  these values can foster an engaged ,  empowered workforce where employees feel  personal responsibility to constantly change the company  and often the world 


-  This system of interrelated values and digitally enabled practices can be remarkably effective when management gets it right 


-  While some digital natives might deride this combination as stodgy and bureaucratic ,  not all traditional practices need to be eliminated in the quest for digital culture 


-  In fact ,  it becomes clearer every day that stability and integrity are qualities to be prized 


-  ,  Amazon ,  for example ,  was seen historically as cultivating  high-pressure and argumentative work environment ,  believing that only the fittest should survive for the long run 


-  Google ,  too ,  realized that more stability for employees can benefit the companys stability; after internal analytics showed that new mothers were leaving at higher rates than other employees ,  it boosted family leave policies ,  reduced on-call demands ,  and achieved  50% reduction in attrition among these employees 


-  ,  As for integrity ,   series of headlines over the past few years has made clear that some digital-native companies need to become more principled 


-  In fact ,  our research on more than 500 digital and traditional companies shows that striving for integrity and stability in  companys culture does not hurt self-reported measures of innovation ,  profitability ,  and customer satisfaction 


-  These practices may feel alien to companies whose structures ,  values ,  and governance rules were designed for cautious stability 


-  Yet our analysis shows that rapid experimentation and self-organizing strongly drive measures of self-reported performance ,  including growth and innovation 


-  Moreover ,  organizations cant experiment effectively without the data to measure change 


-  Your customers ,  employees ,  regulators ,  and shareholders deeply appreciate these qualities and the practices that support them 


-  Asking customers about their needs must be supplemented by anticipating customer desires and proactively experimenting to delight the customer 


-  DBS also needed to foster  digital culture ,  improving its innovativeness without alienating its best customers or risking regulatory lapses 


-  They visited major digital players globally to understand their corporate cultures and then defined  set of values and practices to change the DBS culture 


-  They wanted the existing customer focus to become  data-driven customer obsession 


-  For instance ,  by modeling demand in its ATM network ,  which ,  the company says ,  handled more transactions per month than any other bank in the world ,  DBS ensured that its ATMs never ran out of cash 


-  Experiential learning opportunities such as hackathons ,  job shadowing ,  and immersion experiences helped employees gain greater understanding of DBS itself 


-  It rapidly launches digital innovations to meet  variety of voiced or unvoiced customer needs 


-  People in digital startups tend to have  sense of purpose that goes far beyond the walls of the office and motivates them to work hard and innovate 


-  Nike doesnt just try to sell shoes; it wants to be part of its customers lives 


-  It wants to be part of the conversation around any sport ,  any time ,  in any channel 


-  Nike knows how to sell shoes 


-  But by promoting  richer conversation around sports ,  Nike gets closer to sports fans  its customers  by making them feel they are part of  community 


-  Other B2B companies are linking their work to end customers; employees feel more connected when they serve humans instead of companies 


-  At the office ,  apartment ,  or mall ,  Schindler aims to improve customer experience by having elevators that arrive when needed ,  provide  smooth and fast ride ,  and feature useful media and information 


-  As  leader ,  you must live the change you want from your company 


-  Engage in open conversations so that employees can comfortably express their hopes ,  doubts ,  and fears about what might be lost ,  and so that unconscious beliefs can come into the open for discussion 


-  For example ,  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella encourages employees to transition from being know-it-alls to being learn-it-alls ,  underlining  new cultural emphasis on learning ,  openness ,  and empathy 


-  Explicitly highlight those arguments that need support from data 


-  When considering  major internal policy change in an area such as performance evaluations or budgeting ,  conduct visible pilots and experiments before doing  global rollout 


-  Not every unit of  company needs  digital culture 


-  Start in the unit or region that makes the most sense 


-  Even if you believe you need to revitalize culture company-wide ,  as Microsoft and Electrolux do ,  feel free to pay more attention to some units than to others as you learn what works best in your company 


-  ,  Consider creating  separate unit that can safely experiment with new modes of thinking and acting while staying connected to the rest of the organization 


-  Even if they want to innovate ,  busy people often feel that they dont have time to do so 


-  Whether they practice agility or not ,  great IT leaders understand what gets in the way of innovation and speed and have tools to help 


-  They understand the difficulty of working with spaghetti-like legacy systems and can help you fix them 


-  But if you think your company doesnt ,  then its worth looking more closely to test your assumptions 


-  If they cant ,  you may need to transform your IT unit and its leadership so that it can support the kinds of change you want to see in your company 


-  For example ,  your employees need effective ways to download data safely ,  collaborate smoothly across locations and time zones ,  examine their customers journey in detail ,  or monitor  production process in real time 


-  Is your company as transparent as your favorite digital company? Is it as successful? The answer to the first question shapes the answer to the second 


-  Transparency around output ,  quality ,  and safety helps factory workers collaborate to fix problems and raise productivity 


- 17 Transparency can raise productivity ,  help teams police themselves ,  and build greater understanding and trust across units 


-  Nonetheless ,  it can scare employees if they feel as though theyre under constant surveillance 


-  But ,  in the long run ,  true transparency is possible only with  sustained effort led personally by  companys top leaders that emphasizes the value of performance and innovation while reinforcing trust 


-  People offering simple answers for culture change dont know what they are talking about 


-  It takes constant adjustment to ensure values and practices remain aligned even as the companys competitive demands change 


-  And it takes the commitment of everyone across the company to live by the culture you want to achieve 


-  Instead ,  its  matter of communicating the desired values and then introducing some new practices while fine-tuning others
