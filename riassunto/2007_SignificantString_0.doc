-  Demographic data cannot explain why  man takes  date to  movie on one night but orders in pizza to watch  DVD from Netflix Inc 


-  Rather ,  customers just find themselves needing to get things done 


-  When customers find that they need to get  job done ,  they hire products or services to do the job 


-  This means that marketers need to understand the jobs that arise in customers lives for which their products might be hired 


-  The strike outs of marketing history ,  in contrast ,  generally have been the result of focusing on developing products with better features and functions or of attempting to decipher what the average customer in  demographic wants 


-  The second is to describe the methods that those involved in marketing and new-product development can use to identify the job-based structure of  market 


-  And ,  finally ,  the third is to show how the details of business plans become coherent when innovators understand the job to be done 


-  ,   job is the fundamental problem  customer needs to resolve in  given situation 


-  To illustrate how much clearer the path to successful innovation can be when marketers segment by job ,  consider an example from the fast-food industry ,  where companies historically have segmented their markets along the traditional boundaries of product and customer categories 


-  These early-morning customers almost always were alone ,  they did not buy anything else and they consumed the milkshakes in their cars 


-  ,  The researcher then returned to interview the morning customers as they left the restaurant ,  each with  milkshake in hand ,  and essentially asked  ( but in language that they would understand )  ,  Excuse me ,  but could you please tell me what job you were needing to get done for yourself when you came here to hire that milkshake? Most of them ,  it turned out ,  bought their shakes for similar reasons: They faced  long ,  boring commute and needed something to keep that extra hand busy and to make the commute more interesting 


-  they wanted to consume something now that would stave off hunger until noon 


-  It didnt matter that the milkshake wasnt  particularly healthful food because that wasnt the job it was being hired to do 


-  Marketers who are stuck in the mental trap that equates market size with product categories dont understand who they are competing against from the customers point of view 


-  And yet ,  no company has designed  car that is optimized to do the mobile-office job that these millions of people need it to do 


-  If the job were the unit of analysis for carmakers ,  its easy to see how they could differentiate  family of products in ways that mattered for those who hire  car to be their mobile office 


-  After test-driving model after model ,  many buyers who need to do this job conclude that there is little differentiation across the products in this market 


-  The starting point on such maps of differentiation typically is occupied by products that have only the basic functions that customers need 


-   punishing fact of life on this treadmill is that when once-unique features of an augmented product become commonly expected ,  companies are saddled with the costs of providing those features but cannot sustain premium pricing for offering them 


-  The root reason for this entrapment is the pervasive practice of positioning products in categories that are defined by the properties of products ,  so that better is achieved by copying features and stretching functionality 


-  ,  When  company begins to view market structure by job ,  however ,  it can break away from the traditional treadmill of positioning and differentiate itself on dimensions of performance that are salient to jobs that customers need to get done 


-  One happens in the lives of people who have graduated from their starter home and now need to equip their longer-term residence with furniture they will keep for the rest of their lives 


-  Its in-stock ,  take-it-home-and-assemble-it-yourself kits are seen as valuable features by its customers ,  not as inadequacies that are tolerated in order to get discount pricing because they need furniture now 


-  ,  Sometimes the job  customer needs done is aspirational 


-  The need to feel  certain way  perhaps macho ,  pampered or prestigious  arises in many of our lives on occasion 


-  When we find ourselves needing to do one of these jobs ,  we can hire  branded product  Gucci ,  Louis Vuitton ,  Virgin and so on  the very purpose of which is to provide such experiences 


-  ,  Although most marketers view their competitors as those who make the same category of products ,  this is generally only  small subset of the job candidates that customers consider hiring 


-  Crowded commuters want to pass the time productively 


-  It does not simply compete against the major metropolitan dailies; it competes against conversation with strangers ,  paperback novels ,  iPods ,  mobile phones ,  BlackBerries and boredom 


-  Even as automakers struggle to sustain premium prices for the feature-laden cars they introduce every year ,  customers whose cars are their primary offices show  remarkable willingness to pay very high prices for the services that carmakers arent offering ,  just to help them get this job done 


-  ,  Because segmenting by job clarifies who the other job candidates really are ,  it helps marketers to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each of the products that compete ,  in the customers mind ,  for the job and to derive the attributes and experiences that would be required to do the job perfectly 


-  It requires watching ,  participating ,  writing and thinking 


-  ,  There is  hierarchy that consists of places where researchers who are seeking opportunities to generate new growth might look for jobs that customers need doing 


-  Peter Drucker got it right: The customer rarely buys what the business thinks it sells him 


-  Disruptions take off when nonconsumers are trying to get the job done and simply are constrained from good solutions by the complexity and cost of existing products 


-  If your customer is  business ,  the job it needs to do is generally obvious: Make money 


-  This often isnt as easy as it seems ,  however ,  because most employees in customer companies have  limited ,  local understanding rather than  companywide perspective about how money is made 


-  ,   medical equipment company in Batesville ,  Indiana ,  grew its share of the hospital bed market by figuring out how to understand what drove its customers profitability even more astutely than the customers did 


-  They came from understanding the job  the levers that drive hospitals profitability 


-   question to  person involved in  business-to-business purchasing process is as simple as ,  How did you decide that you were paying an acceptable price for this purchase? and can yield useful insights about the levers that drive the customers profit engine 


-  ,  Marketers seeking to understand the jobs-based structure of individual customer markets must act like investigative reporters who have  set of tools at their disposal that includes surveys ,  interviews ,  observations ,  participation and experimentation 


-  The objective is always to understand the situation ,  not the customer 


-  Some marketers with whom weve discussed this concept have asked ,  How does your notion differ from needs-based segmentation? The difference is the unit of analysis 


-  The problem with focusing on customer needs is that  customer finds herself needing different things at different times 


-  ,  Another reason it is so important to understand the situation that precipitated purchase is that this yields insight not just into the functional dimensions of the job to be done but into the emotional factors as well: fear ,  fatigue or frustration; anxiety or anger; panic ,  pride or pain; and so on 


-  In the middle of the spectrum between knowable and ill-defined are instances in which customers know what jobs they need done ,  but there is no product or service designed to do it yet 


-  Marketers can sometimes identify these compensating behaviors simply by observing the consumer in context 


-  Where else could it be used? Morita had  policy of never relying on quantitative market data to guide new-product development as he led the company between 1950 and 1980 ,  because data doesnt exist for new applications of  technology 


-  When the situation is particularly murky ,  marketers will need to participate in the particular context themselves in order to peel away the compensating behaviors and work-arounds that mask the underlying job needing to be done 


-  Hill-Rom used the technique ofempathic discovery8 to understand how the work of individual nurses affected hospital economics as its market researchers worked as hospital orderlies 


-  The chief executive officer of BIG ,  Mike Collins ,  sensed from his experience that the game wouldnt sell 


-  Instead of sending the inventor away ,  however ,  he asked ,  What caused you to develop this game? The inventor had  ready answer: I have three young children and  demanding job 


-  By the time  get home from work and we finish dinner ,  its  oclock and the kids need to go to bed  but  want to have  fun experience with them 


-  What am  going to do? Set up Monopoly or Risk?  need some fun games that we can set up ,  play and put away in 15 minutes 


-  Though his solution to the job was mediocre ,  the valuable insight was the job itself  something that arises in the lives of millions of busy parents every evening 


-  ,  The intuition that comes from living with the problem is  key reason why many of the most successful software products are developed by people who had been on the user end ,  living with or working around the inadequacies of prior products 


-  In some situations ,  marketers and engineers have  sense that  new technology has the potential to unleash new applications ,  but potential customers cannot even articulate what jobs they might want done if technology were to make it possible 


-  For example ,  in the late 1990s ,  the emerging technology oftelematics presented  number of intriguing potential applications: It conceivably could give drivers maps to their destinations ,  inform them about shops in the area that sold products they might want to buy ,  help police find vehicles in case of theft or accident ,  enable hands-free telephone calling ,  collect and interpret data on engine wear and on and on 


-  Though many automakers were paralyzed by their inability to know exactly what applications and features consumers would want ,  General Motors Corp 


-  After  couple of years of coevolution ,   major job had become clear: I want peace of mind that if something unfortunate happens ,  my loved ones and  will be taken care of 


-  ,  At this point ,  the written and electronic records from the customer interactions described above  be they interviews ,  surveys ,  observation ,  participation or coevolution  need to be distilled into  situation case that describes the situation the customer found herself in when the product was hired or used 


-  ,  Once defined ,  this helps the researchers to understand what other job candidates were considered as potential hires 


-  This defines the real competition in the customers mind 


-  ,  From these can be gleaned the next element of the summary: an assessment of the deficiencies and constraints that future product and service innovations need to alleviate in order to grow the market   collection of help wanted signs posted by customers ,  as it were 


-  This not only provides the agenda for future new-product development projects but also gives  sense for whether competitors can more readily eliminate those constraints 


-  Glaring help wanted signs signal significant opportunity 


-  If there arent significant help wanted signs ,  its  signal that the products of one or more competitors already are doing that job well 


-  ,  Purchased databases and customer questionnaires can be used to segment markets by product and customer characteristics and to define new products with better attributes than existing ones 


-  This understanding can only emerge from techniques like those described above 


- 12 In many of these instances ,  the managers killed underachieving products without ever understanding what their real job potential was 


-  ,  Though our research on this issue is still in process ,  it appears that the precipitating event that allows the winning strategy of an emerging company to coalesce is the clarification of  job that customers need to get done for which its product is being hired 


-  Forensic analyses of new-product failures often reveal that marketers have cobbled these four factors together in inconsistent ways 


-  As the examples below illustrate ,  understanding the products job and its real competitors makes it much easier to get the Four Ps right 


-   purpose brand links customers realization that they need to do  job with  product that was designed to do it 


-  Because each is associated with  clear purpose ,  these brands pop into customers minds when they need to do the jobs that these products and services were optimized to do 


-  The other side guides the companys product designers ,  marketers and advertisers ,  giving them  sense of true north as they develop and market new and improved versions of their products 


-  When the company decided to find out what situations its customers had found themselves in when they decided to hire its scuba classes ,  it realized that many of them were engaged couples planning wedding trips to tropical climes ,  suggesting that the company should be buying mailing lists fromBrides instead ofDive magazine 


-  In about the year 2000 ,  however ,  Kodak executives realized that while some customers hired their cameras for the job of preserving high-quality images for posterity ,   much larger group sought simply to entertain themselves ,  to share fun moments with family and friends 


-  Understanding the job for which the product was meant to be hired allowed Kodak to eschew the expensive improvements that didnt matter in favor of relatively simple ones that did 


- 15 ,  Unless marketers understand what other job candidates theyre competing against from the customers perspective ,  they cannot ensure that the price  the third element of the marketing mix  is right 


-  ,  When marketers have defined the set of experiences in purchase and use that need to be provided in order to do the job perfectly ,  the necessary product placement becomes obvious 


-  This had not been clear to the managers when they had classified the milkshake as simply another item on the menu 


-  When pitted against the job candidates that contained 100% juice ,  the mixture drink simply wasnt qualified; it rarely got hired 


-  In fact ,  marketing guru Ted Levitt taught us 30 years ago that customers dont want  quarter-inch drill 


-  They want  quarter-inch hole!16 If that logic seems compelling ,  then why are product categories and customer categories the default modes of segmentation in nearly all companies?  core reason why marketers in most companies say one thing  ( that they know markets ought to be segmented by job )  and yet do another  ( they segment by product and customer category )  is rooted in the easy availability of the latter sort of data 


- 17 ,  The good news is that when companies understand who they are up against in the mind of the customer ,  they can piece together the real size of the market in which they compete 


-  ,  In our studies of the factors that make innovation  high-risk ,  high-expense proposition ,  we have concluded that working to understand the job to be done is one of the most important ways to limit both risk and expense 


-  Quite possibly ,  the root reason why innovation is so failure-ridden is not that the outcomes are intrinsically unpredictable but rather that some of the fundamental paradigms of marketing that we follow in segmenting markets ,  building brands and understanding customers are broken
