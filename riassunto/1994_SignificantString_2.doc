-  Typically ,  we face these decision problems by identifying alternatives and only then considering objectives or criteria to evaluate them 


-   call this standard problem-solving approach alternative-focused thinking 


-  This manner of thinking ,  which  refer to as value-focused thinking ,  is  way to channel  critical resource  hard thinking  in order to make better decisions 


-  ,  Value-focused thinking is designed to focus the decision maker on the essential activities that must occur prior to solving  decision problem 


-  The central role of thinking about values is illustrated in Figure  


-  Value-focused thinking helps uncover hidden objectives and leads to more productive information collection 


-  ,  The greatest benefits of value-focused thinking are being able to generate better alternatives for any decision problem and being able to identify decision situations that are more appealing than the decision problems that confront you 


-  ,  Strategic thinkers have long recognized the need to clarify values 


-  They provide guidelines for organizational behavior and decision making ,  but they cannot be used to evaluate important decisions 


-  Values ,  sometimes embedded in mission statements and goals ,  need to be made more explicit for evaluation 


-  They should be clarified with  specific statement of objectives 


-  However ,  identifying and structuring objectives is  difficult task: although most experts on decision making say that it is crucial to list your objectives ,  they do not clearly address how to go about it or how to use the objectives to guide your thinking 


-  ,  Value-focused thinking includes  process for identifying objectives 


-  In these discussions ,   number of techniques can be used to stimulate creativity in identifying possible objectives  ( see Table  )  


-  It is much easier to recognize redundant objectives when they are explicitly listed than it is to identify missing objectives 


-  ,  The initial list of objectives will contain many items that are not really objectives 


-  It will include alternatives ,  constraints ,  and criteria to evaluate alternatives 


-  With some thought ,  each item on the list can be converted into an objective 


-  What is an objective?  define it as  statement of something that one wants to strive toward 


-  An objective is characterized by three features:  decision context ,  an object ,  and  direction of preference 


-  For example ,  one objective of  forest products company is to minimize environmental impacts 


-  ,  But simply listing objectives is shallow 


-  We need greater depth ,   clear structure ,  and  sound conceptual basis for relating objectives to each other in decision contexts 


-  For this ,   distinguish between fundamental objectives and means objectives 


-  Fundamental objectives concern the ends that decision makers value in  specific decision context; means objectives are methods to achieve ends 


-  Fundamental objectives for strategic decisions ,  the broadest class of decisions facing an organization ,  are strategic objectives 


-  The strategic objectives provide common guidance for all decisions in an organization and form the basis for more detailed fundamental objectives appropriate for specific decisions 


-  ,  To separate means objectives from fundamental objectives and to establish their relationships ,  we use the Why Is That Important?  ( WITI )  test 


-  For each identified objective ,  ask ,  Why is that important? Two types of answers seem possible 


-  One answer is that the objective is one of the essential reasons for interest in the situation 


-  Such an objective is  fundamental objective 


-  The other response is that the objective is important only because of its implications for some other objective 


-  In this case ,  it is  means objective ,  and the response to the question identifies another objective 


-  Apply the WITI test to this objective in turn to ascertain whether it is  means objective or  fundamental objective 


-  Repeatedly identifying ends objectives from means objectives should progressively identify more fundamental values and lead to at least one fundamental objective in  given decision situation 


-  One objective may be to minimize the distance the material is transported by trucks 


-  Why is that objective important? Because shorter distances would reduce the chances of accidents and transportation costs 


-  Again ,  for each objective concerning traffic accidents ,  costs ,  and exposure ,  the question should be asked ,  Why is that important? For accidents ,  the response may be that ,  with fewer accidents ,  there would be fewer highway fatalities and less accidental exposure of the public to the hazardous material 


-  Why is it important to minimize health impacts? It is simply important 


-  When you reach this answer ,  you have found  fundamental objective; minimizing health impacts is  fundamental objective in this decision situation 


-  CMI stresses the method of principled negotiation developed at the Harvard Negotiation Project to decide negotiation issues on their merits rather than through  haggling process focused on what each side says it will and wont do 


-  ,  The principals at CMI are well aware of the value of making objectives explicit 


-  They recognize that both the process of explicating objectives and the results matter 


-  CMI is also aware of the advantages of having outsiders assist organizations in identifying and structuring objectives 


-  ,  As we began our task ,  Raiffa and  held private discussions with nine principals at CMI to carefully articulate all of their objectives for the firm 


-  To illustrate the type of discussion that occurs in identifying objectives ,  let me describe  small part of my meeting with Elizabeth Gray ,  one of the founding principals 


-  Asked why this matters ,  Gray responded that interesting work improves the contribution to clients and affords greater personal enjoyment 


-   asked her to be more specific ,  and she said that one specific objective was to develop intercorporate alliances in both conceptual and practical terms 


-  Elaborating ,  Gray stated that it was important for CMI to promote principled negotiation as  way to think about important conflicts in our society 


-  ,  In such discussions ,  we uncovered  wide range of objectives not previously made explicit 


-  The process aims to get  list of objectives that are deeper than motherhood and apple pie objectives ,  which everyone can agree to ,  but which provide little strategic guidance 


-  ,  The next two steps were to structure the objectives for each individual and then to integrate them into  common set of objectives for CMI 


-  For each of the principals ,  we used  meansends logic to relate different objectives to each other and then we grouped specific objectives under more general objectives 


-  As  result ,  we had two lists of objectives for each individual:  list of fundamental strategic objectives for CMI and  list of means objectives contributing to the strategic objectives 


-  ,  All of the fundamental concerns identified in the individual interviews were combined into  strategic objectives hierarchy for CMI  ( see Table  )  


-  Since no individual mentioned all of these objectives ,  CMIs strategic objectives were broader than those articulated by individual principals ,  but there was  consensus that these strategic objectives were appropriate for the organization 


-  ,  Each individual mentioned around twenty means objectives in the discussions 


-  Collectively ,  there were more than sixty means objectives that pertained to potential CMI products or activities such as management and marketing 


-  Table  provides  partial list of means objectives in several different areas that contribute to CMI strategic objectives 


-  ,  It is insightful to relate the means objectives to the strategic objectives using the meansends logic referred to above 


-  The interrelationships are illustrated in the network in Figure  ,  where an arrow from one objective to another indicates that achieving the former objective has  major influence on  (  


-  To reduce clutter ,  only the objects of the main objectives are indicated in Figure  


-  The detailed meanings of the strategic and means objectives are found ,  respectively ,  in Tables  and  


-  The strategic objectives and the means objectives are used to generate potential decision opportunities 


-  At CMI ,  we could have organized  meeting of principals to devise the decision opportunities ,  guided by the objectives 


-  Unambiguous and complete statements of strategic objectives and means objectives can be  guide to identifying decision opportunities and creating alternatives that enhance both the likelihood of achieving those objectives and the degree to which the objectives are achieved 


-  We have  tendency in all problem solving to move quickly away from the ill-defined to the well-defined ,  from constraint-free thinking to constrained thinking 


-  We need to feel ,  and perhaps even measure ,  progress toward reaching  solution to  decision problem 


-  Once  few alternatives  or perhaps only one ,  such as the status quo  are on the table ,  they serve to anchor thinking about others 


-  For example ,  if  head-hunter calls to offer you  job in  different city ,  you automatically compare that job to your current job ,  and your thinking is anchored to that comparison 


-  But if you are willing to move to another city ,  there are lots of other jobs and lots of other cities to consider 


-  Both the qualitative objectives and any quantitative statements of values  (  


-  ,  Thinking about how to better achieve fundamental objectives can suggest alternatives 


-  To begin ,  it is useful to focus on one objective and think of alternatives that might be very desirable if that were the only objective 


-  You should then repeat this for every objective 


-  This exercise is likely to generate many alternatives ,  most of which would evaluate rather poorly on some objectives other than the one for which it was invented 


-  ,  The next step is to consider objectives two at  time and try to generate alternatives that would be good for both 


-  The alternatives you create now are likely to be either refinements or combinations of those created using single objectives 


-  Then take three objectives at  time and so on ,  until all objectives are considered together 


-  ,  The means objectives can also stimulate thinking about alternatives 


-  Essentially ,  any alternative that influences one of the means objectives should influence at least some of the associated fundamental objectives 


-  More complicated decision situations will tend to have more means objectives ,  which should suggest more alternatives 


-  Consider  rather simple fundamental objective: to maximize profits from the sale of  product 


-  Means objectives ,  in this case ,  might address sales volume ,  product price ,  manufacturing cost ,  distribution cost ,  and overhead cost 


-  ,   decision makers broadest objectives are the strategic objectives 


-  Sometimes the wide open question of what can be done to contribute to the achievement of each strategic objective is worth pondering 


-  Applying the ideas above to each strategic objective should suggest some worthwhile alternatives 


-  Using the strategic objectives in this way ,  without  decision context ,  is much like identifying decision opportunities 


-  Thus ,  at the end of  decision process ,  when you are about to choose an alternative ,  think about new alternatives once more 


-  Thus ,  carefully search for some new alternative that can better achieve the fundamental objectives by using the same or fewer resources in  different way 


-  Controlling the decision situations that you face may have  greater influence on the achievement of your objectives than does controlling the alternatives selected for the decisions 


-  ,  Decision makers usually think of decision situations as problems to solve ,  not as opportunities to take advantage of 


-  Who needs yet another problem? One of the main ideas of value-focused thinking is that you may need another problem  because  decision problem may not be  problem at all but an opportunity 


-  In this sense ,  recognizing and following up on decision opportunities is analogous to prevention ,  whereas dealing with decision problems is analogous to cure 


-  You use your creative genius ,  which can be stimulated by value-focused thinking ,  to examine whether and how you can better achieve your objectives 


-  ,  An organizations strategic objectives are the foundation from which decision opportunities can be identified 


-  But how many organizations have carefully written down and organized their strategic objectives? In how many organizations do the employees know and understand the organizations strategic objectives? The answer to both questions is very few 


-  The chance to state and clarify these strategic objectives is itself  decision opportunity 


-  ,  The decision maker should develop specific procedures to routinely search through each of the strategic objectives for decision opportunities 


-  To put this procedure into operation ,  the decision maker will have to unambiguously state and structure the strategic objectives 


-  Then ,  each month the decision maker should verify that the strategic objectives are appropriate and make any necessary changes 


-  There should usually be no changes since we are talking about broad ,  high-level objectives 


-  Then ,  the decision maker should use each strategic objective to help think of decision opportunities to do things better 


-  In an important class of such decisions ,  one stakeholder wishes to have  certain alternative selected ,  but  different stakeholder has the power to make the decision 


-  ,  Suppose you are the stakeholder who wants  particular alternative selected by another stakeholder ,  whom  will now refer to as the decision maker 


-  Rather than simply allowing the decision maker to choose an alternative that may not be the one you desire ,  you should create alternatives that modify your desired alternative so that it maintains its essential features for you and is better than the existing alternatives for the decision maker 


-  Indeed ,  she should have little objection to your efforts in this regard ,  as she may end up better off as  result 


-  In this process ,  begin by identifying the negative impacts of your desired alternative relative to the status quo in terms of her values 


-  These impacts probably affect the means objectives 


-  Follow their implications through  means-ends objectives hierarchy to the fundamental objectives of the decision maker 


-  Now you should be able to create modified alternatives that can improve matters in terms of her fundamental objectives while maintaining the key consequences desired by you 


-  It is worth noting that the strategic objectives of  decision maker are likely much broader than the set of fundamental objectives influenced by your desired alternative 


-  Thus ,  an alternative distinct from the original alternative may be used to satisfy her fundamental objectives when used in conjunction with the original alternative 


-  You negotiate for the other side and make sure the decision maker gets enough to be willing to support your desired alternative ,  and you negotiate for your side as well 


-  Also ,  you are trying to balance overall impacts on the decision maker and overall impacts on you in  manner that is prescriptively reasonable to you ,  and that the decision maker will view as descriptively fair and responsible 


-  ,  In addition to CMI ,  value-focused thinking has been applied at several other organizations in different contexts: coordinating decisions in all the functional departments at the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority;8 deciding whether to develop the coal reserves in  pristine rainforest in Sabah ,   Malaysian state in Borneo;9 designing and evaluating wastewater treatment strategies for the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle; and defining strategic objectives for the California Seismic Safety Commission 


-  ,  Clearly ,  value-focused thinking may be useful to organizations as well as individuals 


-  Clarifying and explicitly stating your organizations strategic objectives should have  high benefit-to-effort ratio 


-  Even if your organization has  mission statement and list of organizational goals ,  making these more explicit by writing specific objectives down and organizing them should lead to further clarification 


-  These strategic objectives will not only help you make wiser decisions but ,  more important ,  they should help you recognize and create new decision opportunities 


-  ,  Initially ,  it may be difficult to articulate ,  review ,  and revise your objectives 


-  It may appear that members of management have different concepts of the organizations objectives 


-  If the apparent conflicts are not real ,  the improved understanding is still crucial 


-  You may get the feeling that you are using valuable time and not solving your decision problems when you are just thinking about and structuring your objectives 


-  But thinking about values ,  whether or not you call it an exercise ,  can help with the real decisions you face 


-  ,  As you gain experience ,  thinking about your objectives should get easier and the results should get better 


-  There are three reasons for this 


-  As you sort these out ,  you will have  better understanding of your values ,  which will make it easier to clarify difficult value issues 


-  Third ,  as you continue to structure and understand your values ,  they will begin to form  coherent pattern 


-  The frames of reference you develop over time will facilitate thinking about your values in new contexts 


-  ,  To recapitulate ,  value-focused thinking will help you in three major ways: to recognize and identify decision opportunities ,  to create better alternatives for your decision problems ,  and to develop an enduring set of guiding principles for your organization
