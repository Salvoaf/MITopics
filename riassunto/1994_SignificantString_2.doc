- Several years ago at IBM Credit Corporation ,  arriving at  quote for computer financing involved five business functions and ,  on average ,  took seven days  even though customers and sales representatives were anxiously awaiting the outcome 


-  Now ,  coming up with  quote takes six hours ,  largely because one person handles the entire deal from start to finish 


-  The company issues more than ten times as many quotes as it did in 1985 ,  using  computer for more than half of the quotes 


-  And IBM is beginning to issue quotes in real time on the customer site ,  by combining yet another role with that of doing the deal  selling the computer 


-  IBM account executives have become representatives of IBM Credit 


-  ,  At Pacific Bell ,  providing  business customer with Centrex telephone service once took eleven jobs and more than five business days 


-  Service representatives had to update at least nine computer systems with the correct information ,  making frequent errors and rework ,  and consulting customers several times 


-  Using  computer workstation that interfaces with all nine systems ,  they provide the customers service in no more than  


-  days; if the order is for  type of service predefined in network software  ( as in 80 percent of orders )  ,  it is usually done the day of the order 


-  Order rework is down substantially 


-  ,  The Internal Revenue Services collections division once had  very complex process for collecting taxes from delinquent taxpayers ,  which involved six different functions and much time spent on locating taxpayer files 


-  When the agency built  new computer system for tracking cases ,  the collections and backlog improved dramatically ,  with major reductions in number of employees and offices ,  but worker morale declined and turnover increased 


-  Only when collections teams handled entire cases to completion did collections improve in both productivity and job satisfaction  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  These organizations are taking actions that counter  century of conventional wisdom about how jobs and organizations should be structured 


-  Throughout the industrial age ,  the emphasis has been on seeking efficiencies through the detailed functional specialization of jobs or the so-called functional division of labor 


-  Now ,  however ,  many firms are beginning to move toward combination ,  not division ,  of labor 


-  They are using individuals or small teams to perform  series of tasks ,  such as the fulfillment of  customer order from beginning to end ,  often with the help of information systems that reach through the organization 


-  ,  Some of the firms that have implemented this radical new work design call it  case management approach ,  referring perhaps to social work case managers who help their clients interface with multiple social agencies and bureaucracies 


-  One of the first organizations to affix the case management label to  redesigned process was Mutual Benefit Life ,  an innovative  ( albeit financially troubled )  insurance company in Newark ,  New Jersey 


-  It transformed its process for underwriting and issuing an insurance policy from an operational nightmare  it required forty steps ,  twelve functions ,  eighty jobs ,  and an average of twenty-two days  into  case management process involving one person ,  assisted by two others 


-  Case managers handle each policy from application to issue in two to six days ,  while cutting costs by more than 40 percent 


-  Though the firms real estate portfolio has led it into great difficulty ,  the case management process was functioning well before new business began to decline ,  and many other insurance firms have since adopted the same process 


-  Figure  depicts  simple model of case management in  manufacturing order management process 


-  ,  We have observed new case management structures in more than fifteen firms in  variety of manufacturing and service industries ,  including these: ,  Some of these firms have now had several years of experience with case management; others have created case management roles but are still implementing supporting systems and structures 


-  ,  While case management presents exciting possibilities for process design and execution ,  it is not usually adopted without problems and issues 


-  Furthermore ,  neither of the two approaches to providing information to case managers  implementing  broad ,  integrated new system or providing networked links to old ones  is entirely satisfactory 


-  Finally ,  there are limits to how much job functionality can be incorporated into  case management environment 


-  Before exploring these difficulties ,  however ,  it is important to explain the concept and the promise of this work design 


-  We have observed four components of  successful case managers role: ,  Case management is an appropriate design for work that is performed along process lines rather than in business functions 


-  Case management is particularly useful in processes that deal with customers ,  which involve managing the entire cycle of activities from customer order to product or service delivery ,  billing ,  and payment 


-  The process approach to work ,  which specifies  structured set of activities resulting in  specified output for  specified customer ,  originated in the quality movement 


-  Case management is ,  for most organizations ,   radical departure from current work organization and is usually adopted with objectives of order-of-magnitude gains in time ,  cost ,  or quality 


-  ,  Like other radical process designs ,  case management implies broad processes that cut across the existing functions of the firm 


-  Any process approach is  shift from the functional structures familiar to most firms; case management is particularly distinctive because it achieves cross-functional integration by combining several functions into one job 


-  Not only are they liaisons between these different functions and customers ,  but they actually perform the work previously done by the functions 


-  Moving to case management ,  therefore ,  inevitably involves considerable change in both organizational structure and business processes 


-  The difficulty of such change ,  however ,  reflects the difficulty  customer has with todays highly functionalized ,  segmented organization 


-  As one Dow Chemical executive put it ,  The fact that we are  multifunctional ,  multidivisional ,  multi-SBU organization is not our customers fault 


-  It is seen as  way to provide the customer with faster and more complete service than before ,  with minimal handoffs and the ability to give customers the status of work in process 


-  At Mutual Benefit Life ,  for example ,  the case managers were not only  way to process more efficiently and hence speed up the time to complete  policy ,  but also  way to provide the customer with  broader array of more responsive services 


-  This requires job expansion and making case managers responsible for dealing directly with customer issues ,  instead of having to get approval from senior managers or managers with relevant expertise 


-  When well designed ,  case management makes the back room and the front room indistinguishable 


-  It is  vehicle for literally presenting one face to the customer  long  slogan at many firms ,  but rarely achieved when the product or service is spread among many different departments and workers 


-  ,  Several of these components of case management could have been  and in some cases were  implemented in the past 


-  Though it would have been counter to most prevailing organizational structures ,   firm could have created  closed-loop process and could have given greater decision rights to front-line personnel 


-  Without recently developed ,  powerful ,  and flexible workstations and supporting software tools ,  there would have been no way to pull together all the information necessary to make case management work  unless ,  of course ,  the firm had been oriented to broad processes in building its mainframe system architectures ,  which is very unlikely 


-  Information technology is not necessarily the most important component of case management ,  but it was the most limiting in the past 


-  We know of several banks ,  for example ,  that have constructed integrated customer files ,  allowing tellers or other front-line employees to access customer information across bank products and departments 


-  But because they do not allow users of the customer data to represent all of the banks products ,  little cross-selling or relationship management can occur 


-  ,  Many other firms have implemented roles at the intersection of sales and operations to coordinate order management ,  but without role expansion ,  supporting information technology ,  and decision-making authority ,  these liaison roles are just Band-Aids on an inefficient business process 


-  One high-tech manufacturer we studied created  case managerlike role to handle the order fulfillment process for key accounts 


-  Yet because managers insisted that the role be nonexempt  ( and thus low in status )  ,  the case managers never had access to key information from the functional groups that the role was intended to coordinate 


-  In case management ,  less than all might as well be nothing 


-  ,  Though case management is beginning to seem routine in many firms ,  it is  major departure from the way we have organized work since the Industrial Revolution 


-  For the organizational thinkers of the nineteenth century ,   key aspect of modern organizational life was the division of labor 


-  Adam Smith described the division of labor in the manufacture of pins: ,  In manufacturing ,  experimentation with more complete jobs began many years ago ,  though few firms have had more positive results than with the assembly line 


-  For routine ,  structured tasks ,  whether they involve manufacturing or service processes ,  it is difficult to beat highly specialized jobs and sequential organization for efficiency 


-  There is also evidence that the workers  ( at least in the United States )  who hold these jobs are often reasonably satisfied with them 


-  As one worker in the automobile industry put it ,  If Ive got to bust my ass to be meaningful ,  forget it; Id rather be monotonous 


-  ,  Based on conventional wisdom ,  many service industries as well as service functions also adopted the assembly line model ,  though it rarely worked as well as it did in manufacturing 


-  Jobs were narrowly defined ,  and the problems they addressed required only low levels of expertise ,  leading to monotony and difficulty in assessing  workers contribution 


-  Furthermore ,  assembly line structures did not deal well with tasks that required coordinating many different functions or roles 


-  Each highly segmented role created the need for  buffer  ( in-box and out-box )  and  communications interface ,  which greatly increased the time to complete the service 


-  In an age of speed and time-based competition ,  these delays have become even more problematic 


-  In many insurance firms ,  for example ,  we have found ten-to-one ratios between elapsed time and value-added time in  cross-functional work process 


-  Customers had  way of interfering with the best-laid plans for how work should flow 


-  They called when their applications or policies or orders were in midstream ,  forcing  halt in the flow to find their file 


-  They wanted their orders expedited ,  which slowed down all the others 


-  For all these reasons ,  firms tried to isolate the front-line people from the back-office producers 


-  If organizations want to be responsive to customers ,  they can hardly consider interacting with customers an interruption in their work 


-  In short ,  the assembly line model is not well suited to work problems involving interfunctional coordination and high customer service levels  ( see Table  )  


-  ,  The assembly line model ,  of course ,  is not the only alternative to case management as  form of work organization 


-  For decades ,  firms have also employed cross-functional teams for certain types of tasks 


-  Therefore ,  such permanent teams are not well suited to highly structured tasks 


-  ,   third alternative to case management is the structure based on relatively independent functional experts ,  such as scientists in  research-oriented organization ,  or physicians in  hospital 


-  For the tasks described in Table  ,  the functional expert structure excels only at high-expertise tasks and  ( sometimes )  those involving customer service and interruption 


-  Functional experts are not efficient at permanent task execution ,  particularly of highly structured tasks 


-  Cross-functional coordination is the most difficult problem in such work environments 


-  ,  Viewed in the context of Table  ,  the benefit of case management is its flexibility to handle multiple tasks 


-  The combination of high efficiency at relatively structured tasks ,  coordination across multiple roles ,  use of IS to coordinate the expertise of an entire organization ,  responsiveness to customers ,  and the ability to execute all these tasks permanently is difficult to resist in many different types of businesses 


-  ,  Not only customers but also employees benefit from case management  at least those employees who can fit into these demanding jobs 


-  Case managers can see  task through to completion and gain self-esteem from their employers trust in their ability to make the right decisions and actions 


-  They learn  broad range of processes through the lens of  case management workstation and face  wide variety of issues and challenges 


-  Their jobs are not easy but are always interesting 


-  ,  In general ,  organizations with complex processes for bringing their products and services to market are the best candidates for case management 


-  In manufacturing industries ,  case management is best suited to order management processes requiring frequent and close interaction with customers   


-  ,  when there are many products to choose from ,  when products are configured to  customers specification ,  when scheduling of  customers order is difficult ,  or when services are combined with products 


-  Of course ,  this sort of environment in manufacturing  sometimes called the service factory  is becoming increasingly common 


-  Firms must be careful ,  however ,  not to include too many tasks in the role 


-  ,  At Dell Computer ,  for example ,   recently designed case manager position both takes and executes customer orders and also provides technical support for Dell products 


-  However ,  the reengineering team determined that updating the technical support knowledge base and doing market segmentation were activities that ,  although related to customer support ,  took place in  different time frame and might distract front-line workers from their customer duties 


-  ,  In service industries ,  the most feasible environments for case management are those in which the service cannot be performed simply and straightforwardly in assembly line fashion 


-  ,  as in  health care institution )  


-  These service industry environments might be called service job shops 


-  In an ideal world ,  organizational handoffs in business processes where there is interaction with customers would be transparent to the customer; in the real world ,  however ,  that does not often happen 


-  One consumer goods firm we studied ,  for example ,  had five divisions ,  each with its own order-processing systems ,  selling to the same retail customers 


-  ,  There is  tradeoff ,  however ,  in designing relatively complex case management roles 


-  The broader the set of functional tasks involved and the organizations linked ,  the more difficult it is to find good case managers 


-  One issue is that to service customers directly and to complete or oversee the work for those customers is  difficult combination of activities ,  in terms of both skills and logistics 


-  Few case managers in insurance ,  for example ,  are both expert at underwriting and good at convincing customers to buy policies 


-  The issue of location may also limit the breadth of case management 


-  For example ,  at Pacific Bell ,  the Centrex provisioning process also involves some tasks that require  person to be at  switching center to connect cable pairs 


-  Case managers sitting at  workstation could not handle this job ,  so the company retained the role of facility provisioner 


-  ,  In general ,  while case management is an innovative and attractive design for customer-interacting work processes ,  it raises many issues of implementation and fit with the existing organization 


-  ,  In creating case management environments ,  the firms we studied faced several issues 


-  Managers must deal with such implementation issues as the proximity of the case manager to the customer ,  the decision rights granted to case managers ,  the supporting information architecture ,  the level of monitoring ,  and the choice between individuals and teams as case managers 


-  Case management also has several implications that continue after the role and its activities have been initially established ,  such as for human resource requirements and policies 


-  It is too early in the life of case management to have definitive answers for all these issues 


-  But it is not too early to focus on some of the major problems that must be resolved and point out what can be learned from the experiences of some pioneers in case management 


-  ,  Even though case management is  way to increase customer responsiveness ,  only some case managers deal face to face with customers 


-  Many case management roles thus far established deal with  field salesperson ,   selling agent ,   broker ,  or some other intermediary who deals directly with the customer 


-  Thus case managers are frequently one step removed from the customer ,  though they sometimes have direct contact when they provide customer service 


-  Firms may be reluctant to give sales agents access to the full information that comes with case management particularly when they are not employees but independent agents 


-  Firms also fear that the salespersons incentives may not be closely aligned with their own 


-  For example ,  when we told  mortgage companys chief financial officer that the trends in his industry would eventually lead to  case manager who would issue mortgages in real time at the customer site ,  he responded that his company couldnt tolerate the risk of combining the sales ,  appraisal ,  and loan approval roles 


-  For example ,  Lithonia Lighting ,  the largest manufacturer of lighting fixtures in the United States ,  has designed  system called Light*Link that places all its relevant information in the hands of independent sales agents 


-  Lithonia agents can access  great deal of information about the internal operations of Lithonia such as production scheduling ,  pricing policies ,  and so on 


-  Lithonia has also provided them with  number of expert systems so that they can respond to customer requests for quick lighting designs  for an office building or for  baseball park 


-  ,  Similarly ,  although it created  case management role at headquarters that greatly improved the quote generation process ,  IBM Credit felt that ,  to generate quotes sufficiently rapidly ,  it must move quote generation to the IBM field salesforce 


-  Until IBM develops new compensation schemes based on the long-term profit of  deal ,  these account executives would seem to have every incentive to give away the store to get  customers business 


-  However ,  preliminary results from combining these roles indicate that the salespeople often make deals that are more favorable to IBM Credit than those headquarters was able to arrange 


-   few salespeople have even experimented with giving the workstations to customers and letting them create their own deals 


-  IBM Credit was bold simply because it had to be  it couldnt make the process work quickly enough when it was centralized at headquarters 


-  Furthermore ,  it had  long history of working with the field salesforce to glean information about customers 


-  ,  IBM Credits experience illustrates the full spectrum of proximity to the customer  from isolation to case management by the customer 


-   few other firms we encountered planned eventually to move case management to the customer 


-  At Bell Atlantic ,  for example ,  the case management process involved working with customers to help them select or change long distance carriers 


-  It would probably not work well ,  for example ,  in underwriting insurance or issuing home mortgages ,  where the customers interests may not coincide with those of the insurance or loan provider 


-  ,  Certainly ,  moving case management very close to the customer involves risk 


-  Case managers who both execute and sell may decide ,  for example ,  to take their business elsewhere or to satisfy customers at the firms expense 


-  Though few firms have been as bold as Lithonia and IBM Credit ,  several insurance companies  ( particularly those with captive agents )  and manufacturing firms are hoping that once they can demonstrate case managements success as an intermediary between the firm and its salesforce ,  they will be able to move the role and its capabilities gradually into the field 


-  In some organizations ,  such as direct suppliers like Dell Computer ,  the salesforce is not in the field ,  and customer orders are taken primarily at headquarters 


-  In such cases ,  moving case management close to the customer is the only alternative 


-  ,  Another consideration in designing case management roles is the level of decision-making rights in serving customers 


-  Case management generally implies  high level of autonomy ,  but just how much freedom in making decisions is appropriate? We believe the answer is ,  As much as possible without causing problems elsewhere 


-  An example of case management at Xerox illustrates the tradeoffs in establishing decision rights 


-  ,  Xerox has begun to implement case manager roles in its order management process 


-  The result of the redesign is  consolidation of multiple functions into two roles ,  customer contact employees  ( CCEs )  and customer support employees  ( CSEs )  ,  which together form  case management team  ( or micro-enterprise unit ,  as Xerox calls it )  


-  Using substantial information technology ,  these two roles will oversee the entire process of managing an order ,  from giving the customer  proposal to collecting revenues 


-  ,  The new roles ,  particularly the CCEs ,  have substantial decision-making authority 


-  Xerox created  broad set of decision rights for the roles and then pared away detailed policies and procedures to match the stated rights 


-   number of management levels are eliminated ,  which increases decision-making power 


-  In fact ,  there is only one level of managers above the CCEs ,  and they mentor and advise the CCEs ,  rather than provide close supervision 


-  Customer satisfaction is  primary factor in the CCEs performance evaluations ,  which also support customer-oriented decision making 


-  Case managers have  great deal of pricing flexibility ,  but they cannot offer prices below the government price ,  which must be the lowest possible price by definition 


-  ,  Case managers cannot do their work if they are not empowered to meet customer needs in creative and sometimes unorthodox ways 


- 10 ,  Developing an information architecture to deliver all relevant information to the case managers desk is ,  for many firms ,   herculean task 


-  Since most systems in the past have been built along functional lines   sales system ,   logistics system ,   manufacturing system  creating  customer-focused architecture typically involves building or buying new systems from the ground up 


-  Companies can expect to spend tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars to create such an architecture ,  and it often fails 


-  Several attempts at creating customer-focused architectures for the banking industry ,  such as those by Hogan Systems and Westpac Bank ,  have been abandoned after many years of effort 


-  They are creating frontware or composite systems that pull data from various functional databases  ( or ,  more commonly ,  smaller extracts from those databases )  ,  transmit it across existing corporate networks ,  and integrate it at the case managers workstation 


-  Case managers can then see into the entire firm without  total change of systems 


-  ,  Pacific Bell ,  for example ,  has established an organizational unit to create just this type of system 


-  In the Centrex example described above ,  the Strategic Integrated Systems group developed  front-end system that guided provisioning caseworkers through the steps necessary to handle an order correctly ,  using such databases as equipment inventory ,  customer requirements ,  and installation schedules 


-  Because the underlying databases and network applications are quite complex ,  the front-end system determines what questions to ask the customer and in what order 


-  The system and the case management approach are now operating in several regions of Pacific Bells service area and have substantially reduced both provisioning time and errors 


-  ,  Yet these frontware workstations are no panacea for information systems architectures that are functionally based 


-  First of all ,  aging functional systems may not provide the right kinds of information and may be expensive to modify and maintain 


-  Building frontware systems may relieve pressure to replace them  but the pressure may be  useful source of motivation 


-  Because of concerns about the robustness of the front-ware approach ,  many of the IT managers we have interviewed question this interim approach ,  even in firms where it is supporting case management today 


-  They fear that multiple investments in temporary case management systems will eventually lead to an unmanageable jumble   gridlock of ad hoc systems ,  database extracts ,  and locally managed computers 


-  We believe that most firms should work on both short-term frontware systems and long-term architectures until there is more evidence that the composite approach is viable over the long term 


-  ,  Because the handling of customers and information about the customer interface are typically concentrated in the case managers role ,  issues of monitoring job tasks in case management environments are common 


-  We have seen examples of extremely high and low levels of monitoring that disturbed the corporate culture 


-  ,  At the Internal Revenue Service ,  the activities and performance of the collections agents ,  or case managers ,  were closely monitored and controlled through the computer system supporting the collections process 


-  The computer system made it possible for supervisors to monitor directly the case managers behavior instead of relying on after-the-fact measures of their performance 


-  The system measured the duration of calls ,  time at and away from work ,  dollars recovered per unit of time ,  and many other factors 


-  Also ,  the agency had expended considerable resources on the new computer system and wanted to justify the expenditure with productivity increases 


-  ,  The new process ,  computer system ,  and associated controls were very successful in economic terms 


-  While the efficiency of the process and the dollars collected from it increased markedly ,  so did the agent turnover rate and the dissatisfaction of supervisors 


-  Many employees felt that they were overcontrolled ,  and even supervisors complained about spending too much time on monitoring and control 


-  The agency eventually backed off on the level of monitoring and moved to greater levels of team self-management 


-  Case management teams now do the monitoring 


-  Supervisors can spend more time teaching agents about tax matters and advising teams on how to achieve better performance ,  rather than on individual monitoring 


-  ,  At the other extreme of control  ( albeit for  different reason )  ,   network engineering group in  telecommunications services firm wanted to relax the information controls on its case managers 


-  The group built  workstation for providing new-customer circuits that greatly reduced the cycle time for this process but also bypassed the previous mainframe databases that documented and managed the network 


-  At least to some ,  these systems were necessary for ensuring network integrity 


-  Needless to say ,  the new workstation-based system led to  major political battle that raged for more than  year until the advocate of the workstation-based approach was promoted ,  which assured its adoption 


-  In the meantime ,  the company incorporated some of the original controls into the workstation 


-  ,  For most firms ,  the correct approach to case management monitoring is in the middle of the spectrum ,  but with  bias toward less monitoring and more accountability and responsibility 


-  Since case management always involves information technology ,  and IT is extremely useful for monitoring work ,  most employers need to resist using all the employee performance information available 


-  ,  One somewhat paradoxical aspect of case management is its potential for low job satisfaction 


-  At first blush ,  this seems to be  job that would fulfill even the most challenge-oriented employee 


-  It involves high levels of autonomy and decision-making authority ,  completion of  broad set of tasks ,  and interfaces with many parts of the organization 


-  These are ,  according to theorists of work motivation ,  key aspects of rewarding and enriching jobs 


-  ,  One facet of case management ,  however ,  can radically reduce its work-life quality 


-  The job is mediated through  computer workstation or  telephone ,  so some case managers feel chained to the computer or phone 


-  They feel that they are not doing their jobs if they are not peering at the screen ,  typing at the keyboard ,  or talking on the telephone 


-  Even when the job involves analyzing real customer problems or talking to real customers on the telephone ,  tangible social interaction is lost 


-  Even the tangibility of paper and files is missed; as one case manager put it ,  Instead of putting  completed file into the out-box ,   feel like  am sending it into  black hole 


-  ,  The most common way to address this problem is to create case management teams ,  rather than relying on isolated individuals 


-  When case management requires the combination of highly specialized functional skills ,  teams of specialists can maintain their functional identities and be members of  case management team 


-  At Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers ,  Florida ,  for example ,  case management teams specialize by the types of patient problems they are equipped to treat 


-   particular care center may focus on cardiology or cancer ,  but the patient will receive care from only ten members of  team ,  rather than from the normal range of sixty to one hundred care givers 


- 11 The case management teams we have observed ,  however ,  are working well 


-  Those firms that view teams as only an interim step in case management ,  such as in Bell Atlantics carrier access organization ,  may find that they lose more in job satisfaction than they gain in efficiency when they abandon teams for individual case managers 


-  ,  However ,  one insurance firm we have studied is attempting to create team-based case management without significantly changing structure ,  location ,  or skills 


-  The team will have to access multiple systems in order to complete  case 


-  ,  This environment strains the definition of case management; it is really just  permanent cross-functional team 


-  Though the process for issuing insurance policies may be streamlined ,  we doubt that the order-of-magnitude benefits the firm desires can be achieved 


-  We also question whether  group of individuals without common jobs or location really constitutes  team 


-  ,  There are many human resource issues in case management 


-  The skills ,  compensation ,  performance evaluation criteria ,  and career paths of case managers are normally quite different from those of other employees 


-  Yet because case managers manage cases rather than people ,  they wreak havoc with traditional human resource policies in these areas 


-  ,  At Mutual Benefit Life ,  human resource issues were the most difficult aspects of the shift to case management 


-  Those employees who were capable of becoming case managers faced great uncertainty about how the firm would measure their performance ,  how much they would be compensated ,  and where their careers would lead 


-  The personnel department didnt understand how difficult the case manager role was and how much compensation it should receive 


-  Because the case managers had no subordinates and worked at  computer ,  the department wanted to classify the job as clerical 


-  The team that designed the case manager role had to work long and hard to convince personnel that case managers should be paid not only more than secretaries ,  but also more than underwriters 


-  High-achieving case managers also had initial difficulties with the idea that ,  as they progressed ,  they would not change job titles but would simply deal with more challenging cases 


-  Employees who could not master case management jobs felt betrayed 


-  Few of these employees ,  however well-trained ,  could perform the difficult and broad set of case management tasks 


-  Since the breadth of the job demanded not only trained skills but also high intelligence and  customer-oriented personality ,  only so much of the gap could be addressed through training 


-  Some of the employees picketed the firms headquarters to show their frustration 


-  ,  Many of these problems seemed insurmountable until one executive became the manager of the personnel function and of the information systems function ,  which had been very active in establishing the case manager role 


-  Thereafter ,  the firm implemented new programs to address both short- and long-term issues arising from case management 


-  Xerox and PHH Fleet America have adopted this same organizational combination of systems ,  process ,  and human resource responsibilities; it seems that when technology and processes change ,  so do jobs ,  and it is very helpful to have all of these resources managed under one roof 


-  ,  Though some organizational theorists have suggested that the functional structure will disappear in the process-oriented organization ,  we do not expect that even extensive case management will eliminate functions entirely 


- 12 In the firms we studied ,  case management replaced some functions ,  resulted in shrinkage to  small group of functional experts in others ,  and left some fully intact 


-  Functions were replaced completely when the expertise levels needed to perform the functional tasks were very low 


-  When expertise can be taught to case managers or put into information systems ,  the result is usually an organizational structure that reduces functions in size and power but does not eliminate them 


-  Small groups of functional experts can still perform several valuable functions ,  including training and certifying case managers in their skills ,  helping to design ever-better expert systems to support case managers ,  and occasionally rotating into the case management role themselves 


-  ,  PHH Fleet America currently uses this case management structure of smaller but still critical functions ,  and case managers now perform most services for its customers fleet management requirements 


-  Functional areas have shrunk in size as they have given up operational duties to case management-oriented processes ,  and case managers report directly to process owners ,   


-  The few employees who remain in the functional areas continue to perform important roles ,  however ,  in creating and maintaining functional expertise among case managers and dealing with the customers most difficult questions 


-  For example ,  if  customer calls in with  maintenance problem on  fleet car ,  two times in three the Driver Services case managers can solve it using an expert system and the skills they have learned 


-  They refer the more difficult cases to expert maintenance mechanics ,  who can not only solve the problem but also add it to the case managers knowledge base if it is  recurring issue 


-  ,  In environments involving very high levels of expertise ,  there is an equal mixture of case management and functional experts 


-  This appears to be the situation in hospitals that have implemented case management approaches  ( or care teams as they are sometimes called )  


-  Although hospital case management teams can assume most patient care duties  ( including administering tests and medication ,  monitoring response to treatments ,  and overseeing preparation for and recovery from operations )  and also coordinate  patients movement from primary to acute to ancillary care ,  specialists are still needed for operations 


-  When case managers cant do everything ,  there is  clear need to specify where their responsibilities begin and end ,  and under what circumstances experts should be called in 


-  ,  In general ,  case management leads to strains in the organization 


-  Because it is  role based on  process view of the organization ,  some aspects of case management will frequently conflict with functional or divisional structures and with existing policies and procedures 


-  Functional managers will complain that the time-honored procedures and expertise of their functions are ignored 


-  Risk-averse executives will worry about including so much in one job 


-  IT managers will be concerned that case management technology is not rationally or reliably designed 


-  All affected employees will question how they fit into  case management structure 


-  Companies embarking on the case management role should be aware that many such conflicts will arise and be prepared to manage them 


-  ,  The keys to managing resistance to case management are well-known change management principles 


-  Communication with all concerned parties about the business objectives for adopting case management ,  the vision for how the process will work ,  and the likely impacts on these stakeholders is critical to securing cooperation 


-  Letting functional managers and employees in particular know about their long-term fates is the way to retain valued employees during ambiguous periods 


-  Furthermore ,  the sooner that employees know what skills are necessary to succeed as case managers ,  the earlier they can begin to prepare themselves with education and training 


-  ,   final approach to securing employee commitment to case management-oriented processes is one that we call partial work design 


-  In this approach ,   reengineering team designs from the top down the high-level description of  work process ,  including its inputs and outputs ,  performance objectives ,  organizational structures ,  and key technological enablers 


-  The case managers or teams who will perform them daily design the detailed work flows and activities of the process 


-  Their design participation builds adherence to the process and the job and reduces the alienation resulting from  Taylorist separation of work design from execution 


-  ,  The instances of case management we have observed thus far have been for single ,  specific processes at the customer-organization interface 


-  Because these initial efforts have yielded substantial benefits ,  companies have begun to explore whether they can extend case management concepts to  broad range of processes ,  including those such as financial transactions that are entirely within the organization 


-  ,  Even if case management is restricted to customer-interfacing processes ,  its value can be further extended into the organization 


-  For example ,  because the case manager oversees an entire customer transaction ,  he or she can provide useful feedback to product or service development 


-  An insurance case manager ,  for example ,  could suggest new insurance products based on customer requirements and report on customers comments 


-  ,  If we extrapolate case management trends to the extreme ,  organizations of the future could become collections of different types of case managers ,  each handling  closed-loop process for an internal or external customer 


-  The ad hoc networks bringing information to case managers desktops  ( or laptops )  would be the firms primary information architecture 


-  The organizational structure would be the case management nodes themselves  as individuals or ,  more likely ,  teams  and the communications and other relationships between them 


-  Before its financial problems ,   Mutual Benefit Life manager responsible for designing case management spoke of the one-person insurance company ,  which he saw as  logical extension of case management 


-  ,  Another alternative direction for case management is to move it out to the customer 


-  As already noted ,  IBM Credit is already exploring turning its customers into case managers ,  and this is  stated direction for Bell Atlantics carrier access case managers 


-  Of course ,  such  direction relies heavily on information technology to do most of the case work 


-  Furthermore ,  the issues of decision rights ,  breadth of the case management role ,  and monitoring all become greatly amplified  and potentially dangerous to customer relationships  when the customer is the case manager 


-  ,  Whether case management remains internal or external ,  it clearly presages more autonomous and networked work units 


-  And unlike most examples of the networked organization ,  it currently exists in many firms 


-  However ,  it is not possible at this point to understand if this networked autonomy is  positive long-term direction ,  or what issues will emerge if it catches on and burgeons 


-  The firms that pioneered case management have yet to adapt fully their organizational structures to suit the new role 


-  The functional structure is still in place ,  and most managers we interviewed believe it will always remain because of the need to maintain functional skills 


-  In insurance ,  for example ,  even when  case manager who has many other roles performs underwriting ,  the need for underwriting standards ,  training ,  and assessment does not go away 


-  ,   firm implementing case management today should start modestly ,  combining several functions and jobs and observing the outcome 


-  If combining labor rather than dividing it works well on this small ,  though radical ,  scale ,  the firm should add other functions to existing case manager roles and apply the concept to other areas within the organization 


-  Case management may not be relevant to all businesses and all processes ,  but it is being widely adopted across multiple industries ,  and firms are achieving substantial business benefits from it 


-  It has the potential to become the future of all business organizations ,  and it has already become the present for some
