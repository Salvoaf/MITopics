- Innovation is  perennial management challenge 


-  Thats why ,  for decades ,  MIT Sloan Management Review has been publishing new research and insights about innovation  from top researchers at business schools as well as from leading business executives and consultants 


-  ,  For this article ,  we tapped into that knowledge base 


-  We combed through our archives ,  looking for older articles with innovation insights that todays MIT SMR readers might have missed but that still retain wide relevance 


-  We then winnowed down our list of articles and set out to distill 12 key innovation insights from the MIT SMR archives into  succinct format 


-  ,  We present those selections here ,  in capsule form ,  so you can browse through them easily 


-  But you can also dive deep into any of these articles; weve assembled all the articles mentioned at https://sloanreview

-  ,  Innovation isnt just about developing new products or technologies 


-  In  2006 MIT SMR article The 12 Different Ways for Companies to Innovate ,  Mohanbir Sawhney ,  Robert  


-  Wolcott ,  and Inigo Arroniz encouraged executives to think broadly about what types of innovation are possible 


-  The authors noted that companies within the same industry tend to innovate along the same dimensions  whether those dimensions are research and development  ( R&D )  ,  process innovations ,  or branding 


-  Viewing innovation too narrowly ,  the authors pointed out ,  blinds companies to opportunities and leaves them vulnerable to competitors with broader perspectives 


-  Sawhney ,  Wolcott ,  and Arroniz used examples such as Starbucks ,  which initially innovated not by producing  different product but instead by creating  different kind of customer experience  what the company termed  third place for gathering that was between home and work 


-  ,  Business innovation ,  the authors stressed ,  has to do with new value ,  not necessarily new things  and comes in many flavors 


-  When  company identifies and pursues neglected innovation dimensions ,  it can change the basis of competition and leave other firms at  distinct disadvantage ,  the authors concluded 


-  ,  Technological disruption is one way to upend  market ,  but it isnt the only way 


-  For some companies ,  the secret ,  according to Constantinos Markides of London Business School ,  is to change the rules of the game 


-  ,  In researching his 1997 article Strategic Innovation ,  Markides studied more than 30 companies that had successfully attacked leaders in their industry without the benefit of  breakthrough technological innovation 


-  The common element in such successes ,  Markides found ,  was that the attacker changed the rules of the game ,   phenomenon he termed strategic innovation 


-  For example ,  Southwest Airlines changed the rules of the airline industry when it chose to fly its planes point-to-point rather than through hub cities 


-  Strategic innovation occurs ,  Markides wrote ,  when  company identifies gaps in the industry positioning map ,  decides to fill them ,  and the gaps grow to become the new mass market 


-  ,  Markides offered  framework for thinking about strategic innovation thats grounded in three basic questions: Who are your customers? What products or services should you offer them? And how should you offer them? To change the rules of the game in their industry ,  Markides noted ,  companies can either redefine the business ,  redefine who their customers are ,  redefine what they offer customers ,  redefine how they do business ,  or start the strategic thinking process at  different point  for example ,  the organizations unique capabilities 


-  ,  Of course ,  coming up with new ideas for strategic innovation does not guarantee success 


-  Its worth reemphasizing that coming up with new ideas is one thing; succeeding in the market is another ,  Markides wrote 


-  ,  Breakthrough innovation projects necessarily involve  high degree of uncertainty ,  Mark  


-  Rice ,  Gina Colarelli OConnor ,  and Ronald Pierantozzi observed in their 2008 article ,  Implementing  Learning Plan to Counter Project Uncertainty 


-  So ,  rather than try to apply disciplined planning techniques to such innovation projects ,  they proposed that companies focus on identifying and prioritizing the uncertainties that need resolution 


-  ,  The authors developed  framework for turning uncertainty into learning by studying large innovation projects at 10 technology-intensive companies ,  including GE and IBM ,  over  period of seven years 


-  They concluded that ,  in breakthrough projects where the shape of the future market has yet to be determined and where its unclear which applications will succeed ,  identifying milestones to achieve may not be the best approach 


-  ,  Rice ,  OConnor ,  and Pierantozzi suggested that companies develop what they call  learning plan to help teams examine four types of uncertainty: technical ,  market ,  organizational ,  and resource 


-  Managers can use the process ,  the authors wrote ,  to uncover gaps in knowledge and create  record of what is known ,  to prioritize which uncertainties are most critical and propose alternative assumptions about the reality behind each uncertainty ,  and to find ways to test assumptions and resolve the uncertainties as quickly and inexpensively as possible 


-   critical aspect of the approach ,  they argued ,  is proper oversight by people with experience in highly uncertain projects 


-  One risk of using people without such experience is that they may kill promising projects too early 


-  ,  One of the most enduring axioms of business is that ,  irrespective of whether youre running  startup or an established company ,  it pays to be first to market 


-  Golder explained in  1996 article titled First to Market ,  First to Fail? Real Causes of Enduring Market Leadership ,  the case for entering the market before anyone else can be  and often is  overstated and distorted by the nature of the data 


-  The authors pointed out that previous studies finding that pioneering companies gained an advantage had only surveyed surviving pioneers 


-  ,  The authors studied the history of 50 consumer product categories and found that pioneering companies had  high failure rate: 47% 


-  Importantly ,  the authors found that being  market pioneer was less advantageous from  market-share perspective than being what they called an early leader ,  one who enters the market after pioneers but becomes  leader in the markets early growth phase 


-  Early leaders ,  the authors wrote ,  tend to have low failure rates and significantly higher market shares than pioneers 


-  Early leaders had  vision of the mass market for the product; they persisted through business challenges; they were able to commit resources in line with their vision; they innovated relentlessly ,  even if it meant risking  ( or cannibalizing )  their other products; and they leveraged their assets 


-  In the disposable diaper market ,  for example ,   well-reviewed product called Chux predated Procter  Gambles 1961 introduction of Pampers by decades 


-  But P&G managed to leverage its technical and financial resources to build  position in the mass market 


-  market for light beer ,  several products predated the introduction of Miller Lite in the 1970s 


-  To build market share for Miller Lite ,  its parent company was willing to spend heavily on advertising  ( something one of the market pioneers ,  Gablingers ,  didnt do )  


-  ,  The takeaway ,  Tellis and Golder concluded ,  isnt that its better to be  follower than  pioneer 


-  Its that paying attention to the five leadership factors will have more impact on long-term success than whether or not you enter the market first 


-  ,  When developing new products ,  how do you determine what customers want and what they need? This ,  of course ,  is  classic challenge ,  one that managers have labored over for many years 


-  But in  1977 article titled Has  Customer Already Developed Your Next Product?5 Eric  


-  von Hippel of the MIT Sloan School of Management pointed out that many companies fail to take into account critical information thats available to them 


-  In studying manufacturers of scientific instruments and process equipment ,  von Hippel identified  pattern: Most of the innovative products commercialized in those industries were invented ,  prototyped ,  and used in the field by innovative users before equipment or instrument manufacturing firms offered them commercially 


-  Von Hippel found further that the manufacturer who takes advantage of user efforts needs only to contribute product engineering work to obtain  first-to-market product innovation 


-  ,  Users are willing to do innovation work and provide valuable information ,  von Hippel wrote ,  if they need the new product as much as or more than you do 


-   big challenge ,  though ,  is convincing internal people to accept the validity of information and ideas that come from the outside 


-  ,  Von Hippel further explored the user innovation theme in subsequent MIT SMR articles ,  including The Age of the Consumer-Innovator ,  which he coauthored with Susumu Ogawa and Jeroen  


-  In that article ,  von Hippel ,  Ogawa ,  and de Jong reported on new national surveys finding that individual consumers play an important role in both creating and modifying products 


-  Businesses ,  von Hippel ,  Ogawa ,  and de Jong advised ,  need to think about how to reorganize their product development systems to efficiently accept and build upon prototypes developed by users 


-  ,  In  fascinating 2007 article titled Breakthroughs and the Long Tail of Innovation ,  Lee Fleming explored the dynamics of invention 


-  Defining invention as  new combination of components ,  ideas ,  or processes ,  he explained that invention samples show an extremely skewed distribution ,  with the vast majority of inventions being useless ,   few having some value ,  and only  very few representing breakthroughs 


-  ,  As  result ,  Fleming argued that if companies want to achieve breakthroughs they should:  (  )  make lots of shots on goal ,  since only  few of the inventions they come up with will be breakthroughs;  (  )  try to increase the average value of each invention; and  (  )  increase the variability of the ideas they explore  in other words ,  take wild shots at  rich target  ( or preferably  set of rich targets )  because the wider range will be more likely to contain scores of maximum values 


-  Flemings research indicated that inventors working by themselves can be the source of more failures as well as more breakthroughs 


-  On average ,  lone inventors are not as creative or as successful as innovative teams  but ,  paradoxically ,  the loners are more likely to be the source of breakthroughs because the value of their inventions is so highly variable 


-  One challenge for companies ,  then ,  is finding ways to support and manage their lone inventors 


-  ,  Knowing when and how to open up product development to outsiders is difficult 


-  Which approach is better ,  working with external innovators organized into collaborative communities  ( as typified by Linux and other open-source software projects )  or tapping into the competitive marketplace for products and services to complement your product? According to Kevin  


-  In their 2009 article titled How to Manage Outside Innovation ,  the authors wrote that the decisions companies make about external innovation should be based on clarity about  (  )  the type of innovation they need from outside innovators;  (  )  the motivations of the outside innovators; and  (  )  the nature of the companys business model 


-  When the technology and consumer preferences are clear ,  Boudreau and Lakhani wrote ,  companies generally dont need external innovation: They can develop products internally or hire contractors 


-  However ,  in cases where some of the design elements are still being determined ,  opening up the innovation process can lead to significant benefits 


-  Collaborative communities generally work best when dealing with problems that draw on cumulative knowledge that extends beyond what individuals are likely to know 


-  Competitive markets ,  according to Boudreau and Lakhani ,  are better suited for problems that would benefit from broad experimentation across  set of technical approaches or customer groups 


-  Participants in competitive markets tend to be motivated by extrinsic factors such as financial rewards ,  while collaborative communities involve  greater emphasis on intrinsic rewards ,  such as intellectual challenge 


-  When evaluating whether to work with collaborative communities or competitive markets ,  companies should be aware of the different motivators and consider the type of mechanisms needed to align with them 


-  ,  The third issue managers need to take into consideration when deciding to open their products to external innovation is how that will affect their companys business model 


-  In determining whether to work with  collaborative community or  competitive market ,  the authors noted that its helpful to ask ,  Who sells to whom? The answer will affect the income streams ,  the companys relationship with its customers ,  and the future role external innovators will play 


-  ,  Opening your product to external innovation means that it will become  platform ,  Boudreau and Lakhani explained ,  and executives must decide which type of platform business model makes the most sense for their business 


-  Companies can either integrate external innovators work into their platform ,  allow external innovators to sell products on top of the platform ,  or create two-sided markets where external innovators and customers can interact 


-  ,  Luckily ,  the authors noted ,   companys innovation strategy neednt be cast in stone 


-  As the needs of the business change ,  the innovation strategy can change as well 


-  Initially ,  for example ,  Apple had  small group of partners producing applications for its iPhone 


-  The lesson ,  Boudreau and Lakhani wrote ,  is that a company needs to tailor its particular approach to the context of its specific business 


-  Sinfield explained in their 2008 article Institutionalizing Innovation ,  companies that are seasoned innovators have  set of capabilities that can take them from  plan for growth all the way through execution 


-  ,  The authors developed their insights into innovation from interviews at more than 40 organizations in an array of industries ,   survey ,  and fieldwork at more than 50 companies 


-  ,  So ,  how can companies move in this direction? As  starting point ,  management needs to develop  growth blueprint that articulates what the company wants to be  and the specific options it will and wont consider to reach its objectives 


-  ,  Another important element ,  according to Anthony ,  Johnson ,  and Sinfield ,  is determining how the company wants to allocate resources  both money and time  to satisfy its growth objectives 


-  One approach is balancing the innovation portfolio with  mix of improvements to the core business ,  extensions to it ,  and growth initiatives in new areas 


-  If  company fails to consciously allocate innovation resources among different types of projects ,  the authors noted ,  it will often end up with mostly incremental innovation projects 


-  Whats more ,  if the core business runs into trouble ,  there is an overwhelming temptation to tap resources that the company has allocated to more speculative ventures in order to save the company ,  they wrote 


-  ,  Although Anthony ,  Johnson ,  and Sinfield highlighted numerous questions that would-be innovators need to confront ,  they were careful not to be overly prescriptive about the answers 


-  Even within  single company ,  they argued ,  managers should be prepared to manage and measure different types of growth opportunities differently 


-  ,  Companies also need to construct what the authors called an innovation engine  which involves structures to screen ,  develop ,  and oversee innovative projects 


-  The authors pointed out that there are  number of different innovation structures that companies can use 


-  ,  Companies are increasingly trying to bring outside ideas into their innovation processes 


-  To do so effectively requires an understanding of two types of innovation brokers ,  according to Eoin Whelan ,  Salvatore Parise ,  Jasper de Valk ,  and Rick Aalbers 


-  In their 2011 article Creating Employee Networks That Deliver Open Innovation , 10 the authors drew on research they had conducted on the diffusion of innovative ideas through personal networks in companies 


-  Whelan ,  Parise ,  de Valk ,  and Aalbers explained the importance of both idea scouts and idea connectors 


-  Idea scouts excel at identifying novel external ideas ,  often via the web 


-  But ,  to effectively implement such ideas ,  the external focus of idea scouts needs to be complemented by interactions with employees who have extensive networks and influence within the company and  broad knowledge base   group the authors called idea connectors 


-  ,  Many R&D leaders pursuing external ideas through open innovation tend to emphasize only the role of idea scouts  which the authors see as  mistake 


-  Companies ,  they advised ,  should be thinking about formal mechanisms that bring idea scouts and idea connectors together 


-  Promising ideas ,  the authors wrote ,  will not mature into innovative outcomes unless they reach the parts of the employee network that have the expertise and influence to exploit them 


-  Williamson and Eden Yin ,  Chinese companies are tackling innovation in  fundamentally different way: Rather than going for major breakthroughs ,  they aim for faster development cycles 


-  For their 2014 article Accelerated Innovation: The New Challenge From China , 11 Williamson and Yin studied more than 20 Chinese companies in  variety of industries and found that by breaking the innovation process into small steps and parceling it out to teams ,  companies were able to complete projects and deliver results faster 


-  ,  For example ,  an outsourcing company serving the pharmaceutical ,  biopharmaceutical ,  and medical device industries was able to complete projects two to five times faster than comparable projects using conventional techniques 


-  ,  which had acquired IBMs personal computer business 


-  By breaking product designs into modules handled by small teams in parallel ,  it managed to cut its new product development cycle time in half 


-  Williamson and Yin acknowledged that many of the processes and techniques used by Chinese companies are also being employed by technology companies in places like Silicon Valley 


-  ,  Its common for companies to solicit ideas and feedback from their customers and then incorporate what they learn into future products and services 


-  But few have taken customer knowledge as seriously or as far as the Lego Group 


-  In recent years ,  the Danish toy company ,  whose multicolored plastic construction toys have been popular with children for decades ,  has actively explored new and productive ways to engage with the users of its products 


-  These collaborations have led Lego to surprising new areas of growth ,  the authors wrote in their 2012 article Collaborating With Customer Communities: Lessons From the Lego Group 


- 12 ,  Historically ,  Lego built products for younger children ,  but in the 1990s ,  it unveiled  new series of products that appealed to older users 


-  Lego user groups expanded globally ,  and innovative products produced by users  ( for example ,   computer-aided design software program for designing Lego models )  began appearing 


-  As the authors pointed out ,  many of the innovations from fans improved and extended the Lego building system or introduced new ways to use it that dovetailed well with how Lego itself thought of its products 


-  The company began reaching out to the fan community to solicit marketing ideas or feedback on products in development 


-  At times ,  Lego management found that adult fans lost sight of the fact that the companys primary end users were children ,  not adults 


-  In some cases ,  fans suggested applications that went beyond the parameters of what the products were designed for 


-  ,  From its experience working with its user groups ,  Lego developed  number of principles for working with customers in product development 


-  ( This includes being as clear as possible about the companys parameters for when projects are expected to begin and end 


-  )  Another lesson management learned was that relationships cant be one way: They need to be not only good for the company but also rewarding for users 


-  Instead of regarding collaboration as something that needs to be managed exclusively by the company ,  the authors wrote ,  it is fruitful to think of it as an ongoing dialogue between two allies 


-  ,  In the past ,  corporate managers often rose through the ranks and thus were very knowledgeable about the activities they supervised 


-  But the rapid changes brought about by technology have created  widening gulf between the expertise of managers and specialized technical employees  something Robert  


-  In  2007 article titled Bridging the Gap Between Stewards and Creators , 13 they wrote: Being  good supervisor traditionally meant encouraging sound business practices and introducing changes to those practices as conditions changed 


-   Now the changes sometimes come from key employees whose work managers dont completely understand 


-  ,  Conflicts between business-oriented managers and technical employees arent new 


-  Almost 50 years ago ,  management guru Peter Drucker highlighted both the importance of knowledge workers and the challenges companies face in managing them 


-  From  study of the development of the internet and interviews with internet pioneers ,  Austin and Nolan saw how misunderstandings between business-oriented managers  ( whom the authors called stewards )  and highly skilled technical employees  ( whom they termed creators )  caused delays in the adoption of new technologies 


-  Creators ,  on the other hand ,  were less concerned about overall efficiency and what was in the business plan and more focused on what they saw as  higher purpose and vision 


-  One of their guidelines for managers is to avoid antagonizing creators ,  even if it means putting up with someone who is difficult to manage; an effort to get rid of one creator could snowball into losing two or three ,  leaving the company short on key creative talent 


-  ,  The challenges in managing someone who never wants to do the same thing twice and who keeps going off on tangents are substantial and quite different from the more traditional challenges managers face ,  the authors observed 


- Its hard to pick up  current business publication without reading about the imperative to change 


-  Left silent in these arguments is which organizations will drive that change and how they will do it 


-  Academic research suggests that the ability to incorporate new ideas and technologies into existing ways of doing things plays  big role in separating leaders from the rest of the pack ,  and studies clearly show that it is easier to manage  sequence of bite-sized changes than one huge reorganization or change initiative 


-  But ,  while many organizations strive for continuous change and learning ,  few actually achieve those goals on  regular basis 


-  Two of the authors have studied and tried to make change for more than two decades ,  but it was  frustrating meeting that opened our eyes to one of the keys to leading the pack rather than constantly trying to catch up 


-  ,  In the late 1990s ,  one of the authors ,  Don Kieffer ,  was ready to launch  big change initiative: implementing the Toyota production system in one of Harley-Davidson Inc 


-  On the appointed day ,  Mr 


-  Oba arrived ,  took  tour of the plant ,  and then returned to Dons office ,  where Don started asking questions: When do we start? What kind of results should  expect? How much is it going to cost me? But ,  Mr 


-  Oba wouldnt answer those questions 


-  He was ready to spend money and he had one of the worlds experts on the Toyota production system in his office ,  but the expert  ( Mr 


-  Oba )  wouldnt tell Don how to get started 


-  Oba ,  tired of not getting an answer to his question ,  eventually walked out of Dons office 


-  Oba was trying to teach Don one of the foundational skills in leading effective change: formulating  clear problem statement 


-  Obas visit ,  two of the authors have studied and worked with dozens of organizations and taught over  , 000 executives 


-  We have helped organizations with everything from managing beds in  cardiac surgery unit to sequencing the human genome 


-  Based on this experience ,  we have come to believe that problem formulation is the single most underrated skill in all of management practice 


-  ,  There are few questions in business more powerful than What problem are you trying to solve? In our experience ,  leaders who can formulate clear problem statements get more done with less effort and move more rapidly than their less-focused counterparts 


-  Clear problem statements can unlock the energy and innovation that lies within those who do the core work of your organization 


-  But ,  when making change ,  neglecting to formulate  clear problem statement often prevents innovation and leads to wasted time and money 


-  In this article ,  we hope to both improve your problem formulation skills and introduce  simple method for solving those problems 


-   large and growing collection of research indicates that it is useful to distinguish between two modes of thinking ,  which psychologists and cognitive scientists sometimes call automatic processing and conscious processing  ( also sometimes known as system  and system  )  


-  When you are aware that you are thinking about something ,  you are using conscious processing 


-  With this ability ,  humans can innovate and learn in ways not available to other species 


-  ,  Automatic processing works differently from its conscious counterpart 


-  You cannot directly instruct your automatic processing functions to do something; instead ,  they constitute  kind of back office for your brain 


-  When  piece of long-sought-after information just pops into your head ,  hours or days after it was needed ,  you are experiencing the workings of your automatic processing functions 


-  In contrast ,  the automatic system works based on what is known as association or pattern matching 


-  When confronted with  problem ,  the automatic processor tries to match that current challenge to  previous situation and then uses that past experience as  guide for how to act 


-  For example ,  the automatic processing functions are the only parts of the brain capable of processing information quickly enough to return  serve in tennis or hit  baseball 


-  Psychologist Gary Klein has documented how experienced professionals who work under intense time pressure ,  like surgeons and firefighters ,  use their past experience to make split-second decisions 


-  Successful people in these environments rely on deep experience to almost immediately link the current situation to the appropriate action 


-  ,  However ,  because it relies on patterns identified from experience ,  automatic processing can bias us toward the status quo and away from innovative solutions 


-  It should come as little surprise that breakthrough ideas and technologies sometimes come from relative newcomers who werent experienced enough to know better 


-  Research suggests that innovations often result from combining previously disparate perspectives and experiences 


-  Furthermore ,  the propensity to rely on previous experiences can lead to major industrial accidents like Three Mile Island if  novel situation is misread as an established pattern and therefore receives the wrong intervention 


-  As we have all experienced ,  sometimes when confronting  hard problem ,  you need to step away from it for  while and think about something else 


-  Unconscious mental processes may be better able to combine divergent ideas to create new innovations 


-  After the flash of insight ,  conscious attention is again needed to evaluate the resulting combinations 


-  ,  When the brains associative machine is confronted with  problem ,  it jumps to  solution based on experience 


-  To complement that fast thinking with  more deliberate approach ,  structured problem-solving entails developing  logical argument that links the observed data to root causes and ,  eventually ,  to  solution 


-  Creating an effective logical chain starts with  clear description of the problem and ,  in our experience ,  this is where most efforts fall short 


- 11 If you fall into the trap of initially focusing your attention on peripheral issues for practice ,  chances are you will never get around to the work you really need to do 


-  Decades of research suggest that people work harder and are more focused when they face clear ,  easy-to-understand goals 


- 12 More recently ,  psychologists have shown that mentally comparing  desired state with the current one ,   process known as mental contrasting ,  is more likely to lead people to change than focusing only on the future or on current challenges 


- 13 Recent work also suggests that people draw considerable motivation from the feeling of progress ,  the sense that their efforts are moving them toward the goal in question 


-  Being able to measure the gap between the current state and your target precisely will support an effective project 


-  However ,  structured problem-solving can be successfully applied to settings that do not yield immediate and precise measurements ,  because many attributes can be subjectively quantified even if they cannot be objectively measured 


-  For example ,  many organizations struggle with so-called soft variables like customer satisfaction and employee trust 


-  Moreover ,  once you start digging into an issue ,  you often discover ways to measure things that werent obvious at the outset 


-  For example ,   recent project by  student in our executive MBA program tackled an unproductive weekly staff meeting 


-  The student began his project by creating  simple web-based survey to capture the staffs perceptions of the meeting ,  thus quickly generating quantitative data 


-  You will learn more and make faster progress if you do 12 one-month projects instead of one 12-month project 


-  ,  To appropriately scope projects ,  we often use the scope-down tree ,   tool we learned from our colleague John Carrier ,  who is  senior lecturer of system dynamics at MIT 


-  )  ,  Managers we work with often generate great results when they have the discipline to scope down their projects to an area where they can ,  say ,  make  30% improvement in 60 days 


-  This kind of small wins strategy has been discussed by  variety of organizational scholars ,  but it remains rarely practiced 


-  In our experience ,  this mistake tends to reinforce existing disputes and often worsens functional turf wars 


-  If you can solve that instance of the problem ,  you will be well on your way to changing your organization for the better 


-  While it is often difficult to formulate  clear statement of the challenges you face ,  it is much easier to critique other peoples efforts ,  because you dont have the same experiences and are less invested in  particular outcome 


-  Structured problem-solving is nothing more than the essential elements of the scientific method  an iterative cycle of formulating hypotheses and testing them through controlled experimentation repackaged for the complexity of the world outside the laboratory 


-  Edwards Deming and his mentor Walter Shewhart ,  the grandfathers of total quality management ,  were perhaps the first to realize that this discipline could be applied on the factory floor 


-  Since Demings work ,  several variants of structured problem-solving have been proposed ,  all highlighting the basic value of iterating between articulating  hypothesis ,  testing it ,  and then developing the next hypothesis 


-  In our experience ,  making sure that you use  structured problem-solving method is far more important than which particular flavor you choose 


-  ,  In the last two decades ,  we have done projects using all of the popular methods and supervised and coached over  , 000 student projects using them 


-  Our work has led to  hybrid approach to guiding and reporting on structured problem-solving that is both simple and effective 


-  We capture our approach in  version of Toyotas famous A3 form that we have modified to enable its use for work in settings other than manufacturing 


-  to support knowledge sharing in its factories by summarizing  structured problem-solving effort in  single page 


-  Though the form may often have supporting documentation ,  restricting the project summary to  single page forces the user to be very clear in his or her thinking 


-  ,  The next step in the A3 process is to document the current design of the process by observing the work directly 


-  Due to automatic processing ,  most people ,  particularly those who do repetitive tasks ,  cannot accurately describe how they actually execute their work 


-  ,  Because those who do the work often cannot fully describe what they do ,  you as  manager must get as close to the locus of the problem as you can and watch the work being done 


-  Taiichi Ohno ,  one of the founding fathers of the Toyota production system ,  developed the Gemba walk  ( Gemba is  Japanese word that roughly translates to the real place )  as  means for executives to find out what really happens on  day-to-day basis 


-  The goal is to understand how the work is really done 


-  This could mean watching  nurse and  doctor perform  medical procedure ,  engineers in  design meeting ,  or salespeople interacting with  customer 


-  ,  Senior executives are often quite removed from the day-to-day work of the organizations that they lead 


-  Consequently ,  observing and thoroughly understanding the current state of the work often suggests easy opportunities for improvement 


-  We give our students the following rule of thumb to guide their efforts: When you go see the work ,  if you arent embarrassed by what you find ,  you probably arent looking closely enough 


-  The investigation ,  however ,  revealed that for this type of invoice ,  the code was always the same; each invoice spent several days waiting for  piece of information that could have been printed on the form in advance! ,  Observing the work closely often shakes loose  variety of preconceptions 


-  ,  There are  variety of techniques and frameworks to guide  root cause analysis 


- 18 Since then ,  just about all structured problem-solving methods have offered one or more variants of the same basic method for digging into  problems source 


- 19 ,  The purpose of all root-cause approaches is to help the user understand how the observed problem is rooted in the existing design of the work system 


-  Unfortunately ,  this type of systems thinking does not come naturally 


-  Solving the immediate problem will do nothing to prevent future manifestations unless we address the system-level cause 


-  ,   good root-cause analysis should build on your investigation to show how the work system you are analyzing generates the problem you are studying as  part of normal operations 


-  If the root-cause analysis identifies  series of special events that are unlikely to happen again ,  you havent dug deeply enough 


-  For example ,  customer service hiccups often differ from instance to instance and are easily attributed to things that are once in  lifetime and could never happen again 


-  Digging deeper ,  however ,  might reveal  flawed training process for those in customer-facing jobs or an inconsistent customer on-boarding process 


-  ,  Once you have linked features of the work system to the problem you are trying to solve ,  use the Target Design section of the A3 form to propose an updated system to address the problem 


-  Often the necessary changes will be simple 


- 20 In the Target Design section ,  you should map out the structure of an updated work system that will function more effectively 


-  This might be as simple as saying that from now on we will print the general ledger code on the invoice form or something more complicated ,  such as changes to training and on-boarding programs 


-  The needed changes will rarely be an entirely new program or initiative 


-  Dont try to solve everything at once; propose the minimum set of changes that will help you make rapid progress toward your goal 


-  First ,  create an improvement goal   prediction about how much improvement your proposed changes will generate 


-  If your problem is 24% of our service interactions do not generate  positive response from our customers ,  greatly exceeding our target of 5% or less ,  then an improvement goal might be reduce the number of negative service interactions by 50% in 60 days 


-  Guidelines are the guardrails for executing the project; they represent boundaries or constraints that cannot be violated 


-  For example ,  the leadership guidelines for  project focused on cost reduction might specify that the project should identify an innovation that reduces cost without making trade-offs in quality 


-  Be sure that the plan is broken into  set of clear and distinct activities  ( for example ,  have the invoice form reprinted with the general ledger code or hold  daily meeting to review quality issues )  and that each activity has both an owner and  delivery date 


-  But ,  even as you start executing ,  you are not done engaging in conscious learning 


-  During this phase ,  interim project reports should be simple: The owner of the action should report whether that element is ahead of or behind schedule ,  what has been learned in the latest set of activities ,  and what help he or she may need 


-  For example ,  if the overall target is to reduce the number of poor service interactions by 50% in 60 days ,  then set intermediate goals ,  perhaps weekly ,  based on your intervention plan 


-  ,  Once the project is complete ,  document what you learned in the What Did We Learn and Whats Next section 


-  Here you should both outline the main lessons from the project and articulate the new opportunities that your project revealed 


-  If you exceeded your predictions ,  what does that tell you about future possibilities? In contrast ,  falling short of your target may reveal parts of the work system that you dont understand as well as you thought 


-  Finally ,  and perhaps most importantly ,  what problem are you going to tackle next?  well-functioning process ,  whether in manufacturing ,  customer service ,  or new product development ,  is the product of numerous small changes ,  and fixing one real problem often reveals many additional pressing issues 


-  ,  How does this process work in practice? To illustrate ,  we describe  recent case where one of the authors ,   hospital executive who had been introduced to the basics of problem formulation and structured problem-solving ,  used the techniques to improve organizational performance 


-  The human body often responds to the transplanted organs in dangerous ways 


-  But at the outset of the project ,  the team was able to see an average of seven patients per clinic session 


-  Running the clinic at less than 30% of its ideal capacity potentially compromised care  patients might have to wait longer to be evaluated  and had significant revenue implications for the hospital 


-  With  few iterations ,  Todds challenge led to the following problem statement and supporting background: ,  After adding some additional background information about the problem to the A3 form ,  Todd went on to understand the work 


-   little digging into the root causes revealed numerous ambiguities and departures from the way the system was supposed to work 


-  Patient arrival times were highly variable ,  due both to  lack of clarity on appointment details and to traffic patterns around the hospital; lab testing times varied depending on the time of day; different versions of the pulmonary function test  ( PFT )  were conducted; there was often little coordination between the doctors and the nurse practitioners; and large amounts of time were spent checking each patients medication list 


-  ,  Todd made two key decisions in analyzing the root causes and proposing changes 


-  )  ,  and were more able to make changes 


-  Second ,  Todd included every member of the team ,  from the administrative staff to the physicians ,  in analyzing the root causes and proposing changes 


-  Widespread inclusion allowed every individual to think about specific ways to address the problem in his or her own assigned area 


-  ,  The root-cause analysis led to several proposed changes 


-  The administrative assistant would call patients both  week and  day in advance to remind them about their appointments and provide advice on managing traffic and parking 


-  With these changes ,  Todd set  target of adding two patients per clinic session until the clinic reached  throughput of 18 patients 


-  Todd further outlined  clear set of guidelines ,  the most important being that quality of patient care could in no way be sacrificed during the project 


-  After the initial project was completed ,  the lung transplant clinic subsequently did reach  maximum flow of 18 patients per session 


-  ,  The increased throughput had several positive benefits 


-  Finally ,  Todds team got to control their work and improve it ,  generating clear gains in motivation and engagement 


-  ,  We always ask executives in our MIT Sloan classes: How many of your companies reorganize every 18 to 24 months? Typically ,  more than half of the people in the class raise their hands 


-  Change has become  big business ,  and any number of consultants will be more than happy to assist your company in your next reorganization 


-  Changing everything at once takes  lot of time and resources ,  and big initiatives often collapse under their own weight as senior executives ,  tired of waiting for the results ,  move on to the next big idea 


-  By focusing your scarce resources on those issues that really matter and enabling rapid learning cycles ,  good problem formulation and structured problem-solving offer  sustainable alternative to the endless stream of painful reorganizations and overblown change initiatives that rarely deliver on their promises 


- We live and work in an age when the need for corporate reinvention is treated almost as  given 


-  Countless CEOs talk about reducing hierarchy and increasing agility ,  flexibility ,  and connectedness to the market ,  and virtually every large company is transforming for digital 


-  Yet in most organizations ,  lip service to change remains more the order of the day than real change itself 


-  ,  Then again ,  you might work with Zhang Ruimin 


-  ,  based in Qingdao ,  China ,  has done what most chief executives dare not even dream about 


-  He blew up much of the administrative structure of  global manufacturing enterprise ,  eliminating 10 , 000 management jobs that once held it together 


-  And he has guided the organization to reemerge as  network of entrepreneurial ventures run by employees ,  whose compensation is based on the success of their products in the market 


-  ,  In its transformed state ,  Haier is no longer  traditional manufacturer corporation so much as  platform that provides financing ,  support ,  and coordination for microenterprises all focused on developing products and services for the smart home ,  the internet of things  ( IoT ) -based concept of  fully connected and networked household 


-  ,  Haier calls its management model Rendanheyi ,   term that refers to connecting employees with users 


-  The company sees it as  win-win model for reducing the distance between the organization and its end users to zero and moving as close as possible to  state of co-creation with the customer 


-  ,  This isnt the first organizational innovation Ruimin has led at Haier during his three decades with the company ,  but it is certainly the most profound 


-  In noting the honor ,  Jeffrey Sonnenfeld ,   senior associate dean of leadership programs at Yale ,  called Ruimin a genuine global business giant who inspires mythic awe in his competitors ,  his peers ,  and his fellow Chinese business leaders 


-  The interview was conducted through  translator ,  and  further exchange took place via email 


-  ,  Two things make us believe now is the time 


-  One is the internet ,  and the other is the internet of things 


-  The internet has closed the distance between parts of the organization and between the organization and its customers to zero 


-  This means that traditional management models  like Taylorism and bureaucracy as proposed by Max Weber  are no longer relevant 


-  Then there is the internet of things ,  which represents the next generation of the internet 


-  Despite  dozen years of development ,  the idea of IoT has not taken off  or as we like to say ,  it has not been ignited 


-  ,  We looked at this question from two different angles 


-  Weve talked to many corporations in the hope of finding  management model from which we can learn 


-  ,  Secondly ,  whats called for in the IoT age? Its  direct interaction with users and  focus on creating the best user experience 


-  However ,  in the traditional economy ,  there are no users ,  there are only customers 


-  ,  Why hasnt IoT been ignited? Because an interactive platform for users  where companies can take direction from the people who will buy their products  has yet to be created 


-  We need to establish  community economy with zero distance between customers and companies 


-  Our end goal is to have  true connection with our users and to create legitimate lifetime value for them via the internet of things 


-  ,  The platform is the only place for  business to go to 


-  By eradicating our middle management layer  and laying off more than 10 , 000 middle-level managers  we have destroyed the original hierarchical structure 


-  All the businesses have to succeed as innovative entrepreneurial enterprises ,  or they will be kicked off the platform 


-  The platform is also accessible to entrepreneurial projects from outside Haier 


-  ,  Three things 


-  This was totally unimaginable back in 2005 ,  when the idea for this strategic transformation was proposed 


-  ,  The second thing is the variety of markets the entrepreneurial teams can enter 


-  For example ,  our gaming laptop has grown to become the No 


-   market player in China in the short span of two to three years since the laptop team became entrepreneurial 


-  ,  But what has surprised me most is that employees have accepted the radical compensation change 


-  Previously ,  we used IBMs broadbanding model ,  where pay was determined based on an employees position and contribution 


-  If someone can meet the requirements  if they can help start up  business  then they will prosper on the platform 


-  ,  At the same time ,  we have external IoT entrepreneurs joining our platform because they believe it offers resources and support that other platforms do not 


-  We have developed  networked organization that attracts the most capable people 


-  ,  What we do is help people form communities of interest so that they can work together as entrepreneurs 


-  For instance ,  someone comes up with an idea for  product targeting  certain niche of the market 


-  And then people from different departments or disciplines  research and development [R&D] ,  sales ,  manufacturing ,  marketing  will sit down and analyze its viability across all the relevant dimensions 


-  ,  We also have microenterprises that focus on more cutting-edge projects 


-  For example ,  at  certain point of this endeavor ,  they must be able to attract external venture capital 


-  If they cant achieve the investment by an agreed-upon time ,  then they have to let it [the project] go ,  or we might invite another entrepreneurial team to work on the project 


-  ,   think most business leaders tend to view their employees as passive performers who take orders from their superiors 


-  According to traditional management philosophy ,  there are managers and those to be managed 


-  ,  The reason why  companys employees are not leaders is that they have not had the soil or platform to grow upon 


-  ,  In our model we have delegated the major powers of corporate executives to the employees  or at least to the microenterprises  including the power of decision-making ,  the power of selecting and appointing personnel ,  and the power of financial allocation 


-  ,  Thats  very important question ,  and one of our biggest challenges 


-  Its true that manufacturing workers do not typically face the market directly ,  but we can create  connection to the market by allowing our different production lines to compete with one another 


-  ,  We have 108 factories all around the world ,  each possessing many production lines; every production line is  microenterprise 


-  We evaluate the performance of these microenterprises based on cost ,  delivery and service quality ,  and market response to the products they make 


-  Some production lines are able to acquire many orders 


-  In this way the production lines are organically connected with the market 


-  ,  Moving forward ,  we are forging an even tighter connection by allowing users to work directly with the factory to place ,  customize ,  monitor ,  and take delivery straight from the production line 


-  ,  This is  question we are constantly reflecting upon ,  and it guides our direction 


-  Though we have turned Haier into an entrepreneurial platform ,  we are not an investment company 


-  The goal of an investment company is to put in money and take out profit 


-  ,  Our primary aim is to ignite the internet of things 


-  All the entrepreneurial teams on the platform  even though they cross industries  focus on the smart home in some way 


-  This is also why so many teams outside of Haier are willing to start up smart-home businesses on our platform 


-  On Haiers platform ,  businesses gain access to our sales network ,  logistics operation ,  and R&D system 


-  Haiers platform offers the help to IoT businesses that other platforms or funds cannot 


-  ,  Whats most important is our resolute aim to be the enterprise that can truly ignite the whole idea of IoT 


-  And this requires evolving from stand-alone products to products connected to the internet and on to  network of products and services all connected to each other 


-  ,  So ,  what has become of the electric refrigerator in this scenario? It has transformed from  single appliance into the hub of  network connected to 400 organic food suppliers that monitor inventory levels and keep the refrigerator stocked 


-  This model  and this level of interconnectedness  is really difficult to achieve in terms of both technology and business 


-  When youre taking into account this kind of transformation ,   true ignition for IoT becomes very hard to reach 


-  When it comes to business ,  Chinese companies basically replicate Western management 


-  So ,  its not as difficult for us to disrupt the model because its not Chinese in the first place 


-  In  typical Western company ,  activities are siloed by departments and then further cut up into more detailed tasks 


-  ,  In China ,  we tend to look at things from the holistic perspective 


-  If something is wrong with your stomach ,  then something is wrong with your stomach 


-  ,  So we are applying this traditional holistic thinking to our management transformation 


-  The internet and IoT require enterprises to see things from the whole and systemic perspectives and to stop dividing everything into tiny parts 


-  We are  global business and must be able to globalize Rendanheyi 


-  We acquired  consumer appliance business from Sanyo Electric Co 


-  So its working ,  although at present [it is] applied only in the Asia-Pacific region 


-  Its  very large American company with  standard linear management model ,  where every action has  basis 


-  Rendanheyi is  nonlinear management model in which employees must be able to answer the question ,  What do  do next? for themselves 


-  There is no one for you to ask  and thats  challenging transformation 


-  When most companies achieve success ,  they tend to fall into states of self-satisfaction and complacence ,  celebrating and falling in love with their achievements 


-  Even when we have  great success ,  we question where we can improve 


-  Because we have  DNA of self-negation ,  it is easier for us to disrupt ourselves and to accept the need for change 


-  We keep saying internally to our employees that theres no such thing as  successful business 


-  Theres only  business that is compatible with the task at hand 


-  Youre just doing the right thing at the right time 


-  Things change all the time 


-  The only thing that doesnt change is time itself 


-  So ,  if you dont keep up with changes ,  youll be quickly made obsolete 


-  ,  ( Laughing )  This question has been raised by many people 


-  Ive been working at Haier for more than 30 years ,  but even if  can keep working and keep leading the organization ,  it doesnt guarantee future success 


-  My task is not to cultivate  replacement but to cultivate many people who are willing to challenge both themselves and the status quo 


-  Rather than listening to my orders ,  my instructions  which might turn out to be erroneous  our teams follow the demands of the market and of our users 


-  ,  Nowadays ,  the management model in many enterprises is empowerment ,  but we are not empowering; we are returning all the power to the employees
