- Organizational America is working very hard these days to become more competitive 


-  Few organizations have been spared the necessity of taking serious action to fight increased pressures from home and abroad 


-  The message is clear: either become more competitive or run the risk of going out of business 


-  ,  Organizations have responded to this edict with  wide range of actions ,  including austerity campaigns ,  drastic restructurings ,  new technologies ,  enhanced customer orientations ,  and  host of enlightened management techniques designed to encourage workforce involvement and quality improvement 


-  In this flurry of activity ,  managers at all levels are being asked to work harder ,  work smarter ,  work longer ,  and question traditional approaches to managing organizational resources 


-  ,  With increasing frequency managers are urged to change the ways they think and act 


-  Organizations are spending millions on training and development programs ,  management retreats ,  quality improvement programs ,  and  variety of other approaches 


-  These intended reforms rest on the assumption that for any organization to improve the overall quality of its management group ,  managers themselves must be reshaped and imbued with  new organizational culture and operating philosophy 


-  Managers simply must improve their effectiveness or the organizations competitiveness is endangered 


-  business in this decade ,  especially for large companies ,  may well be the development of its management people 


-  ,  In this article ,  we argue that the way in which organizations manage their managers often derails or even sabotages their efforts at becoming more competitive 


-  In the rush to reform ,  they often overlook or misconstrue  number of basic managerial principles 


-  Surprisingly ,  we traced many of these dysfunctional managerial practices to beliefs that appear to be self-evident ,  but that on closer inspection turn out to be deceptive myths that adversely influence the management of managers 


-  ,  As one telling example ,  organizations typically fail to conduct effective executive appraisals 


-  Three years ago in Sloan Management Review we reported  study that found that executives were frequently frustrated by the lack of clarity concerning their responsibilities ,  the lack of input on ways to improve their performance ,  the absence of ongoing performance feedback ,  and the lack of regular and systematic performance reviews 


-  Performance-enhancing review and appraisal practices that were successfully applied to lower-level employees were botched when applied to upper-level managers 


-  As  consequence managers felt frustrated ,  isolated ,  and neglected 


-  Worse ,  they felt that oversights associated with the appraisal process hampered their development and future effectiveness 


-  That study indicated the need for  look at  broader range of issues 


-  But when we conducted the study discussed here ,  the results suggested  more critical question: Are higher-level managers managing their subordinate managers effectively? The findings are both enlightening and disturbing along  number of dimensions 


-  ,  We conducted in-depth interviews with 261 managers from eighteen different large service and manufacturing organizations in the United States 


-  These organizations were all profitable at the time of the study and included companies from the automotive ,  electronics ,  steel ,  building products ,  transportation ,  medical ,  and communications industries 


-  The participating managers represented fourteen different functional areas evenly split between operations and administrative support 


-  Forty-one percent were senior-level managers ,  36 percent were middle managers ,  and 24 percent were lower-level managers 


-  As  group they averaged forty-one years of age and had over nineteen years of work experience and twelve years of managerial experience 


-  ,  In these interviews ,  we asked managers to freely discuss:  )  how their superiors managed them;  )  factors that limited their effectiveness; and  )  suggestions they would offer those who manage managers 


-  We encouraged them to provide specific examples of their experiences  ( both positive and negative )  ,  concerns ,  and frustrations 


-  Our findings are the result of  systematic content analysis of their comments 


-  At least 65 percent of the managers in the study identified and discussed each myth described below 


-  ,  These interviews generated  great deal of convergence on how managers are managed  ( or mismanaged )  


-  The managers identified  number of common problems and frustrations that were traceable to their superiors behavior 


-  Upper-level managers appear to hold  number of assumptions about their subordinate managers that are problematic from the subordinates perspective 


-  These assumptions are critically important because they ultimately affect the upper-level managers behavior toward their subordinates 


-  We came to label these assumptions myths because they all initially appear to be accepted truths ,  even to the experienced eye ,  but all are questionable on either conceptual or practical grounds ,  and all have negative consequences 


-  We have included direct quotes from the interviews as  means of underscoring the issues and conveying the richness of the findings 


-  Most managers typically are more self-starting ,  self-directing ,  and autonomous than other lower-level employees 


-  Their positions in the middle to upper-middle level of the hierarchy actually inhibited the kind of autonomy they were expected to demonstrate 


-  It became obvious from our first interviews that managers believed that to be truly effective they needed more focus ,  guidance ,  and feedback than they were typically getting 


-  As  general manager in the steel industry put it: ,  Although managers wanted autonomy ,  they also wanted clear guidance and regular reassurance that they were on track and some clearly established guardrails to keep them from going over the edge 


-  Many managers expressed skepticism at the homily that managers are paid to manage: ,  The overwhelming majority of managers felt that their superiors treated them in ways that gave them some of the autonomy they wanted but  lot of the headaches they didnt want 


-  Self-management without input and interaction from the boss appears to be  formula for poor working relationships ,  foundering development ,  and ineffectiveness 


-  Perhaps surprisingly ,  this finding held even among vice presidents 


-  ,  Good managers are self-managing ,  often to an extraordinary degree 


-  They want ,  appreciate ,  and accept autonomy ,  but they also want input ,  attention ,  and guidance that only their superiors can provide 


-  ,  Although this myth is related to the first myth ,  the issues involved here are subtly different 


-  Consider the dilemma of  director of quality control in  large manufacturing operation 


-  He had had three bosses in the past four years ,  his department had shifted from staff to line ,  his own staff had grown from three to twelve ,  and he had taken on three major quality improvement programs in the past year 


-  Yet ,  he had little face-to-face contact with his boss and had not received any sort of formal performance review in over three years 


-  This managers job had changed radically ,  but his current boss failed to develop  clear picture of his current job expectations and performance standards 


-  This example was by no means rare among the managers 


-  Formal job descriptions ,  however ,  were not as important as having a clear-cut working agreement between you and your boss that accurately reflects your real job and priorities 


-  ,  Given the complex and dynamic nature of most managerial work ,  this problem is perhaps understandable 


-  What is more difficult to understand ,  though ,  is why those upper-level managers do not take more active steps to help subordinate managers keep focused ,  on track ,  and aligned with the jobs current demands 


-  As plant manager of  high-tech electronics operation put it: Managers tend to do what they are most comfortable with or what theyve done in the past ,  which is not necessarily the right thing to do now! ,  Even savvy managers need an unambiguous picture of what they are responsible for in their jobs and ,  just as important ,  what they are not responsible for 


-  Without leadership from the boss ,  the subordinate manager has less clarity of purpose and is less effective 


-  When confronted about the paradox ,  he indicated that more important issues tended to take precedence over concern with his people 


-  When pressed further ,  he added that his people could read the monthly report and performance indicators as well as  can 


-  Yet ,  he still wanted more feedback on his own performance from his boss ,  the CEO 


-  ,  Managers felt that the feedback they received from their superiors was often too nebulous or negative 


-  In truth ,  managers wanted regular and ongoing feedback regardless of performance level 


-  Managers firmly believed that they did not always know how well they were performing because of the ambiguous nature of their work 


-  And the lack of feedback only served to make their work even more ambiguous 


-  At the time of the interviews many managers feared that they were expendable ,  given the  


-  business climate ,  and this no doubt affected their insecurity 


-  As one middle manager put it: ,   vice president in the same organization made an almost identical comment later the same day and added ,  We all get  little weird wondering about how well we are doing 


-  ,  Managers want and need regular feedback on their performance 


-  Managers performing ambiguous work want unambiguous feedback ,  and they want it on  regular basis 


-  Managers regularly talked about the information explosion that they were experiencing in their organizations 


-  The key issue for these managers was never about having enough information but about having the right information 


-  Only  small percentage of their bosses received high marks for keeping them well informed on issues that affected them 


-  Being kept in the dark was  major frustration ,  especially when organizational changes were involved 


-  ,  Managers agreed that keeping informed was ,  without question ,  one of their responsibilities ,  but they wanted their bosses to be information facilitators ,  preferably through personal interaction 


-  They registered many specific complaints about the overreliance on memos as the primary communication vehicle  ( described variously as memo madness ,  memo mania ,  or memorhea )  and the absence of meaningful face-to-face communication 


-  They frequently mentioned  lack of information on such issues as the bosss current projects and workload ,  recent changes in the market or within the organization ,  strategic plans for the next year ,  recent budgetary developments ,  or activities in other departments 


-  These issues tended to fall into the category of things managers need to know and shouldnt have to ask about 


-  ,  Managers did not generally feel that their superiors intentionally withheld information but rather that their superiors simply failed to take the time to keep them informed: ,  Good managers are proactive information-seekers 


-  Their proactiveness is thus wasted on unnecessary work that their superiors could eliminate with better information flow 


-  All of the organizations in this study employed some form of formal or informal goal setting with its managers 


-  Indeed ,  goal setting was one of the dominant methods used to manage managers 


-  Upper-level managers apparently believe that goals represent the best method for focusing managerial action 


-   director of MIS summarized the view this way: ,  Goals do provide  target ,  but the managers in this study noted that ,  as usually practiced ,  managerial goal setting is characterized by three problems: the inappropriate nature of the goals;  lack of input in setting goals; and ineffective discussion of process and means concerning goal achievement 


-  Managers seldom had  chance to discuss the means to accomplish the goalsprocess and strategy issues 


-  An East coast plant manager: ,  Goals must be carefully established ,  provide for mutual input ,  and include some discussion of means and process 


-  To use goal setting in  cavalier manner breeds poor communication ,  Monday-morning quarterbacking ,  and ,  ultimately ,   stymied manager 


-  ,  These managers perceived their organizations cultures as increasingly competitive ,  especially in the managerial ranks 


-  They saw themselves as having to compete excessively for promotions ,  merit raises ,  bonuses ,  budgets ,  access to superiors ,  personnel ,  and  variety of other resources that seemed progressively more scarce 


-  Competition among managers is nothing new ,  but these respondents said that escalating competition can create  variety of problems if not properly managed 


-  First ,  todays managerial workforce is generally more aggressive and competitive than in the recent past 


-  Second ,  these managers are competing for  pie that seems smaller in terms of resources and opportunities 


-  An automotive plant manager describes the outcome: ,  One manager suggested that the competitive flames are typically burning among most managers ,  and they dont need to be fanned by the boss 


-  Managers criticized their superiors inability to recognize and properly manage conflicts between subordinate managers 


-  They believed that excessive competition led to impression management ,  gamesmanship ,  communications breakdowns ,  misguided egos ,  political maneuvering ,  and in extreme cases even sabotage and character assassination 


-  Managers made it clear that excessive conflict in the managerial ranks is quite commonplace ,  and that  manager can get trapped spending more time thinking about how to win or defend yourself than how to improve productivity 


-  ,   human resources director of  large service organization said ,  The problem is that many managers believe that it is best to just let the two parties slug it out and let the best one win 


-  Many managers also believed that some superiors intentionally pitted them against each other ,  thinking that competition would develop character 


-  Again ,  these beliefs are predicated on the assumption that competition is preferable to cooperationan assumption that has been recently called into question 


-   general manager: ,  Competition is effective among businesses ,  but not necessarily within  business 


-  Collaboration and cooperation within the organization are demonstrably better strategies for improving competitiveness in the business arena 


-  Upper-level managers must be careful to manage the resources that their subordinates need and to take proactive steps to reduce internal conflict 


-  ,  We all know that managers accomplish much of their important work by meeting and talking with other people in the organization 


-  Talk is the work 


-  But meetings too often get in the way of actually doing the work 


-  As  consequence ,  meetings ,  the richest ,  most immediate source of critical information ,  can become the bane of  managers existence ,  according to our respondents 


-  ,  The average manager in this study described spending an inordinate amount of dead time each week in meetings 


-  An MIS managers schedule for an average week contained no fewer than three to five hours of meetings every day 


-  Managers complained of too many meetings ,  involving too many people ,  discussing too many topics ,  lasting too long ,  with too few outcomes 


-  Some meetings are indeed important and useful ,  of course ,  but the average meeting was described as two times longer than it should be and generating half the results that it could 


-  One executive put it very succinctly: Meetings about projects ,  programs ,  procedures ,  and proposals tend to take precedence over people and productivity 


-  ,  Managers were also frustrated with the overinsistence on written documentation and paperwork 


-  The modern manager ,  it seems ,  is expected to document virtually everything and also to read everybody elses documentation 


-  They saw the excessive paperwork as effectively getting in the way of the work it was supposed to document 


-  Managers hated the rotten paperwork and the manufactured paper blizzard that tended to hinder ,  not help ,  their work 


-  Superiors ,  however ,  did not always see it that way ,  apparently believing that  paper trail was important and necessary to good management 


-  The paradox here is disheartening; techniques that are intended to assist work actually inhibit it 


-  ,  Meetings and paperwork should be designed to facilitate work and not to reduce time for performance-enhancing activities 


-   key question should be: Does the meeting or the paperwork increase the managers ability to do the job? ,  In these interviews managers frequently talked about their management style and that of their superiors 


-  Rogers sort ,  from the Darth Vader school ,  and a scorched-earth manager 


-  Managers agreed that there are indeed  variety of styles and that some are more effective than others 


-  ,  However ,  the managers noted that people in their organizations rarely discussed management style in  proactive or systematic fashion ,  apparently because superiors assumed it was futile to try to change someones style 


-  Superiors only raised the issue when there was  crisis or problem ,  at which time all of the managers difficulties were frequently conflated into the issue of style 


-  It appears that management style ,  which is rarely discussed ,  critiqued ,  and scrutinized in more normal times ,  is quickly the target of criticism and complaint when managers are struggling 


-  The interviewees ,  especially the middle managers ,  frequently asked ,  If management style can be criticized and torn apart after the fact ,  why cant it be systematically discussed and critiqued up front? ,  Consider the experience of  general manager of  Midwest manufacturing organization who had  corporatewide reputation for being hard-nosed but also for getting results 


-  For three years his operation was highly profitable and productive; he was viewed as  hero in the company and received large salary increases and bonuses 


-  In year four  strike hit his plant ,  and his management team revolted over his abrasive management style 


-  He was then brought to corporate headquarters and dissected for his inappropriate management style and behavior 


-  His retort: If my management style was  problem why didnt you tell me before now? He felt betrayed that his boss saw the problem brewing but said nothing 


-  ,  Managers felt that management style could and should be talked about 


-  One middle manager concludes: ,  Managerial style should not be  taboo subject 


-  Managers realize that their management styles might include ineffective traits and types of behavior 


-  Thus they want systematic discussion of their styles with their superiors before  problem or crisis 


-  ,  All eighteen of these organizations offered formal in-house training ,  from programs on basic supervisory skills for lower-level managers to programs on  wide range of topics  ( time management ,  budgeting ,  performance appraisals ,  leadership ,  quality improvement ,  customer service ,  etc 


-  )  for middle and upper-level managers 


-  In addition ,  almost all of these companies were willing to send their middle and upper-level managers to off-site programs 


-  However ,  these programs had  curious downsidethey raised the managers desire to change and improve ,  which caused frustration later when improvements couldnt be made 


-  One manager said ,  You get all pumped up and decide to turn over  new leaf: and then you come back to work and reality sets in 


-  ,  Managers traced the problem to their superiors who had virtually no involvement in the training program 


-  As  result ,  they failed to discuss with the manager what he or she learned and how it could be best implemented 


-  Managers believed that their supervisors were frequently indifferent to management development 


-   director of marketing services said: ,  Managers agreed that  one-shot training program seldom had  lasting impact on their performance without regular coaching and input from their superiors 


-  Said one manager: A once-a-year discussion of  managers development is woefully inadequate 


-  Once  year is  joke if that is the only time it is talked about 


-  ,  In contrast ,  the superiors who received the most positive comments were those who put effort into personally developing their subordinate managers 


-  Such efforts tended to enhance commitment ,  loyalty ,  and motivation to help the senior manager 


-  ,  Managers want their superiors to take  more active role in their development 


-  They need formal development ,  but it is the informal attention of their immediate superior that makes the real difference 


-  ,  One of the strongest findings in this study further affirmed the findings we reported in Sloan Management Review in 1988 


-  Most managers were not satisfied with the quality of their annual performance appraisals 


-  Given their concern over their ambiguous jobs ,  and the absence of regular and ongoing feedback ,  it is not surprising that managers registered strong and frequent dissatisfaction with the appraisal and review process 


-  Their appraisals were rushed ,  poorly written ,  filled with  lot of ambiguities ,  and lacked substance 


-  One manager sarcastically said ,  It is tough to pack  years worth of suggestions and criticisms into one hour ,  but my boss thinks hes good at it 


-  In principle ,  the review should be tied directly to the managers overall performance 


-  In practice ,   variety of factors frequently blurred the relationship between performance and performance reviews 


-  These included: the boss not really knowing the subordinates performance level; the superiors reluctance to be honest; departmental politics;  lack of clarity about what was being evaluated; differences over means used to achieve ends; and the influence of merit money availability on the evaluation 


-  ,  According to these managers ,  their appraisals would be more effective if they spent more time with their superiors clarifying their accountabilities 


-  At the same time ,  they need ongoing performance feedback to take uncertainty out of their inherently ambiguous roles 


-  These two key activities are not taking place to the degree that managers feel is necessary 


-  This lack has  debilitating influence on performance as well as on the annual performance review 


-  To give less than professional appraisals to professional managers creates the impression that performance and its evaluation are not well linked 


-  ,  We undertook this study to assess organizations effectiveness at utilizing what many consider to be their most important resource: their managers 


-  We found from these interviews that highly educated ,  well-paid ,  and achievement-oriented professional managers frequently had  variety of performance needs that were not being satisfied by their higher-level managers 


-  When managers of managers neglected to address these issues ,  the consequences were negative at both an individual and organizational level 


-  ,  When  manager fails ,  many people are quick to conclude that he or she is somehow incompetent or simply doesnt have the right stuff9 Comments like hes in over his head ,  or she just doesnt have it are frequently heard in organizational circles 


-  Although this view may be valid in some cases ,  the managers in this study offered an alternative perspective 


-  They cited example after example of managers who failed because they were mismanaged or simply neglected 


-  ,  One might ask whether our interviewees were somehow atypical or inadequate because they were frustrated by their jobs ambiguity ,  their lack of feedback ,  the overly aggressive goals they were expected to achieve ,  the abundance of meetings they had to endure ,  and the unstructured appraisals they lived with ,  among other things 


-  These characteristics are assumed to come with the managerial territory ,  especially as  person climbs higher up the organizational ladder 


- 10 But are all these attributes simply part of the nature of managerial work? Not necessarily 


-  ,  It is in vogue to talk about the dynamic ,  ambiguous nature of managerial work ,  the multiple goals that must be pursued ,  the importance of continuous development ,  and the significance of managerial performance for organizational success 


-  If these characteristics truly define managerial work ,  then why do these managers feel that their superiors are giving such little attention to these issues? If managers are in fact the pivotal group in an organizations long-term success ,  then it would seem reasonable to assume that managers need to be guided ,  mentored ,  and developed in  manner commensurate with the demanding nature of their jobs 


-  This study suggests that managers might actually need to be more effectively managed than others in the organization because of the sophisticated nature of their jobs 


- 11 ,  Several other factors also contribute to the 1990s call for improved management of managers 


-  First is the distressing recognition that managers believe they are disposable assets 


-  Either they must perform or give way to others who might be more effective 


-  Managers in this study wanted to be effective and worked hard to be effective 


-  Fear of losing their jobs not only powerfully motivated them ,  it heightened their need for support from their superiors 


-  Second ,  managers are highly dependent on other people in the organization 


-  They generally view their superiors as critical linking pins who help them manage and also understand the interdependencies that affect their overall performance 


-  Third ,  managers have  tremendous desire to move up the ladder and succeed ,  despite realizing that opportunities at higher levels have become more limited 


-  They view their superiors as being critical to the success they desire 


-  ,  Collectively ,  these factors suggest that managers want and need more input and guidance from their superiors 


-  Yet ,  senior managers seem typically to believe that managers are autonomous ,  self-starting ,  and self-directing individuals or they would not be managersa belief that governs their approach to managing their managers 


-  ,  Organizations would be well served to do some soul-searching on these issues 


-  The myths identified here should serve as  catalyst to reconsider individual or organizational approaches to managing managers 


-  To this end we believe that overall management and organizational effectiveness can be enhanced by emphasizing some fundamental managerial practices 


-  While many factors ,  such as subordinate managers professional maturity ,  tenure ,  and track record ,  influence their performance needs ,  the nature of managerial work makes it clear that all managers need their superiors involvement and support in achieving effectiveness 


-  Yet ,  refreshingly ,  they do not cost the company anything 


-  They instead require those who manage managers to be willing to reconsider how they view their subordinate managers and how they spend their work time 


-  ,  The managers in the study contributed to these recommendations 


-  They noted three specific sets of activities that superiors need to enact 


-  We emphasize three critical management imperatives: ,  These activities might cost the upper-level manager  little extra time over the work year ,  but they accrue benefits 


-  They will help build  more effective working relationship so that the two parties can meet both personal and organizational needs ,  together 


-  We do not intend to criticize ,  but rather to suggest that traditional approaches to managing managers need to be aligned to the demands of  


-  work culture in the 1990s 


-   general manager offered an analogy that is worth remembering in this context:
