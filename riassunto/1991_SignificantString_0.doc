-  Many business disputes seem to be approached this way today: no matter how diverse the parties ,  issues ,  or stakes ,  litigation is the answer 


-  But scorched-earth litigation followed by an on-the-courthouse-steps settlement is clearly not the answer to every dispute 


-  ,  Sensing the need for  better approach to process selection ,  both in-house and outside counsel have begun ,  with the help of academics and specialized professionals ,  to serve up  choice between traditional litigation and ADRalternative dispute resolution 


-  ,  Those who do opt for ADR face another vexing choice: should we go into arbitration ,  mediation ,  or  mini-trial? The standard ,  if somewhat unfair ,  criticisms of each process are well known: arbitrators split the baby in half; mediators never resolve really difficult cases; there is more trial than mini in mini-trials 


-  The choice among the two or three most commercially established ADR mechanisms often feels like the choice offered at  new and improved Procrustean Inn: not one ,  but three beds ,  accompanied by the familiar promise of an exacting fit 


-  ,  If no single dispute resolution process can effectively ,  fairly ,  and efficiently address all concerns raised by the rich universe of external business disputes ,  what the conflict managers need is  consistent analytical framework 


-  Instead of refining questionnaires or checklists for choosing between litigation and ADR ,  and instead of sorting through the benefits and drawbacks of standard litigation alternatives ,  thoughtful managers should change the question 


-  They should ask not which process should we use  ( suggesting  choice among discrete options )  ,  but how can we resolve this conflict? They should try to understand the dispute and determine whether designing  more well-suited resolution process is cost effective 


-  Borrowing problem-solving tools from engineering and medicine ,  conflict managers should attempt to understand what about the conflict has prevented its being quickly and effectively resolved 


-  ,  In this essay ,   propose  methodology to allow managers and their counsel to consider systematically either particular conflicts or categories of disputes and then to devise ,  refine ,  and implement appropriate procedures for dealing with them 


-  The method ,  structured as  set of inquiries that the disputants may attempt to answer independently or jointly ,  starts by positing  standard against which one might measure success 


-  The conflict managers can then consider existing difficulties or symptoms against the backdrop of that clear objective 


-  Next they can then try to formulate  diagnosis based on their real-world understanding of business disputes and try to prescribe some general approaches or strategies 


-  At each step of the way ,  the conflict managers can rely on the articulated measure of success to instruct their analysis and evaluate their prescriptions 


-  ,  This methodology should prove useful at different levels 


-  ,  An effective dispute resolution process should help the parties understand their own and each others interests 


-  Without understanding the basic wants ,  needs ,  or fears motivating the dispute ,  the parties will find it difficult to obtain anything but zero-sum ,  purely distributive results 


-  ,  While positions may be in conflict ,  underlying interests need not be 


-  The company had never offered to do so because it did not understand the interest underlying the engineers bargaining position 


-  Absent such  process ,  the parties may fail to uncover  range of possible agreements that would satisfy their interests without the need to compromise between initial positions 


-  That might mean ,  for example ,  that the process would include mechanisms that temporarily replace the parties need to trust each other by guaranteeing performance in some easily enforceable manner ,  or that it would specify use of  third party to help set aside personality issues 


-  ,  Both relationship functions add up to the same thing: the process should leave the parties at least slightly better able to deal with each other next time ,  whenever that happens to be 


-  That need not mean the corporate equivalent of  long-term love affair ,  but parties who would find it mutually beneficial to work together should not be prevented from doing so because their dispute resolution process has made it even harder for them to speak to each other 


-  What may seem like  foolish or risky approach at first glance may ,  after reconsideration and refinement by others ,  develop into  mutually profitable one 


-  ,  Costly and inefficient as it may be ,  litigation does incorporate certain norms and rules that society believes are essential to the social order 


-  For an alternate process to succeed ,  the parties must believe it will produce  good solution without requiring them to give up substantial rights they would have had in litigation 


-   desirable dispute resolution process should instill in the parties  sense that the solution is fair and equitable and was arrived at in  principled fashion 


-  In order to be effective ,  the process must appear ,  along whatever axis the parties consider most important ,  to be preferable to litigation 


-  If cost is of principal concern ,  the new process should be less expensive than litigation; if confidentiality is at issue ,  it should afford the parties greater control over disclosure; if  long-term relationship is at stake ,  then perhaps the process should produce forward-looking solutions rather than allocate blame 


-  For instance ,  in  consent-based process the parties might well agree to take more constructive steps than anything  court could order them to do 


-  ,  Many  dispute escalates because one side misunderstands what the other has said or done 


-  If such misunderstandings are common enough among trusted business partners ,  they are legion among adversaries and especially their zealous advocates 


-  Why do we inevitably see the others actions in the worst possible light and expect them to give us the benefit of the doubt? Part of the reason is that we all operate on the basis of many unstated assumptions 


-  One common assumption about adversaries is that they want what we want and that if something is good for them ,  it must be bad for us 


-  ,  Similarly ,   great many of us tend to see the facts in the way most favorable to our own side 


-  Once we make up our mind about something ,  we tend systematically to filter out inconsistent data and to gather as much supporting evidence as possible 


-  When they report back to him with their preliminary research  ( which is usually quite favorable )  ,  he tells them ,  Remember this well ,  because this is how strong our opponents think their case is; now prepare our case in response 


-  ,  Understanding someones concerns need not make us agree with them; it should ,  however ,  help us persuade them that they do not have to meet their needs at our expense 


-  If an executive cannot make herself understood ,  how can she influence anyone? And if she does not understand her counterpart ,  how can she craft  persuasive proposition?  good process for resolving disputes should establish and maintain effective communication channels 


-  ,   good process should enable the disputants to craft wise commitments after they have carefully considered all the relevant information and  number of possible options ,  and after they have determined that their alternatives away from the table are not as good as what they can obtain through  negotiated agreement 


-  She asks the patient to describe his symptoms ,  to explain in some detail what has brought him into her office in search of  remedy 


-  Good managers ,  before launching into conflict resolution ,  should try to understand the conflict as well as possible 


-  Before they can put something right ,  they must identify what is wrong; in doing so ,  they should consider both the nature of the dispute and the traditional means of resolving it 


-  ,  Although categorizing complex business conflicts is no easier than describing everything that can be physically or psychologically wrong with  human being ,  conflicts do have some characteristics in common that may instruct the resolution design 


-  The methodology described here poses  series of inquiries concerning the parties and the issues 


-  No single answer to  question will determine conclusively the best process to follow; each response will ,  however ,  help to identify concerns that should somehow be acknowledged 


-  ,  The questions that follow are designed to help conflict managers gather and structure information 


-  They should also challenge conflict managers to question their assumptions about their own interests ,  the other sides intentions ,  the likely perceptions of third parties ,  and so forth 


-  ,  How many parties are there? Are they individuals or institutions? How sophisticated  ( financially and legally )  are they? Is either party  repeat player with respect to this type of conflict ,  or is this likely to be  one-shot experience for both? ,  By knowing something about the number and relative sophistication and experience of the disputants ,  the conflict manager can better design  process that addresses each of their interests 


-  Large institutional entities with experienced in-house or outside counsel ,  for example ,  may be less likely to require  process that provides education and reality testing than would individuals who have never litigated previously or who may be ill equipped to evaluate complex settlement proposals 


-  ,  Do the parties agree about what is at stake? Is this  dispute over money? If so ,  is the conflict over  fixed sum ,  or will  subjective determination of the amount be required? Is this  dispute about assigning blame for past conduct ,  or is the primary goal to define permissible future conduct? Is publicity  major concern for either party? Does this dispute primarily concern the relative competitive posture of the parties? Is this merely strategic litigation ,  with no substantive goal other than to delay or distract? ,  Understanding what is at stake requires more than reading the prayer for relief in  civil complaint 


-  Without developing  clear sense of the disputants underlying interests ,  it will be difficult ,  if not impossible ,  to design  procedure that allows each to feel confident that his or her interests can and will be addressed 


-  In designing  procedure ,  care must be taken to consider whether one or both parties would want the results exported to other disputes ,  or whether confidentiality of the outcome and avoidance of setting  precedent is the key to resolving the conflict 


-  ,  Is speedy resolution important to either party? Would either benefit from delay? Why? Is it simply  matter of the stakeholder enjoying the time value of the money or are other factors at play? ,  Speed is often one of the first items on the list of ADR advantages 


-  But is it always  good thing? Although over-crowded dockets generally cause some of the delay associated with litigation ,  litigants are themselves responsible for substantial delay 


-  Conflict managers must consider the relevance of the passing of time to one or both disputants ,  whether to allow tempers to cool ,  fiscal years or reporting periods to close ,  or key personnel to turn over 


-  These can be as important ,  in some cases ,  as the time value of money or the urge to bring unpleasant situations to  prompt conclusion 


-  ,  What are the various stages through which the litigation must go? What is the intended purpose of each? In practice ,  what happens at each stage? How much time typically passes between each phase? At what points are these suits typically settled ,  if at all? ,  Dispute resolution procedures need not be wholly divorced from litigation ,  nor need they be  complete substitute 


-  Alternative procedures may actually complement litigation ,  for example ,  by streamlining discovery and reducing the number of disputed questions of law or fact 


-  By developing an understanding of the various stages of the traditional litigation path ,  parties can better design  process tailored to their needs 


-  The key question ,  however ,  is at what cost does it accomplish these objectives? Is this  product worth buying ,  or could the same interests be met for less? The decision to litigate is  business decision 


-   manager charged with that decision must consider the alternatives and compare how litigation fares with other means of meeting personal and institutional interests 


-  In that sense ,  there is nothing new ,  different ,  or unusual about it 90 percent to 95 percent of all civil lawsuits are settled 


-  Having developed  picture of the conflict ,  the conflict manager should now ask ,  Why havent the parties settled yet? ,  The range of possible answers to this question is very broad 


-  ,  Have negotiations to date focused on demands and concessions? Are the parties being forthcoming about their underlying interests? If pressed ,  could each party answer the following questions in  manner to which the other would agree: What do your counterparts really hope to accomplish in this dispute? and For what purpose? ,  One exceedingly common cause of breakdowns in negotiations is that both parties get locked into extreme positions from which neither can easily make concessions 


-  For example ,  as long as the engineer and the manufacturing company were locked into  positional haggle over the royalty percentage ,  they could make no progress without one side or the other feeling that it had backed down 


-  In diagnosing why the dispute has not yet been resolved ,  it might be useful to know whether the real problem has become the people involved 


-  ,  Who has introduced the options that have been considered so far? Does one party typically take the lead in presenting proposals ,  or do the parties share the burden? Are the parties reluctant to put the first offer on the table? Do time constraints operate differently on them? Do cost constraints affect the settlement  (  


-  ,  Do the negotiators have critical constituencies to which they must report their handling of the dispute? Do those constituents expect their agents to follow certain rituals? Are there readily available standards ,  within the industry or otherwise ,  that cover how disputes such as this one are settled? ,  One reason  party refuses to settle  dispute may have more to do with the dispute resolution process than with the settlements content 


-  Similarly ,   party may reject an attractive offer if the terms seem unrelated to any external standards or somehow conjured up out of thin air 


-   partys inability to explain the logic of  particular settlement to its constituents may well stand in the way of  profitable resolution 


-  ,  Do the negotiators have access to an objective assessment of the dispute ,  whether internally or outside their institution? Have they done any systematic analysis of the litigation risk? How carefully have they thought through the nonmonetary consequences of not settling? ,  Sometimes the principal impediment to settlement stems from one or both parties limited understanding of their procedural alternatives 


-  Only after careful analysis did they realize that if either prevailed in court on its principal theories ,  they would open the market to  host of new competitors ,  to the detriment of both 


-  Without that understanding ,  however ,  there had been little room for settlement: each viewed its chances of prevailing at trial optimistically enough that no settlement offer or counter-offer that either could reasonably propose was likely to be acceptable to the other 


-  ,  What channels do the decision makers use to communicate? Do they always go through lawyers or other agents or do they sometimes communicate directly? How does each party perceive the others motives? Do the parties disagree on the facts or on the inferences to be drawn therefrom? ,  If the parties have very different pictures of the conflict and consequently have drawn very different conclusions as to how to resolve it ,  it may be impossible for them to reach an agreement 


-   debtor and  creditor may look at the distribution of proceeds from asset liquidation in the same way the pessimist and the optimist observe the proverbial glass of water: one perceives the glass as half empty ,  posing the problem of how to refill it ,  while the other perceives it as half full ,  presenting an opportunity to distribute its contents between the parties 


-  Or perhaps each side has access to only part of the information necessary to understand the situation and its context 


-  Depending on the primary reasons for the differing perceptions ,  the conflict managers might devise procedures for gathering information ,  testing the objectivity of the parties perceptions ,  or facilitating their discussion of such perceptions 


-  To get past the unproductive clash of perceptions ,  each party must be helped to understand how the other sees it ,  without feeling that to understand that perspective means it has also to agree with it 


-  ,  Assuming some agreement could be reached ,  would it require  one-time act ,  such as  cash payment ,  or would compliance involve an ongoing commitment to  more complicated program? What issues must  settlement address? Who would have to cooperate in order to make the agreement operational? ,  If the parties have not considered or discussed with each other what the outline of an agreement would look like ,  they may develop very different ideas 


-  If one views the problem as an imminently bursting dam in need of an immediate stop-gap solution ,  while the other thinks the dispute is really about the long-term management of  complex navigation and irrigation system ,  they will be working toward radically different objectives and each will have  tough time understanding the other 


-  Unless the process can help them clarify the nature and scope of the final commitment ,  they will probably escalate the conflict in an effort to impose  solution 


-  Consequently ,  both sides increase combat ,  to remind the other side of how bad things can be in the absence of an agreement 


-  ,  If the parties are locked into  positional bargaining battle in which substantial concessions seem unlikely ,  mechanisms to clarify their interests ,  as distinguished from their positions ,  may be of value 


-  Only after extensive prodding by an outside facilitator did he admit that his problem was not that he needed $400 , 000 ,  or that he thought the magazine was worth that much 


-  If neither party has sufficient information ,  perhaps  joint or neutral fact-finding process would help 


-  If one side is concerned that the terms of an agreement will be disclosed ,  the conflict managers might incorporate into the process some means of managing the flow of information about the agreement 


-  ,  Sometimes ,  the greatest impediment to settling  dispute comes from the way in which the conflict has been framed ,  which in turn constrains the types of options the parties consider 


-  To the extent that the parties view the problem as principally involving the distribution of something money ,  liability ,  kudos ,  or blamethey will conclude that more for one necessarily means less for the other and will proceed to address the problem on that basis 


-  Some conflicts ,  because of the parties needs and resource constraints ,  may never be settled unless someone attempts to generate mutual gains 


-  ,  Do the parties place different values on possible outcomes or on different goods and services? Do they face different tax or other incentives? Do they have different concerns about publicity? Do the parties have different expectations about contingent events ,  different attitudes toward risk? Do they have different preferences about the resolutions timing or the performance of the settlement? ,  One school of thought suggests that the best way to resolve  dispute is to minimize the parties differences 


-  Some parties may just have too diverse  set of interests and expectations to be homogenized 


-  Many  business alliance is struck not because the parties are similar ,  but precisely because the parties have different strengths or perspectives that they believe make for  good fit 


-  ,  Is cooperation between the parties  desirable and efficient manner of resolving the problem? Are economies of scale possible? Do the parties have shared interests in some substantive outcome ,  public good ,  or public perception of their handling of the dispute? Can one side take steps to benefit the other significantly at minimal cost to itself? ,  Cooperation with the enemy is usually the last thing disputants consider 


-  Yet it is precisely because that whole class of solutions is so often overlooked that it should be systematically considered in almost every dispute 


-  The failure to systematically consider those options costs money 


-  ,  In many business conflicts there are also activities that both sides would agree constitute  good use of resources and from which both would derive at least indirect benefit; they should consider committing part of what is at stake in the conflict to some such mutually beneficial activity instead of squandering more resources in fighting over how to allocate the nominal stakes between them 


-  The first step defined  desired outcomean effective process for managing business disputes 


-  ,  If the process replaces traditional litigation ,  should it aim primarily at facilitating settlement ,  or would some sort of partial or streamlined adjudication be preferable? How should the alternative procedures interact with the traditional litigation track? Should litigation be temporarily stayed? Should judicial approval of the alternative procedures be sought in advance? ,  Sometimes the only way to apply sufficient pressure on the parties to reach  productive settlement is to keep litigation going full steam ahead while someone else tries to settle the case on  second track 


-  ,  Should the outcome be binding on the parties ,  or merely advisory? What will be gained or lost in the flexibility of the process ,  the seriousness with which parties participate ,  or their willingness to accept the process at all? ,  The procedures should help the parties craft  solution that meets their interests ,  feels legitimate ,  and is preferable to their best alternative away from the table 


-  Such procedures need not impose an outcome on any party; indeed ,  by definition any such solution will enjoy the support and consent of every party 


-  ,  Would  neutral party be of some help? In what capacity? Should  neutral facilitate communication between the parties ,  evaluate their positions ,  generate settlement proposals ,  or ascertain facts? Each of these involves different degrees of intrusion into the process by  stranger to the conflict 


-  What procedural deficiencies might the neutral address? Is there some other way of addressing them effectively? ,  Many of the tasks neutrals undertake actually require only someone who does not have  vested interest in the resolution of the conflict ,  rather than  wholly nonpartisan stranger 


-  So-called wise men procedures ,  whereby senior executives within two organizations are designated as process resources to help jointly resolve ,  for example ,   dispute between line managers ,  are worth considering for any complex ,  long-term business relationship 


-  ,  How formal or informal  process seems best suited to the parties and the dispute? Should rules be specified concerning the stages of the process or their timing? What rules of discovery ,  if any ,  should be incorporated? How should the presentation of evidence and testimony  ( whether to each other or to  neutral )  proceed? Should there be avenues of review? ,  At the risk of turning the design process into  legislative drafting exercise ,  it is important that the conflict managers think carefully through the operational aspects of the process and the consultative and verification mechanisms that will be necessary to resolve the inevitable procedural disputes 


-  Not only must they think about what process would best help the parties resolve their substantive conflict ,  but they must consider how to deal with disputes about the process itself 


-  The parties can decide whether they will cover their own costs or allocate costs some other way 


-  Although there may not be an easily identifiable winner in the sense there is in litigation ,  it may be worth considering whether those responsible for making the parties incur additional costs should bear them 


-  ,  Although once  conflict arises it may be more difficult to establish the kind of joint problem-solving relationship that might have been available earlier ,  more facts may be known at that time ,  and these should permit the parties to devise  process better suited to the specific dispute than to  hypothetical conflict 


-  Mutual consent will generally be required to undertake anything but traditional litigation 


-  ,  The analysis described here should enable managers facing an escalating conflict to do several things: first ,  they should be able to decide whether it is worthwhile to structure  custom dispute resolution process and to discuss the option clearly and systematically with legal counsel; second ,  even if the conflict managers choose not to negotiate about the process ,  by having diagnosed the existing problem they should be better prepared to think about how to settle it on the merits; and third ,  if they decide to approach their counterparts to discuss the possibility of  better process ,  they will be prepared for negotiating over it
