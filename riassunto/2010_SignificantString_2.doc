-  They think theyve found what theyre looking for at one store ,  but on the way to the register one of the girls takes out her phone and swipes it by the barcode of the product theyve selected 


-  In fact ,  the technology needed to make it happen is already in place 


-  It will affect the de facto license of  business to operate   license that customers wont hesitate to revoke 


-  ,  Many executives understand how these dynamics will fundamentally alter their businesses ,  and they understand that sustainability is ,  ultimately ,  about the sustainability of their own organizations 


-  In fact ,  it entails three distinct phases ,  each requiring different leadership skills 


-  When implementing  business strategy that commercially incorporates sustainability ,  managers must first recognize how such efforts are unique ,  and then understand how best to advance through each major stage of  sustainability initiative 


-  The most advanced of these organizations are now thinking of sustainability as  core value  the fundamental way in which they do business 


-  To achieve that kind of transformation ,  executives must first understand the three basic ways in which sustainability is substantively different from other kinds of corporate initiatives 


-  Companies that market their external image beyond their actual accomplishments are risking serious damage to their corporate reputations ,  the impact of which can extend far beyond any individual brands 


-  Employees might be unaware of the threats and opportunities involved until something happens that brings the issue onto the senior leaderships radar screen 


-  The trigger has often been explicitly reflected on the C-level dashboard  ( impending regulatory action or media exposure from environmental disasters ,  for instance )  but increasingly it is rooted in more gradual trends  ( such as the growing scarcity of  key manufacturing input or the evolution of comparative product metrics )  


-  Either way ,  the organization begins to engage with sustainability but lacks  shared and consistent understanding of what it means 


-  This process can be difficult because senior executives might not yet fully appreciate the significance of the issue 


-  The leader must communicate  compelling vision and gain buy-in from key opinion formers in the organization 


-  To do so ,  the leader must be able to understand the motivations of different stakeholders ,  and engage and partner with managers to weave sustainability into the fabric of the organization 


-  In addition ,  the leader must possess the ability to understand and overcome the barriers to adopting sustainability 


-  The initial mandate for the sustainability leader might be surprisingly vague ,  expressing only the general sense of  need to act 


-  First ,  he wanted to maximize the impact of the council ,  and he realized that doing so required decision makers 


-  Third ,  he believed that having leaders of different products and geographies on the council would enhance the companys ability to cross-pollinate successful initiatives across the entire organization 


-  It was  good deal for the plants as they realized that the best ideas across the company would get funded ,  recalls OBrien-Bernini 


-  Others took more effort ,  as in the case of  production line that was redesigned to operate on significantly less pressure ,  which not only conserved the energy used by the air compressors but also resulted in fewer leaks and longer life for the manufacturing equipment 


-  One effective approach is to help grow the top line ,  for example ,  by finding buyers for substances previously considered waste  ( such as partially cured resins ,  compost or impure ethylene glycol )  


-  To accomplish this ,  they frame the dialogue in terms of issues that matter to managers ,  delineating the elements of sustainability that register as commercially substantive risks or rewards 


-  The leader must be able to translate  sustainability vision into  comprehensive program of targeted initiatives that can be tracked using clear metrics ,  and must take corrective action when performance falls short of expectations 


-  This could be something as simple as reducing the daily number of dumpster hauls ,   change that was made at  plant in Amarillo ,  Texas 


-  Instead of regarding machinery as broken only when it ceased to function ,  employees at Owens Corning began to consider equipment broken when its operation was inefficient 


-  A constant-speed fan running at about 70% of the efficiency of  variable-speed fan is actually broken ,  explains OBrien-Bernini 


-  And if you fix it ,  youll get  big drop in energy consumption that [improves] the bottom line 


-  ,  Phase  is not simply about becoming  better corporate citizen through increased sustainability 


-  Successful leaders in this phase understand how to leverage sustainability into an advantage in the marketplace 


-  The company now champions the fact that it has increased the amount of certified fiber used in its magazines from 20% to 80% 


-  Moreover ,  the publisher realized that this was just the first step 


-  ,  Sometimes ,   deep knowledge of sustainability issues can ,  by itself ,  provide  huge competitive advantage when leveraged in the appropriate ways 


-  At Owens Corning ,   general manager of one of the businesses was working with  potential customer seeking to manufacture carbon-neutral products 


-  The ability to engage in that type of conversation not only won Owens Corning  large materials contract but also led the company to realize it could begin to use its sustainability leadership position to create differentiated value with customers 


-  These executives are motivated by commercial targets and view sustainability as one arrow in their quiver to hit those targets 


-  In the case of the magazine publisher ,  the companys increased use of certified fiber and its participation in helping to create citywide recycling programs were motivated by advertisers beginning to become concerned about placing ads in publications that had potential liabilities with respect to the environment 


-  The publisher chose to take preemptive action rather than wait and hope for the best ,  and the reasoning behind that decision was founded entirely in economic logic rather than ideology 


-  People are motivated by different things ,  observes OBrien-Bernini 


-  Some people are motivated by their personal commitment around climate change ,  others to the bottom line 


-  In my role ,   actually dont care what motivates people as long as it drives us to our goal 


-  Consider ,  for example ,  an aviation manufacturer that looked 20 years ahead to see how its market was likely to evolve 


-  They need to be inquisitive and reflective ,  asking tough questions that probe the core purpose of the organization: What are the ways in which we can profitably run our business without fear of environmental degradation or social inequity? How can we anticipate ,  influence and benefit from regulatory changes that relate to sustainability? How can we leverage sustainability to create differentiation and competitive advantage in our markets? ,  The answers to such questions will often require sustainability leaders to establish  more sophisticated  ( and frequently unconventional )  level of engagement with external stakeholders such as competitors ,  NGOs and other organizations that might well have been viewed as adversarial in the past 


-  For example ,  the leader might need to challenge the way in which investments are typically viewed by arguing for an adjustment to traditional hurdle rates when considering initiatives that would generate  significant return ,  but over  longer time period 


-  We have to  develop sustainable ,  waste-free product[s] designed for manufacturability and recyclability for tomorrow ,  says the CSO of  global high-tech company 


-  Decisions are still made in favor of the commercially optimal solution but ,  thanks to an expanded time horizon ,  the burden of up-front costs can be more substantially reduced by factoring in the long-term benefits 


-  In addition  ( and as importantly )  ,  longer time horizons force companies to consider the dangers of making decisions that benefit the short term but might provoke  consumer backlash further down the road 


-  Rather ,  the new CEO ,  Michael Thaman ,  increased the companys focus on energy efficiency ,  renewables and environmentally responsible manufacturing as key to growth 


-  Builders that want to adhere to green standards can readily determine that Owens Corning products have the necessary third-party certifications 


-  If they are considering using  competitors products that lack certification ,  they must go through the time-consuming process of proving to the NAHB that those products meet green standards 


-  Maybe its something about the cool new brand of sunscreen theyve found; or perhaps its about their disgust at the product they abandoned 


-  In the meantime ,  companies that want be around when this happens must find leaders with the right competencies to build  bridge to the future
