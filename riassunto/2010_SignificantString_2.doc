- Three teen-aged girls are at  shopping mall looking for sunscreen 


-  Its an impulse purchase ,  and it has to be an all-natural choice 


-  They think theyve found what theyre looking for at one store ,  but on the way to the register one of the girls takes out her phone and swipes it by the barcode of the product theyve selected 


-  Moments later ,  as shes pulling out  credit card at the register ,  her iPhone announces an incoming email 


-  Its  short message informing her that the item she is about to purchase contains compounds that are linked to the decimation of coral reefs 


-  Because her phone has pinpointed her location via GPS ,  she also learns that another store in the mall carries  greener sunscreen that has neither of those two problems 


-  The girls leave the register and make  beeline for the other store 


-  In fact ,  the technology needed to make it happen is already in place 


-  are developing sustainability indices; one day soon comparative product ratings will be posted next to price tags 


- com provides  free iPhone app that rates and compares tens of thousands of products on their environmental ,  health and social impacts 


-  Because of such technologies ,  the guiding principle for many companies ,  increasingly ,  is caveat venditor: let the seller beware 


-  As many markets become ever more transparent to environmentally conscious customers ,  the pursuit of sustainability will shift from  choice that companies make to  sheer necessity of survival 


-  It will affect the de facto license of  business to operate   license that customers wont hesitate to revoke 


-  ,  Many executives understand how these dynamics will fundamentally alter their businesses ,  and they understand that sustainability is ,  ultimately ,  about the sustainability of their own organizations 


-  But they often stumble in making the transition because of basic misconceptions about what it will take to transform their companies 


-  Many make the mistake of treating sustainability like any other large corporate initiative: Its actually different in several crucial ways 


-  Or they assume that it will require  steady ,  constant effort over years 


-  In fact ,  it entails three distinct phases ,  each requiring different leadership skills 


-  When implementing  business strategy that commercially incorporates sustainability ,  managers must first recognize how such efforts are unique ,  and then understand how best to advance through each major stage of  sustainability initiative 


-  Today ,  many corporations view sustainability as  strategic opportunity and are pursuing it as an operational competence 


-  The most advanced of these organizations are now thinking of sustainability as  core value  the fundamental way in which they do business 


-  To achieve that kind of transformation ,  executives must first understand the three basic ways in which sustainability is substantively different from other kinds of corporate initiatives 


-  Second ,  other initiatives tend to be unambiguously commercial decisions: costs are cut ,  target segments are expanded ,  pricing is commoditized 


-  In the case of sustainability ,  the organization frequently starts not only with an unclear picture of its potential commercial impact but also with  blurred definition of sustainability itself 


-  Third ,  other corporate initiatives  such as implementing just-in-time concepts or reorganizing from products to geographies  can generally be  part of  sustainability strategy ,  which will itself be greater in scope 


-  However ,  different initiatives pursued in concert with one another will frequently be asynchronous in their evolution 


-  Each phase relies on different levels of organizational capability and  specific set of leadership competencies on the part of the individual heading that effort 


-  ,  When an organization is largely unprepared to address sustainability ,  the key challenge is to make  clear and compelling case for change 


-  Because the organization is at best reactive to the challenges of sustainability  ( and usually unaware of the opportunities )  ,  the sustainability leader must be adept at collaborating and influencing others in the course of the transition from unconscious to conscious reactivity 


-  ,  At some point ,  nearly every company has been unconsciously reactive to sustainability 


-  The trigger has often been explicitly reflected on the C-level dashboard  ( impending regulatory action or media exposure from environmental disasters ,  for instance )  but increasingly it is rooted in more gradual trends  ( such as the growing scarcity of  key manufacturing input or the evolution of comparative product metrics )  


-  Either way ,  the organization begins to engage with sustainability but lacks  shared and consistent understanding of what it means 


-  As such ,  an important task in Phase  is the early identification of important but as yet ill-defined risks and opportunities 


-  This process can be difficult because senior executives might not yet fully appreciate the significance of the issue 


-  The thing we struggle with is engaging the general managers ,  who actually run businesses ,  says the head of sustainability at  major educational publisher 


-  The leader must communicate  compelling vision and gain buy-in from key opinion formers in the organization 


-  Leaders must help identify ,  define and develop  specific set of business processes geared to manage previously unquantified risks and capture new opportunities 


-  Consequently ,  the leader must be able to deal with ambiguity and still be effective in guiding the organization through Phase  


-  In some ways ,  the company has been environmentally friendly since 1938 ,  when it launched its first insulation product 


-  ( OBrien-Bernini would serve in  dual role as the companys head of R&D as well as chief sustainability officer ,  or CSO ,  for two years before relinquishing his R&D responsibilities altogether 


-  )  Leveraging the explicit support he had from Brown ,  OBrien-Bernini created  sustainability council composed of the most influential executives and managers at Owens Corning ,  including representatives from all businesses and functions 


-  I chose them primarily for their ability to influence the organization 


-  First ,  he wanted to maximize the impact of the council ,  and he realized that doing so required decision makers 


-  Second ,  he was aware that  as  corollary  if he merely assembled  team of tree huggers ,  the credibility of the effort would immediately be in question 


-  Third ,  he believed that having leaders of different products and geographies on the council would enhance the companys ability to cross-pollinate successful initiatives across the entire organization 


-  ,  With its sustainability council in place ,  Owens Corning began focusing on seven critical issues: energy use ,  greenhouse gases ,  particulate emissions ,  volatile organic compound  ( VOC )  emissions ,  water use ,  waste and nitrous-oxide emissions 


-  These priorities were communicated to the different plants ,  and capital was set aside for the best projects 


-  The competition fostered widespread participation to reduce energy consumption ,  decrease greenhouse gas emissions and so on 


-  It was  good deal for the plants as they realized that the best ideas across the company would get funded ,  recalls OBrien-Bernini 


-  ,  Quick wins ,  including many environmental projects that achieved payback in less than  year ,  helped convert many skeptics 


-  Others took more effort ,  as in the case of  production line that was redesigned to operate on significantly less pressure ,  which not only conserved the energy used by the air compressors but also resulted in fewer leaks and longer life for the manufacturing equipment 


-  Its  matter of collecting successes you can point to and say ,  This is making  difference ,  says OBrien-Bernini 


-  ,  Two general rules apply to these types of initial projects 


-  First ,  they need to emphasize the quantitative  ( that is ,  the bottom line )  in favor of the qualitative  ( for example ,  concepts like brand equity )  to convince skeptics of the business case 


-  One effective approach is to help grow the top line ,  for example ,  by finding buyers for substances previously considered waste  ( such as partially cured resins ,  compost or impure ethylene glycol )  


-  Consider  major home-improvement retailer that offers free haul-away of old appliances for customers who buy new ones 


-  The company has recently been exploring refurbishing those used appliances for resale in Latin America ,  where they would be more energy efficient than the older models currently in use 


-  This might be true partly because it is generally less necessary for senior leaders to collaborate than to lead change; it may also reflect these individuals preference for control 


-  The right leaders for Phase  are driven by the need to change  supporting it ,  advocating it and motivating others to initiate it 


-  Moreover ,  they know how to get the support of others by building enduring partnerships across the organization 


-  To accomplish this ,  they frame the dialogue in terms of issues that matter to managers ,  delineating the elements of sustainability that register as commercially substantive risks or rewards 


-  Now the task is to translate high-level commitments into  comprehensive change program with clearly defined initiatives and hard commercial targets 


-  To make this happen ,  sustainability leaders in Phase  must excel at delivering results ,  and they must have  strong commercial awareness 


-  At the end of this phase ,  the organization is consciously proactive on sustainability across its footprint and tracks economic ,  environmental and social metrics over the business planning cycle 


-  As such ,  the sustainability leader must display the following two competencies: results delivery and commercial orientation 


-  In addition ,  leaders must focus and prioritize efforts that generate the most value for the organization over the business planning cycle 


-  ,  The management adage what gets measured gets done strongly applies to Phase  


-  Although little data and no metrics existed before ,  there is now  concerted effort to measure and accumulate hard financial ,  environmental and social data so that the organization can make smarter decisions about various trade-offs 


-  Consider the case of  food products company in Europe 


-  Managers there introduced metrics to track the ratio of packaging material to food mass ,  and that data initially led to  discussion of whether to increase the container size for  particular product ,  which would result in proportionally less packaging 


-  But  competing metric was the amount of non-natural ingredients in that product 


-   comprehensive analysis led managers to recognize that by shrinking the container size they could do away with  class of chemical preservatives altogether because the smaller size would result in faster consumption ,  which would allow for compressed expiration dates 


-  ,  As managers of business units learn to perform these types of analyses ,  the sustainability leader can begin handing off operational responsibility to them 


-  At Owens Corning ,  the sustainability council was disbanded and responsibility was diffused to the plant managers ,  who understood the corporate goals and were encouraged to develop effective local metrics for monitoring and guiding the environmental impact and energy efficiency of their operations 


-  This could be something as simple as reducing the daily number of dumpster hauls ,   change that was made at  plant in Amarillo ,  Texas 


-  The word broken ,  for example ,  was redefined to include the notion of wasteful 


-  ,  Phase  is not simply about becoming  better corporate citizen through increased sustainability 


-  Commercial results are crucial 


-   major magazine publisher ,  for example ,  recognized that its advertisers were becoming increasingly interested in the forestry management practices of its suppliers 


-  The company now champions the fact that it has increased the amount of certified fiber used in its magazines from 20% to 80% 


-  It also had to take  hard look at its entire sustainability footprint ,  including the post-consumption of its products 


-  As  result ,  it partnered with the National Recycling Coalition Inc 


-  and launched  program that increased the amount of recycled magazines by 30% in its first year 


-  ,  Sometimes ,   deep knowledge of sustainability issues can ,  by itself ,  provide  huge competitive advantage when leveraged in the appropriate ways 


-  At Owens Corning ,   general manager of one of the businesses was working with  potential customer seeking to manufacture carbon-neutral products 


-  The GM was able to discuss those products with respect to the carbon offsets required and describe exactly what the customer would have to do to compensate for the raw materials used 


-  The ability to engage in that type of conversation not only won Owens Corning  large materials contract but also led the company to realize it could begin to use its sustainability leadership position to create differentiated value with customers 


-  ,  We have found that executives who are effective in Phase  tend to be comfortable with the distinction between the ideology of sustainability and the sustainability goals that the organization seeks to achieve 


-  These executives are motivated by commercial targets and view sustainability as one arrow in their quiver to hit those targets 


-  In the case of the magazine publisher ,  the companys increased use of certified fiber and its participation in helping to create citywide recycling programs were motivated by advertisers beginning to become concerned about placing ads in publications that had potential liabilities with respect to the environment 


-  The publisher chose to take preemptive action rather than wait and hope for the best ,  and the reasoning behind that decision was founded entirely in economic logic rather than ideology 


-  Some people are motivated by their personal commitment around climate change ,  others to the bottom line 


-  In my role ,   actually dont care what motivates people as long as it drives us to our goal 


-  This combination requires the synthesis of multiple and frequently conflicting trends to develop  coherent long-term strategy that manages trade-offs and ensures that the organization is aligned with key sustainability principles for years to come 


-  Consider ,  for example ,  an aviation manufacturer that looked 20 years ahead to see how its market was likely to evolve 


-  Industry projections had suggested that over the next two decades the number of planes in the air would increase from 18 , 000 to 36 , 000 ,  but the company decided to challenge those projections in the context of sustainability 


-  What if more airports or runways arent built? What if contiguous land masses that have high-speed rail between large cities make it illegal to fly between those metropolitan areas? What if companies need to start pricing carbon? The commercial impact is difficult to estimate ,  but its crucial to get  handle on ,  says that companys head of sustainability 


-  ,  Sustainability leaders in Phase  must evolve into futurists ,  pursuing long-term investments and partnerships that strengthen and transform organizational assets 


-  They need to be inquisitive and reflective ,  asking tough questions that probe the core purpose of the organization: What are the ways in which we can profitably run our business without fear of environmental degradation or social inequity? How can we anticipate ,  influence and benefit from regulatory changes that relate to sustainability? How can we leverage sustainability to create differentiation and competitive advantage in our markets? ,  The answers to such questions will often require sustainability leaders to establish  more sophisticated  ( and frequently unconventional )  level of engagement with external stakeholders such as competitors ,  NGOs and other organizations that might well have been viewed as adversarial in the past 


-  eliminated Styrofoam from the packaging of its fast foods ,  for example ,  it did so by partnering with the Environmental Defense Fund 


-  are now working with the EDF around initiatives designed to minimize the environmental impact of their businesses 


-  ,  In Phase  ,  the sustainability leader must often advocate for new approaches and practices that run counter to how the organization has long conducted its business 


-  For example ,  the leader might need to challenge the way in which investments are typically viewed by arguing for an adjustment to traditional hurdle rates when considering initiatives that would generate  significant return ,  but over  longer time period 


-  We have to  develop sustainable ,  waste-free product[s] designed for manufacturability and recyclability for tomorrow ,  says the CSO of  global high-tech company 


-  We couldnt do that if we had not changed the way we look at our financial model ,  because in many cases it means paying more up front for supply parts that have superior LCA [life cycle analysis] characteristics and lifetime costs 


-  Decisions are still made in favor of the commercially optimal solution but ,  thanks to an expanded time horizon ,  the burden of up-front costs can be more substantially reduced by factoring in the long-term benefits 


-  In addition  ( and as importantly )  ,  longer time horizons force companies to consider the dangers of making decisions that benefit the short term but might provoke  consumer backlash further down the road 


-  At Owens Corning ,   transition to  new CEO in 2007 did not alter the companys commitment to sustainability 


-  Rather ,  the new CEO ,  Michael Thaman ,  increased the companys focus on energy efficiency ,  renewables and environmentally responsible manufacturing as key to growth 


-  Consider how the company has been leveraging the beginnings of radical transparency in its industry by conducting life cycle analyses of its products ,  seeking third-party certifications and verifications of its claims ,  and working to influence standards-setting bodies 


-  Among other offerings ,  the program provides builders with online verification of products that have received third-party certification 


-  Owens Cornings insulation products were the first to make the list ,  and they appear first when builders click on the websites drop-down menu 


-  Builders that want to adhere to green standards can readily determine that Owens Corning products have the necessary third-party certifications 


-  If they are considering using  competitors products that lack certification ,  they must go through the time-consuming process of proving to the NAHB that those products meet green standards 


-  Having the right products is an important first step says OBrien-Bernini ,  then making your products easy to specify elevates your competitive edge 


-  But the point here is not that information transparency is  serendipitous benefit that can result from  sustainability initiative 


-  ,  This brings us back to the mall ,  where the three teen-aged girls have just purchased another brand of sunscreen at  different store 


-  Maybe its something about the cool new brand of sunscreen theyve found; or perhaps its about their disgust at the product they abandoned 


-  ,  So ,  to paraphrase the novelist William Gibson ,  the future is already here; its just not distributed evenly yet 


-  Today ,  young consumers like these teenagers are buying products ,  intuitively using an emerging set of tools 


-  ,  And while theyre buying products today ,  they will be running businesses tomorrow 


-  In the meantime ,  companies that want be around when this happens must find leaders with the right competencies to build  bridge to the future
