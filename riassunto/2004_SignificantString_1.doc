-  The reason:  superficial understanding of what customer focus really means 


-  ,  Deep customer focus is not about buying customer-relationship-management software that tracks customers purchases 


-  Would you rather have ,  say ,   new health plan with new features or would you rather have  relationship with  health-insurance company that is committed to solving pretty much all your health and safety problems  an organization that not only provides insurance coverage but ,  for example ,  also helps with your health- and safety-related concerns so that problems are caught before they happen and dont get unnecessarily serious or costly even as you get older? Thats the kind of company Denmarks International Health Insurance  ( IHI )  ,  operating in 150 countries ,  became 


-  might not call its approach deep customer focus ,  but IBM did more than turn to services when mainframes werent selling and PCs were commoditizing: It embedded in its culture  worker mind-set focused on outcomes for customers 


-  They had no sense of participating in  market space to enable professionals to make better decisions ,  quicker or in  high-level decision-support management market space ,  the term the company finally chose 


-  ,  The tool that supports the value-identifying stage is the customer-activity cycle 


-  Using it ,   team is able to look methodically at the activities customers go through to achieve an outcome ,  uncover the gaps  ( the activities customers could or should go through )  and fill those gaps with whatever will lead to the desired customer outcome 


-  The country manager at Baxter Healthcare Germany successfully defined  new market space ,  but it was only when the customer-activity cycle revealed precisely what patients needed pre ,  during and post surgery that Baxter could specify what services it would have to offer patients and who would provide each service 


-  The commercial-transport unit of BP Plc ,  for example ,  wanted to become indispensable to hauling companies in its newly articulated market space ,  integrated energy and environmental management 


-  Through the customer-activity-cycle tool ,  BPs team discovered that in the during stage ,  when truckers were transporting goods ,  their drivers kept the engines running for warmth while they slept 


-  ,  The customer-activity cycle not only identifies the value propositions that can make  company indispensable ,  it also lets the company build detail-rich stories to promote the offerings both internally and externally 


-  Stories are more powerful than business plans and more beneficial to enterprises going through  deep-customer-focus change process 


-  It included the rich details that emerged from using the customer-activity cycle 


-  ,  The next breakthrough occurs when deep-customer-focus companies like LexisNexis see how much they can improve their numbers 


-  The customer-activity cycle helped LexisNexis gauge the size of the gaps it could fill if customers could have up-to-the-minute databases that LexisNexis built ,  fed into customer routines ,  updated and maintained to allow users to ask better questions and get better answers instead of using slow manual or electronic-imaging sources 


-  ,  Sizing the prize also involves understanding that customers who buy new offerings build stronger working relationships with  company and often increase their purchases of existing offerings 


-  The only realistic way to evaluate deep-customer-focus benefits is over time ,  the way other corporate assets are evaluated 


-   full-blown demonstration of the customer-activity cycle gives customers  chance to validate the value propositions and indicate what they see as hot spots ,  or critical areas 


-  ,  Some companies ,  however ,  regard modeling as an investment 


-  Closed ,  silolike structures ,  mentalities and behaviors cannot produce the desired customer outcomes 


-  Then teams began to consider themselves responsible for  customer-lifestyle outcome 


-  Lexis-Nexis asked one customer group ,  insurance-claims assessors ,  What do you consider success? and found out that success meant increasing the number of frauds detected and the amount of money recovered 


-  And to broaden understanding and acceptance of the concept ,  IHI invests in collaboration with leading global corporations and health experts on research ,  forums and publications ,  benefiting customers and company alike 


-  ,  Such investments fill gaps in the customer-activity cycle ,  enabling quicker ,  better results 


-  IBM made  considerable investment by acquiring the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers  ( PwC )  


-  Thus ,  in the gather-momentum stage of the process ,  the key concern of executives should not be ,  Do we own it? but rather ,  Do we understand how to do it? and ,  Are we using ,  reusing and updating our knowledge? ,  The trick is to capture knowledge gleaned from behavior or encounters unique to an individual customer and then reuse it by consolidating the findings and transferring the relevant pieces to other customers 


-  LexisNexis ,  for one ,  continuously observes customer behavior to track how users link information in their decision-making processes 


-  Thus HSC seeks to understand in minute detail which region is getting the best results  which nurse is getting the best results with which patient ,  why and how? The best practices are then disseminated across the enterprise and constantly updated ,  allowing HSC to maintain its lead as the standard in the market
