-  What is also required is the acknowledgment that governance has to continually adapt to changing conditions because  company ,  its management and business environment are forever evolving 


-  Specifically ,  the markets would weed out and penalize  through declining share prices and takeovers  executives who tried to manipulate their companies in any way that was adverse to long-term value creation 


-  Everything affecting value creation  ( including environmental costs such as pollution )  would be priced by the markets and rewarded or punished in line with the contribution to or subtraction from value creation that those factors engendered 


-  ,  Indeed ,  if the market could capture everything and no one could manipulate decision making with monopoly power ,  companies that maximized their economic value  ( the difference between projected revenues and the market cost of all the resources used )  would also maximize the public good 


-  Thus ,  governance is necessary to deal with the things that fall outside markets as well as the people who would manipulate decisions in their own interests 


-  ,  Two broad streams of commentary and research deal with these issues and the need for different governance roles 


-  Sociologists have explored the role and impact of companies on society ,  especially the relationships between organizations and other stakeholder groups 


-  Markets alone do not capture the full impact of companies; in particular ,  they do not price certain inputs and outputs of the business ,  so-called externalities ,  such as the effect of an organizations activities on society at large 


-  Thus ,  regulations and governance are needed to deal with the consequences of those externalities ,  especially those promoted by stakeholder groups 


-  But the right role of the board depends on the importance of the externalities ,  which can vary from country to country and from market to market over the life of the company 


-  ,  Economists have explored how shareholders can get managers to run  company as agents acting in the owners interests ,  given the appropriate regulations and incentives 


-  Inside an organization ,  top managers pursue power and wealth; outside the company ,  directors ,  shareholders ,  regulators ,  unions ,  nongovernmental organizations  ( NGOs )  and governments want influence 


-  Each side inevitably tries to distort the governance system to its advantage ,  but managers have the advantage of their monopoly on power and access to inside information 


-  Thus the right role of the board depends on the importance of the agency problems ,  the difficulty of getting managers to act in the owners interests ,  which can vary over the life of the company ,  and the tenure of each CEO 


-  ,  To deal with externalities and agency problems ,  boards have an ongoing portfolio of activities ,  including auditing ,  oversight mechanisms ,  company policies ,  compensation incentives ,  succession planning and so on 


-  But boards are influenced by economic ,  sociocultural ,  psychological and political forces ,  which each have their own separate ,  independent dynamics 


-  At any period in time ,  to avoid confusion and to pursue  direction in dealing with the current conditions facing the organization ,  boards must emphasize  particular subset of activities in decision making and resource allocation 


-  ,  The driving governance role must change with shifts in the importance and nature of the externalities that shape the agendas of shareholders and stakeholders ,  as well as with shifts in the agency problems created by dysfunctional managerial power 


-  See Sidebar ,  Because information can never be fully transparent ,  boards always have the fundamental fiduciary responsibility of auditing the financial performance of companies to ensure that they are being run in the interests of their owners 


-  ,  However ,  when markets are not efficient and well regulated ,  boards have to deal with the factors that fall outside the markets and regulations 


-  If the externalities are excluded and ignored ,  they may come back to undermine the long-run economic performance of the company 


-  ,  The boards of companies active in emerging economies have to take an even broader view of their oversight and policy responsibility because value creation in emerging markets requires  wider range of company activities than in the developed world 


-  ,  The board has to develop oversight and policy standards to ensure that management puts in place local rules of corporate governance both to address the inadequacies in the external environment and to avoid compromising the long-term future of the company 


-  Oversight of societal impact and ethical standards are essential ,  for example ,  to prevent the type of externalities that have confronted Nike Inc 


-  ,  Markets in transition ,  such as recently deregulated markets or those created by new technology ,  also require  broader governance perspective than that dictated by short-term market forces 


- s collapse was due to woefully inadequate governance oversight and policies for dealing with the long-term risk in the new derivative markets that the company created 


-  While Enron was inappropriately pricing the long-term risks it was taking on ,  some of its customers in the deregulated electricity market in the United States skimped on investing in new capacity and faced an embarrassing series of power outages 


-  In these cases ,  governance oversight and policies were too narrowly focused on short-term financial auditing and ignored the longer-term impact of inadequate risk management and investment 


-  ,  Influential NGOs often emerge in response to externalities with negative societal impacts that are either unpriced by the market or are perceived to be inadequately regulated 


-  The activism of NGOs signals that companies need to broaden their governance perspective and develop policies for engaging with the NGOs 


-  And Shell completely discounted the impact of the NGOs that protested the proposed disposal of the Brent Spar oil rig in the North Sea 


-  ,  When managerial power is effective ,  in the sense that it promotes the creation of long-term economic value and does not manipulate the way that value gets shared ,  the board can restrict its activity to monitoring the value-creating performance of the company and developing policy to govern the distribution of value to shareholders and other stakeholders 


-  ,  However ,  when managerial power is dysfunctional ,  in the sense that it either does not promote value creation or it manipulates the distribution of value to its advantage ,  the board has to become more involved 


-  The most common examples include contexts in which performance is poor ,  either financially or in dealing with externalities; the CEO makes major strategic moves unilaterally  ( that is ,  without consulting the board )  ethical or transparency standards are breached; or the CEO asks for excessive compensation that is not linked to performance 


-  ,  Dealing with poor performance or major unilateral moves is  special challenge when it involves long-serving CEOs whose early performance had been good 


-  The passive role of GMs board during the decades after World War II is  classic example of the difficulty of reversing course ,  even when major externalities and poor performance become evident 


-  ,  When GM finally woke up to the challenge of new competition in the 1980s ,  the board did nothing to prevent managements drive to spend $90 billion on new high technology and acquisitions that could not be digested organizationally 


-  He withheld key financial data and budget allocation proposals until the day before the meetings and sometimes distributed them minutes before the participants convened 


-  Past research has found that CEOs with weak boards of directors tend to receive greater compensation than CEOs with powerful boards 


-  The increasing concern among shareholders over the distribution of value is putting pressure on boards to get involved sooner to constrain the violation of ethical standards and the manipulation of value distribution 


-  )  The roles reflect two main differences in board culture 


-  First ,  boards can be concerned mainly with shareholder interests ,  or they can also take into account the interests of other stakeholders to deal with important externalities 


-  Second ,  boards can restrict their activities to monitoring ,  or they can be involved in the conduct of the organization at the top to deal with ineffective management 


-  ,  When management is effective and externalities are insignificant ,  boards should assume an auditing role 


-  The dominant activity here is the fundamental fiduciary responsibility of monitoring company performance in the interests of the shareholders 


-  Competitive markets and efficient regulations are sufficient to handle all significant externalities ,  and top management is effective in creating and distributing value 


-  Also ,  the perspective is focused and short term 


-  ,  An auditing role is appropriate in stable business environments that do not require large investments or big moves with high external impact 


-  Such conditions are common ,  for example ,  when small and midsize businesses have effective CEOs ,  are not growing rapidly and are not big enough to generate nonmarket effects that may eventually undermine long-run economic performance 


-  ,  When externalities are important ,  the board can still limit itself to  monitoring role if management is effective 


-  But the perspective of the board has to go well beyond its fiduciary responsibility to incorporate oversight and policy for the strategic ,  societal and risk effects of those externalities 


-  Although the financial audit committee still must play an important role ,  other board committees have to take the lead in supervising managements response to issues of social responsibility ,  long-term strategy and risk management 


-  Thus ,  the mix of board members has to shift to include experts who can deal with such concerns 


-  And most importantly ,  the decision-making criteria have to include multiple objectives ,  especially the ability to make trade-offs between short-term financial performance and longer-term value creation ,  and those trade-offs should continually incorporate feedback from the externalities 


-  All of this amounts to  basic shift in the culture of the board to what can be called  supervising role 


-  ,   supervising role is appropriate when  large ,  powerful company with effective management makes strategic moves that create value over the long run but have significant risks or have an impact on society outside the companys markets 


-  The supervising role is especially important when  company is considering big moves; it is essential for high-risk businesses with strong ,  effective CEOs who are involved in deal making and large investments 


-  ,  When the CEO and other top executives are ineffective in creating value or when they manipulate value distribution to their advantage ,  the board has to move from  monitoring role to more active involvement 


-  When the externalities are insignificant ,  the board can restrict its perspective to  focused short-term view ,  dealing with the CEO and the top team 


-  ,  To do so ,  the board has to change the power balance and establish its independence from the CEO with the independent leadership of outside directors or by splitting the roles of CEO and chairman of the board 


-  In fact ,  coaching is often the primary function of boards that appoint  new CEO from outside the company 


-  ,  When management is ineffective and the business is affected by  number of nonmarket factors ,  the board has to go beyond either coaching or supervising and become actively involved in execution with  broad ,  long-term perspective 


-  It calls for the ability to interact ,  negotiate and possibly lead combined working groups with outside stakeholders 


-  Ultimately ,  the board might also have to ensure the implementation of the companys agreements with those stakeholders 


-  The task requires deft people skills and  keen sense of the politics of public groups and coalitions 


-  ,  The right driving role does not remain static but evolves with changes in the externalities in the market and the agency problems created by ineffective management 


-  ,  Three types of patterns are commonly associated with the emergence of new externalities: economic and political cycles ,  industry and business-model shifts and organizational crises 


-  For  good example of those factors at play ,  consider the story of the collapse of Swissair 


-  The Swissair board included many of the most respected CEOs of large Swiss multinationals ,  as well as personalities from the public sector 


-  In the late 1980s and 1990s ,  none of the board members had  background in the airline industry 


-  As one who later became chairman put it ,  I am not  friend of the notion that at the board level one should in  way duplicate the management requirements 


-  Management has the know-how to lead the airline 


-  ,  In 1987 ,  the European Commission introduced  three-phase deregulation of the airline industry in Europe ,  which led to the emergence of low-cost competitors like Ryanair ,  easyJet Airline and Virgin Express 


-  Not surprisingly ,  given its history and composition ,  the Swissair board made no move away from its dominant monitoring role toward more of  supervisory one ,  and instead of responding directly to the shift in industry conditions ,  it pursued its global ambitions by joining Delta Air Lines and Singapore Airlines Ltd 


-  ,  In December 1992 ,  the Swiss population voted against joining the European Common Market ,  and Swissair feared being locked out of that market 


-  Within  few months ,  the company announced plans to set up  jointly owned entity ,  to be known as Alcazar ,  with Scandinavian Airlines System  ( SAS )  ,  KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Austrian Airlines 


-  But the agreement failed at the end of 1993 ,  with concerns among the Swiss public and parliament about massive layoffs and the loss of Swissairs identity 


-  Rather than play an active steering role in dealing with those stakeholder concerns ,  though ,  the Swissair board was still trapped in its traditional monitoring role 


-  ,  Swissairs management proposed  radical shift in business model toward becoming  network manager 


-  In that capacity ,  the airline would perform the brain function of an alliance ,  integrating network and product design ,  scheduling ,  yield ,  pricing ,  brand management and sales ,  while purchasing both flying and nonflying services from other providers 


- 10 This strategy involved taking equity stakes in national or regional carriers ,  so Swissair borrowed to take  49 


- 5% stake in Sabena ,  the ailing Belgian national airline 


-  In the absence of coaching from the board but working with McKinsey ,  Bruggisser proceeded with the network-manager strategy ,  reorganizing the company into  holding structure ,  called the SAir Group ,  with four divisions: SAirLines ,  SAirLogistics ,  SAirServices and SAirRelations 


-  He produced  good profit performance in 1997 ,  which the media touted ,  and he deftly managed the company throughout the tragic Swissair crash off the coast of Halifax in 1998 


-  To accelerate implementation of the network-manager objective ,  Bruggisser carried out McKinseys recommendation of  hunter strategy ,  taking minority investments of up to 30% in  German tour operator ,  LTU; three small French airlines ,  AOM ,  Air Libert and Air Littoral; LOT Polish Airlines; and the South African national airline ,  SAA 


- 11 Except for LOT ,  the airlines involved were in poor financial shape 


-  On the advice of management ,  the board approved these investments for  total of  


-  ,  But differences at the top between Bruggisser ,  who was CEO of SAir Group  ( the holding company )  ,  and Jeffrey Katz ,  then CEO of Swissair ,  over the personal ambitions of Katz ,  who had come from American Airlines ,  led to the collapse of  potential partnership with American 


-  With the board far from playing the necessary coaching role ,  Bruggisser then proceeded on his own to explore  full merger with Alitalia Airlines ,  which required additional investment 


-  ,  However ,  when McKinsey produced  report in August 2000 showing that an additional  


- 45 billion francs would be needed ,   new member of the board ,  Mario Corti ,  the CFO of Nestl ,  started asking detailed questions that exposed the fragility of the companys financial position 


-  The hunter strategy was scuttled; Bruggissers 22-year career came to an end; and the chairman of the board ,  Eric Honegger ,  became the interim CEO 


-  ,  But the story doesnt end there 


-  billion francs  ( due to  write-off of investments in other airlines and provisions for financial obligations assumed with those deals )  as well as an increase in debt from 13 billion to 19 billion francs  ( due to the recognition of previously off-balance-sheet financing )  


-  The directors received the financial figures every month and met every other month to evaluate the performance of the SAir Group 


-  Working closely with management ,  the board introduced initiatives to sell noncore businesses ,  such as the hotels and stakes in the other airlines 


-  21 ,  2001 ,  Moodys downgraded the companys debt to junk status 


-  When suppliers demanded immediate reimbursements ,  the company couldnt pay for jet fuel 


-  ,   striking thing about the Swissair story is the way in which the board never came close to  supervisory role despite the increasing risk of the hunter strategy 


-  The board remained passive even when problems became manifest on the front pages of the press ,  as the partner airline unions balked at the network strategy 


-  McKinsey had much to lose in client fees if it were to recommend that Swissairs management drop the increasingly risky network-manager and hunter strategies 


-  ,  Swissairs story might provide  stunning example of  boards failure ,  but the governance issues the airline faced are hardly unique 


-  Several measures can help boards to preempt similar kinds of problems 


-  To pick up changes in externalities ,  it has to delegate that responsibility to individual members or subcommittees ,  as the need requires ,  so that they can monitor the societal impact of the companys activities as well as determine the longer-term strategic and risk effects 


-  The board also has to set aside some time on its agenda to discuss those topics ,  and it should request periodic reports both from the designated members  ( to determine how political ,  economic and industry events are affecting externalities )  as well as from management  ( to assess the impact of industry ,  business-model and organizational changes )  


-  They can do so only by meeting periodically without the CEO and those directors who have ties to the company 


-  Their report back to the full board should include an evaluation of the performance of the CEO and the top-management team in terms of value creation ,  ethics and transparency ,  as well as an assessment of how the boards policies are affecting the long-term health of the company 


-  The purpose is to determine the appropriate balance in the distribution of power between top management and the independent external directors and to ascertain that the right governance roles are driving board deliberations and supporting the value-creating model of the company in sync with the business environment 


-  ,  The most difficult task  and therefore the one most likely to benefit from the help of outsiders  is the assessment of the dominant governance role ,  in terms of the culture of decision making ,  resource allocation and board action 


-  Is that culture one of financial monitoring  ( auditing role )  ,  or multiple objectives and policy trade-offs between the short and long run  ( supervising role )  ,  or involvement with the CEOs development  ( coaching role )  ,  or active board initiatives to offset weaknesses in the top-management team ,  especially in managing externalities  ( steering role )  ,  The key to preempting governance problems is the ability of the board to shift its dominant role early enough to deal with emerging issues 


-  In addition to anticipation ,  this calls for role flexibility ,  which can be enhanced in several ways 


-  have recently moved toward having  majority of outsiders with diverse backgrounds on their boards 


-  ,  have organized for independent leadership of their outside directors 


-  ,  Third ,  boards that have the resources should develop  range of activities tied to different board members or subcommittees: oversight of strategic ,  societal and risk effects; policies for ethics ,  transparency and compensation; processes for succession planning; coaching and so on 


-  ,  Finally ,  because human beings are generally not adept at self-evaluation and monitoring ,   recommended practice is for boards to file an annual report to describe how they are dealing with externalities and agency problems 


-  This document might be submitted to the annual general meeting of shareholders as well as to  public agency ,  such as the Securities and Exchange Commission 


-  At the very least ,  this practice will encourage boards to take  more active role in monitoring and governing themselves as well as the organizations they oversee
