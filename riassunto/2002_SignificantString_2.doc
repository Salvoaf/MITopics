-  The great majority of them ,  however ,  are adept at producing only sustaining innovations  products or services that meet the demands of existing customers in established markets 


-  Few companies have introduced genuinely disruptive innovations ,  the kind that result in the creation of entirely new markets and business models 


-  And yet the motivation to pursue such innovations should be urgent 


-  In almost any industry you care to examine ,  the most dramatic stories of growth and success were launched from  platform of disruptive innovation 


-  ,  Most managers understand that significant ,  new ,  sustainable growth comes from creating new markets and ways of competing 


-  Why? Because when times are good and core businesses are growing robustly ,  starting new generations of growth ventures seems unnecessary; when times are bad and mature businesses are under attack ,  investments to create new growth businesses cant send enough profit to the bottom line quickly enough to satisfy investor pressure for  fast turnaround 


-  Our research indicates that if senior managers pursue this path  and if the growth businesses they start or acquire are truly disruptive  companies will find it less difficult and risky than many have supposed to create wave after wave of new growth 


-  ( To have  truer sense of whether  disruptive strategy may work in the future ,  its at least as important to understand what hasnt worked as what has 


-  As  result ,  we have devised two sets of litmus tests that senior managers can use to shape business plans to improve their chances of success 


-  Our research suggests that any proposal must pass at least one set of tests if project investments are to have  chance of paying off 


-  We conclude by outlining the process any company will need to institute if it wants to create an engine capable of building new disruptive businesses over and over again 


-  Although the task is far from simple ,  it can be done 


-  ,  The dichotomy between sustaining and disruptive innovations has been discussed in various contexts since Clayton Christensen first wrote about it in 1993 


-  For the purposes of this article ,  its important to bear in mind the following essential elements of the theory: ,  All ideas for new products and businesses emerge from innovators minds only partially formed 


-  They typically hesitate to throw their weight behind new product concepts whose market is not assured ,  fearing that their reputation for good judgment may be compromised 


-  As  consequence ,  the normal corporate process for shaping and funding ideas turns them into sustaining innovations that target large ,  obvious markets 


-  ,  Many of the ideas that end up as sustaining innovations could just as readily have been shaped into disruptive business plans ,  given  distinctly different process and managers who understood how to use it 


-  The first requires the creation of  new market that can serve as  base for disruption; the second is based on disruption of the prevailing business model from the low end 


-  ,  Companies seeking to create disruptive growth should first search for ways to compete against nonconsumption: peoples inability to use available products or services because they are too expensive or too complicated 


-  Its much easier to target potential customers who arent buying at all than to steal customers from an entrenched competitor 


-  Strategies that disrupt by creating new market applications for entirely new customers should meet the following three litmus tests 


-  ,  Test #1: Does the innovation target customers who in the past havent been able to do it themselves for lack of money or skills? ,  Many of the most successful disruptive growth businesses have given people direct access to products or services that had been too expensive or too complex for the mainstream 


-  For example ,  until the late 1970s computer jobs had to be processed by specialists in the corporate mainframe-computer center 


-  Today ,  ordinary people with PCs can handle problems that are far more complex than the ones mainframes used to solve 


-  Disruption pulled new users into the computer market by the millions ,  as the PC allowed people to compute conveniently for themselves 


-  The innovation may succeed in satisfying some customers ,  but it wont create significant new growth 


-  There just isnt  large population of nonconsumers who can be pulled into the market for bank accounts by Internet banking 


-  Because it cant meet this litmus test ,  online banking can be only  sustaining innovation that helps retail banks serve  segment of their existing customer base  bit more profitably and effectively 


-  New entrants are unlikely to be able to use the technology to disrupt established banks  ( unless they can conceive  strategy that passes the second set of litmus tests )  


-  ,  In contrast ,  online retail stock brokers such as E*Trade and Charles Schwab did have the potential to create  new disruptive growth market because they could enable  new set of customers  day traders  to speculate; in addition ,  they made trading so simple and inexpensive that people of relatively low net worth could begin to manage their own portfolios without the help of professionals 


-  Because these companies were initially competing against nonconsumption rather than Merrill Lynch ,  they could create  new wave of disruptive growth 


-  ,  Test #2: Is the innovation aimed at customers who will welcome  simple product? ,  If the innovation enables  new population of customers to consume for themselves ,  it can more easily be shaped to pass the second litmus test: The disruptive product must be technologically straightforward ,  targeted at customers who will be happy with  simple product 


-  Because corporate funding processes compel disruptive innovators to quantify the magnitude and certitude of the opportunity ,  potential disruptions are force-fit into obvious ,  measurable ,  existing market applications 


-  That leads corporate managers to hope for growth from improbable sources; more seriously ,  it pits innovators disruptive technology against  sustaining technology already in use by entrenched competitors 


-  The disruptive products performance must then surpass technologies on the sustaining trajectory ,  which is equivalent to killing off the product 


-  Cramming disruptions into established markets is very expensive and always fails 


-  ,  Successful disruptive innovators always target customers who welcome simple products 


-  Apple marketed its Apple II as  toy for children ,  while Xerox was misguidedly determined to use the same technology to automate the office 


-  Palms Pilot was  simple organizer ,  whereas Apple  ( having become the industry incumbent )  positioned its Newton as  handheld computer 


-  Today ,  NTT DoCoMo and its Japanese competitors have signed up 40 million profitable subscribers for their wireless Internet-access systems by making it easy for teenagers to download ring tones and wallpaper and by providing simple games to help young commuters kill time 


-  Their European and American counterparts ,  in contrast ,  are struggling to provide the bandwidth and screen size that will enable existing customers to do the same things on  phone that they do today on  computer; and because wireless access isnt as good as wireline access for these applications ,  they have no profitable customers 


-  Similarly ,  voice recognition technology is taking off in applications involving simple phrases ,  but IBMs ViaVoice product is designed to replace keyboard word processing and leaves users deeply dissatisfied 


-  ,  It is important to note that in each of those cases ,  the targeted application ,  product and customer set were not foreordained by the technology 


-  The divergent targets resulted from differences in the idea-shaping processes used by established companies and new entrants 


-  ,  Test #3: Will the innovation help customers do more easily and effectively what they are already trying to do? ,  This test requires innovators to keep in mind one essential fact: At  fundamental level ,  the things that people want to accomplish in their lives dont change quickly 


-  Because of this stability ,  if an idea for  new growth business is predicated on customers wanting to do something that hadnt been  priority in the past ,  it stands little chance of success 


-  ,  Lets illustrate this test by exploring the potential for digital imaging to disrupt the market for photographic film 


-  How do most people use photographic film? When theyve finished shooting  roll ,  they drop off the film at the developers ,  frequently ordering double prints so that copies of the best shots will be readily available to send to friends or relatives 


-  When the prints are ready ,  people bring them home ,  flip through them ,  put them back into the envelope ,  and put the envelope into  box or drawer 


-  ,  The digital-imaging companies approached amateur photographers with interesting propositions: If youll just take the time to learn how to use this software ,  you can edit out the red-eye in all those flash pictures and You can now keep all your pictures neatly arranged in online photo albums 


-  Digital camera users do send more images to more people over the Internet  the new technology lets people do more easily what they were trying to do in ordering double prints from film 


-  And the recipients of the images typically view them once ,  close the box and put the pictures into an envelope on the hard drive 


-  ,  Despite its disruptive potential ,  digital imaging hasnt created the major wave of new growth that digital film and camera companies so desperately need 


-  Theyve concentrated on making products that can deliver images as sharp as those caught on photographic film 


-  Because the technology they are using to capture sharper images is expensive ,  they have also violated test #1: The equipment isnt cheap enough to appeal to existing camera owners ,  most of whom are satisfied with the pictures they get from photographic film 


-  Had they instead built their cameras with cheap sensors ,  whose sharpness is more than adequate for images viewed on computer screens ,  they could have hit price points low enough to have competed against nonconsumption  selling fun ,  not cameras ,  to teenagers and children ,  who use the Internet with extraordinary creativity 


-  Whether that happens after  brutal ,  feature-for-feature fight involving sustaining technology  or after  huge new growth market is created among  new set of customers who have found new ways and reasons for consuming images depends on whether the companies in this space shape their strategies to create disruptive growth or allow the default settings of sustaining strategy to determine their targets 


-  ,  Some ideas for innovative products simply cant be shaped to pass the first set of tests 


-   quite different strategy  disrupting the industry leaders business model  also harnesses the power of asymmetric motivation 


-  ,   proposal that cannot compete against nonconsumption necessarily aims at the same markets dominated by industry leaders 


-  First ,  it must target the least-demanding tiers of  market in which prevailing products are so good they overserve customers 


-  In other words ,  there must be less demanding customers who would happily buy  good-enough product that is cheaper than those currently available 


-  Second ,  the product must be made and marketed within  disruptive business model ,  one that enables the entrant to compete profitably while pricing at deep discounts 


-  Managers who shape  strategy to conform to these litmus tests can successfully create  new growth business within an existing market 


-  ,  Test #1: Are prevailing products more than good enough? ,  If available products arent yet good enough ,   disruptive innovation whose performance is even lower will not gain any traction in the market 


-  Mobile telephone networks probably fall into the category of not yet good enough to be disrupted with this strategy; many pharmaceutical products also fit this description 


-  For example ,  synthetic insulin that is free of impurities couldnt disrupt the market for insulin made from  pigs pancreas  ( which contains some impurities )  because neither is effective enough to counteract the long-term effects of Type  diabetes 


-  ,  Managers who are shaping  disruptive strategy can determine when  products performance has overshot what customers can use by examining rigorously ,  market tier by market tier ,  the extent to which customers are willing to pay premium prices for further improvements in the functionality ,  reliability or convenience of  product or service 


-  If companies can sustain price increases in  given tier when they introduce an improvement in one of these areas ,  customers are not yet overserved and that tier cannot be disrupted 


-  In the late 1990s ,  hundreds of millions of dollars were invested to create exchanges for commodities such as steel; their objective was to disrupt traditional distribution enterprises 


-  The vast majority of the worlds steel ,  however ,  is not purchased at the lowest price the buyer can find 


-  Steel buyers quite consistently pay premium prices to be assured of reliable supplies from their distributors 


-  The prevalence of the price premiums indicates that buyers are not yet overserved on the dimension of reliability and thus the market could not be disrupted by the online exchanges 


-  ,  Test #2: Can you create  different business model? ,  If the low end of  market is overserved and thus open to disruption ,  the second test requires managers to craft  new business model; the business must be able to earn attractive returns at prices that can steal business at the low end 


-   disruptive business model consists of  cost structure ,  operating processes and  distribution system in which profit margins are thinner but net asset turns are higher 


-  It creates the asymmetric motivation needed for disruptive success 


-  Discount retailers such as Wal-Mart and Kmart attacked the low end of the market  nationally branded hard goods such as paint ,  hardware ,  kitchen utensils ,  toys and sporting goods that were so commonplace they could sell themselves 


-  The low end of this market was over-served by department stores; customers did not need well-trained salespeople to help them get what they needed 


-  The discounters business model enabled them to make money at gross margins of about 23% 


-  ,  For good reasons ,  full-service retailers ceded the low end of the market to the discounters 


-  At the time discount retailers attacked the low end of their merchandise mix ,  managers of full-service stores could have defended the branded hard-goods businesses ,  which the discounters were attacking with prices that were 20% below those of department stores 


-  But competing against the discounters by matching their prices would have sent margins plummeting to 23% ,  and ,  given the three-times-per-year inventory turns inherent in their business model ,  ROCII would have dropped to about 70% 


-  Clearly ,  it made sense for the full-service department stores to get out of the tiers of the market that the discounters were motivated to enter 


-  Discount retailers subsequently were motivated to move further upmarket into the lowest-margin tiers of clothing ,  home furnishings and cosmetics 


-  ,  This is the sort of asymmetry of motivation that managers need to create if they hope to build  successful new growth business within the same market served by industry leaders 


-  To do that ,  managers must start by asking: How much lower does our price need to be to penetrate the lowest tier of the market? What do our costs need to be to generate profits at that price level? How could we change our asset turns and operating processes to achieve attractive returns? ,  If  hopeful entrant cant define  business model with high-enough asset turns to earn attractive returns on low margins ,  it wont be able to attract the repeated capital investments required to sustain the upmarket march inherent in building  business 


-  As we have reviewed business plans requesting corporate funds for new product development ,  we have been dismayed to see how few of the plans developers have devised business models that can sustain  disruptive enterprise 


-  Steel minimills such as Nucor have used this strategy to beat the integrated steel companies like Bethlehem ,  and online travel agencies are using it to disrupt full-service agencies 


-  ,  Executives who are shaping  low-end disruptive business-model strategy need to be sure it is unattractive to every powerful incumbent 


-  The Internet helped Medco make more money in the way it was already structured to make money; and because Medco had far more resources to throw at the opportunity than startups did ,  it outdistanced the startups and drove them from the market 


-  ,  To get  sense of how managers might use the litmus tests to shape an idea into  disruptive business plan ,  lets examine whether Xerox could disrupt Hewlett-Packards ink-jet printing business 


-  We dont actually know if Xerox has considered this possibility ,  and we use the companies names only to make the example more vivid 


-  What can the company do with it? It could attempt to leapfrog ahead of Hewlett-Packard by producing the best ink-jet printer on the market 


-  Could Xerox craft  disruptive strategy for this technology? Well use the litmus tests for the disruptive business model strategy first 


-  ,  To assess whether  low-end strategy is viable ,  Xeroxs managers should examine whether customers in each tier of the market are willing to pay price premiums for improvements in performance  faster printers that produce sharper images 


-  It appears ,  however ,  that consumers in less demanding tiers are increasingly indifferent to improvements 


-  So the first litmus test is met: It does seem that  set of customers would be willing to buy  good enough printer that is cheaper than prevailing products 


-  ,  The next litmus test is whether Xerox could define  business model that would generate attractive returns at the discounted prices required to win business at the low end 


-  H-P and other printer companies already out-source the fabrication and assembly of components to the lowest-cost sources in the world 


-  They make all their money selling ink cartridges 


-  Xerox could enter the market by selling ink cartridges at lower prices ,  but unless it could define processes that would allow it to do so profitably ,  any lead it gained initially would be unsustainable 


-  ,  Is there  large ,  untapped population of computer users who dont have the skills to operate current printers or the money to buy one? Probably not 


-  Hewlett-Packard and its competitors already competed successfully against nonconsumption when they launched their easy-to-use ,  inexpensive ink-jet printers to disrupt expensive laser printers 


-  ,  Could Xerox use its technology to help customers do something more easily that they are already trying to do? Is there  low-performance product that people would happily buy? Quite possibly 


-  Documents created on notebook computers are not easy to print 


-  Notebook users have to find  stationary printer and either hook its cable to the computer or transfer the file to  desktop PC via floppy disk in order to get paper copies 


-  If Xerox incorporated  simple ,  inexpensive printer into the base or back of  notebook computer so that users on the go could get hard copies when they needed them ,  where they needed them ,  the company could probably win customers even if the printer wasnt as good as  stationary ink jet 


-  In this case ,  we would expect H-P to ignore the notebook-printer opportunity at the outset because of the other options competing for resources within H-Ps huge printer business ,  which needs large chunks of new revenue to sustain its growth 


-  To create as much asymmetry as possible ,  Xerox would also want to develop  business model that was attractive to Xerox but unattractive to H-P 


-  This might entail pricing ink cartridges for embedded notebook printers at levels that would send H-P scurrying upmarket ,  in search of the larger profits generated by higher-performance stationary printers 


-  In this context ,  we use the term values to mean the criteria that people employ when making both big and small decisions  when giving priority to one set of activities over another 


-  Such choices can be the kiss of death ,  however ,  because the kinds of challenges that will confront managers in building  new disruptive enterprise are radically different from those that most would have grappled with in the core business 


-  The counterintuitive point is that managers whom corporate leaders have learned to trust because of their success in the mainstream business probably cannot be counted on to lead  radical new venture 


-  ,  To choose the right managers to lead  new venture ,  its useful to construct  three-column chart 


-  In the middle column ,  list the experiences the managers should already have had ,  to be certain they have the perspective to succeed 


-  ,  Thus in the left column ,  Xeroxs managers might note that customers for the built-in printer probably would not know at the outset what features theyd need or when or how they would actually use the product 


-  In the middle column ,  they would specify  manager who had successfully and unsuccessfully introduced new products in  fluid ,  emerging market 


-  In the right column ,  they might evaluate the rsum of  product manager from Palm because some features of Palms products have been warmly embraced ,  while others have bombed 


-  Having barely enough forces the ventures managers to flounder around with actual customers ,  rather than in the corporate treasury ,  for ways to get money 


-  Tight purse strings force managers to uncover  viable strategy quickly  if one exists 


-  ,  The second misconception is that the corporation needs to be patient  that it should be prepared to accept large losses for sustained periods in order to reap the huge upside that eventually comes from disruptive innovation 


-  It takes time for new markets to emerge: Customers have to discover where ,  when and why they are using  new product ,  and the new venture has to define  profitable business model 


-  All new ventures lose money for  time at the outset ,  but corporate executives should expect the managers of  new business to find  way to make profit within  couple of years 


-  Small but profitable ventures need to be given time to establish the new market and grow to  substantial size 


- 10 ,  Processes and Values In any company ,  mainstream processes and criteria for setting priorities  ( values )  have been honed to sustain the core business 


-  Typically ,  key processes that work well in the core  ( such as strategic planning and product development )  actually impede what needs to be done in an emerging business 


-  And the criteria for setting priorities and making decisions that are inherent to the business model of the new enterprise often must be very different from those that are useful in the mainstream 


-  ,   key to nurturing  new growth business is recognizing when to leverage the parent corporations resources ,  processes and values ,  and when to create new ones 


-  In our experience ,  the CEO has to make this judgment because there are no simple rules to follow 


-  There is strong evidence that without the CEOs intervention ,  the power of habitual ways of doing things will direct new ventures into the sustaining mode  and the core business must be sustained ,  after all ,  even as the new one is nurtured 


-  In the mid-1990s ,  dArbeloff sensed that competitors were considering  scaled-down tester that would rely on inexpensive semiconductor chips and off-the-shelf software 


-  Such  product could test simple circuits at the low end of the market ,  at  quarter of the multimillion dollar cost of Teradynes machines 


-  ,  DArbeloff decided to get there first and set up  separate business unit to disrupt the market  and Teradyne itself 


-  One of the keys to the development of what became the successful Integra tester business was flexibility to create appropriate processes for annual budgets ,  sales projections and strategic planning ,  compared with the standards that would have been imposed if the project had been part of  mainstream division 


-  The venture was ,  however ,  kept to very tight cost controls 


-  Moreover ,  dArbeloff kept the values guiding the project clear: The product was to be simple and low-cost 


-  The team developing it had to find  market that would welcome an inexpensive tester with limited functionality 


-  But in our interviews with managers of companies that failed to capitalize on disruptive opportunities ,  not once did anyone say ,  We just never thought of it 


-  We have suggested how executives might shape and implement  strategy to create  single new disruptive growth business 


-  To establish an organizational capability to do it over and over again ,  senior executives should build the components that go into an innovation engine 


-  To build what will be  respectable portfolio of growth businesses in five years ,  start now  and add to the portfolio every year 


-  Companies that build while they are growing can shield their nascent high-potential businesses from Wall Street pressure ,  giving each one the time it needs to iterate toward  viable strategy and then to take off 


-  ,  Establish an Aggregate Project Plan An aggregate project plan is  system to allocate resources toward strategic objectives 


-  The plan must be established before managers have considered the merits of specific product proposals; it then can be used to help company leaders systematically distribute resources to new growth businesses 


-  To determine what percentage of available resources they should allocate to disruptive new ventures ,  executives must decide in advance the number of such businesses the company needs to start or acquire each year in order to have robustly growing businesses five and 10 years down the road ,  when growth of the core business has slowed 


-  Propositions for new growth businesses compete only for the planned number of disruptive slots in the plan in  given year ,  and sustaining ideas are matched against other sustaining possibilities 


-  As  result ,  companies need to create different processes for evaluating and shaping disruptive ideas 


-  Sales ,  marketing and engineering employees have the great ideas in most companies 


-  They should be trained in the language of sustaining and disruptive innovation and understand the litmus tests so that they know what kinds of ideas they should channel into sustaining processes  and what kinds they should direct into disruptive channels 


-  Capturing ideas for new growth businesses from people in direct contact with markets and technologies is far more productive than relying on analyst-laden business-development departments 


-  Front-line employees are also well positioned to scout for small acquisitions with disruptive potential 


-  If the price is reasonable ,  it is often better to acquire  company whose strategy passes the litmus tests than to start from scratch internally 


-  Senior management should therefore create  team at the corporate level that is responsible for collecting disruptive-innovation ideas and molding them into propositions that fit the litmus tests 


-  The members of this team have to understand the litmus tests at  deep level and use them repeatedly 


-  Such experience will help the team develop  collective intuition about how to shape disruptive business plans 


-  We use the word intuition deliberately here 


-  While the process that molds ideas into sustaining innovations can be deliberate ,  data-driven and analytical ,  the process for shaping disruptive businesses must be driven by intuitive understanding of the possibilities 


-  Between 1950 and 1980 Sony introduced 12 disruptions that created huge new growth markets and helped the company topple competitors that had been the leaders in the electronics industry 


-  Between 1980 and 1997 ,  Sony continued to be technologically innovative ,  but every innovation during this period was sustaining 


-  Sonys PlayStation and Vaio notebook computers ,  for example ,  are great products ,  but they were late entrants targeted at well-established markets 


-  How did the companys ability to develop sustaining innovations come to squeeze out its ability to continue generating disruptive ones? ,  Before 1980 ,  Sony founder Akio Morita and  small group of trusted associates made every new product-launch decision 


-  As  policy ,  they never did any market research  if  market did not exist ,  they believed ,  it could not be analyzed 


-  The company began beefing up its marketing functions with  


-  who favored the use of data-driven ,  analytical processes to assess market needs 


-  Such processes can only identify and shape sustaining innovations  and as  consequence ,  Sony lost its ability to continue launching disruptive businesses 


-  ,  Because all corporations that hope to sustain growth need streams of sustaining innovations within business units and disruptive innovations in new units ,  we advocate the creation of  Sony-like group at the corporate level that develops  similar practiced intuition about disruptive ventures 


-  The process for selecting managers needs to employ very different criteria from those used to promote managers within established businesses 


-  It should define and articulate throughout the company the technology or market scope governing disruptive business plans 


-  Twice  year or so ,  team members should hold refresher training sessions with sales ,  marketing and engineering people in each operating unit 


-  Such updates are critical because they can help innovators within the corporation refine their ability to recognize disruptive innovations when they encounter them 


-  ,  Processes are not created in PowerPoint presentations; they are defined only when  group of people does something over and over again 


-  This is why intuitive processes for creating disruptive growth businesses need to be honed in  dedicated group 


-  ,  The structure of our proposed innovation engine is quite different from  conventionally managed corporate venture-capital organization 


-  But it only appears random ,  we believe ,  because managers havent understood the factors that lead to success or cause failure 


-  Spending too much on the wrong strategy in an attempt to get big fast; putting people with inappropriate experience in charge; violating the litmus tests; and launching growth initiatives in an ad hoc manner when it is already too late  these reasons for failure can be managed and avoided 


-  Executives who understand the potential pitfalls and work to make the creation of disruptive new businesses  corporate process  an organizational capability that is constantly practiced  can start laying the groundwork for  company future blessed by continuous healthy growth
