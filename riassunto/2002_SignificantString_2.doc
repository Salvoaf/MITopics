-  And yet the motivation to pursue such innovations should be urgent 


-  ,  Most managers understand that significant ,  new ,  sustainable growth comes from creating new markets and ways of competing 


-  ( To have  truer sense of whether  disruptive strategy may work in the future ,  its at least as important to understand what hasnt worked as what has 


-  We conclude by outlining the process any company will need to institute if it wants to create an engine capable of building new disruptive businesses over and over again 


-  ,  If an idea cant be shaped to pass this litmus test ,  the chances for creating  new growth business diminish considerably 


-  ,  Test #3: Will the innovation help customers do more easily and effectively what they are already trying to do? ,  This test requires innovators to keep in mind one essential fact: At  fundamental level ,  the things that people want to accomplish in their lives dont change quickly 


-  Because of this stability ,  if an idea for  new growth business is predicated on customers wanting to do something that hadnt been  priority in the past ,  it stands little chance of success 


-  The reason is that those companies have violated the first two litmus tests 


-  Whether that happens after  brutal ,  feature-for-feature fight involving sustaining technology  or after  huge new growth market is created among  new set of customers who have found new ways and reasons for consuming images depends on whether the companies in this space shape their strategies to create disruptive growth or allow the default settings of sustaining strategy to determine their targets 


-   quite different strategy  disrupting the industry leaders business model  also harnesses the power of asymmetric motivation 


-  It creates the asymmetric motivation needed for disruptive success 


-  ,  For good reasons ,  full-service retailers ceded the low end of the market to the discounters 


-  Clearly ,  it made sense for the full-service department stores to get out of the tiers of the market that the discounters were motivated to enter 


-  ,  This is the sort of asymmetry of motivation that managers need to create if they hope to build  successful new growth business within the same market served by industry leaders 


-  Thats not disruption  its bad business! ,  The strategy of business-model disruption isnt as common as the strategy of competing against nonconsumption ,  but it can be very effective ,  as it has been repeatedly in retailing 


-  ,  Executives who are shaping  low-end disruptive business-model strategy need to be sure it is unattractive to every powerful incumbent 


-  ,  To get  sense of how managers might use the litmus tests to shape an idea into  disruptive business plan ,  lets examine whether Xerox could disrupt Hewlett-Packards ink-jet printing business 


-  We dont actually know if Xerox has considered this possibility ,  and we use the companies names only to make the example more vivid 


-   disruptive business-model strategy that attacks the low end probably cant succeed in this space 


-  Hewlett-Packard and its competitors already competed successfully against nonconsumption when they launched their easy-to-use ,  inexpensive ink-jet printers to disrupt expensive laser printers 


-  ,  Could Xerox use its technology to help customers do something more easily that they are already trying to do? Is there  low-performance product that people would happily buy? Quite possibly 


-  ,   key ,  again ,  is asymmetry of motivation 


-  To create as much asymmetry as possible ,  Xerox would also want to develop  business model that was attractive to Xerox but unattractive to H-P 


-  In that scenario ,  Xerox would retain the motivation to go after H-Ps business ,  while H-P would be less motivated to fight back 


-  The counterintuitive point is that managers whom corporate leaders have learned to trust because of their success in the mainstream business probably cannot be counted on to lead  radical new venture 


-  ,  For this hypothetical business ,  Xeroxs CEO might want to emulate the former CEO of Teradyne ,  Alexander dArbeloff 


-  In the mid-1990s ,  dArbeloff sensed that competitors were considering  scaled-down tester that would rely on inexpensive semiconductor chips and off-the-shelf software 


-  Many observers assume that an absence of good ideas is the reason for the fall of once-disruptive companies ,  and they try to focus their own companies on generating new ideas 


-  In fact ,  the executives had actively considered and usually experimented with the disruptions that eventually displaced them 


-  The plan must be established before managers have considered the merits of specific product proposals; it then can be used to help company leaders systematically distribute resources to new growth businesses 


-  They should be trained in the language of sustaining and disruptive innovation and understand the litmus tests so that they know what kinds of ideas they should channel into sustaining processes  and what kinds they should direct into disruptive channels 


-  If the price is reasonable ,  it is often better to acquire  company whose strategy passes the litmus tests than to start from scratch internally 


-  The members of this team have to understand the litmus tests at  deep level and use them repeatedly 


-  While the process that molds ideas into sustaining innovations can be deliberate ,  data-driven and analytical ,  the process for shaping disruptive businesses must be driven by intuitive understanding of the possibilities 


-  How did the companys ability to develop sustaining innovations come to squeeze out its ability to continue generating disruptive ones? ,  Before 1980 ,  Sony founder Akio Morita and  small group of trusted associates made every new product-launch decision 


-  ,  Processes are not created in PowerPoint presentations; they are defined only when  group of people does something over and over again 


-  Spending too much on the wrong strategy in an attempt to get big fast; putting people with inappropriate experience in charge; violating the litmus tests; and launching growth initiatives in an ad hoc manner when it is already too late  these reasons for failure can be managed and avoided 


-  Executives who understand the potential pitfalls and work to make the creation of disruptive new businesses  corporate process  an organizational capability that is constantly practiced  can start laying the groundwork for  company future blessed by continuous healthy growth
