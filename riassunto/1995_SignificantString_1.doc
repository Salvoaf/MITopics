-  Simultaneously designing  product and its manufacturing system  ( often referred to as concurrent or simultaneous engineering of overlapping tasks )  is generally seen as the salient characteristic of this competitive edge; Toyota ,  the most successful Japanese automotive company ,  is credited as one of the originators of concurrent engineering  ( CE )  


-  Few guessed that these methods would prove compatible with ,  and perhaps essential to ,  factory efficiency well above Japanese companies already high average 


-  While the formal concept of set-based concurrent engineering is not Toyotas  Ward and Seering developed it in automating design processes  we have found something approaching  coherent ,  company-wide ,  set-based philosophy only at Toyota 


-  In this approach ,  designers explicitly communicate and think about sets of design alternatives at both conceptual and parametric levels 


-  This approach contrasts with the common practice of iterating  making modifications or improvements in series  on one alternative until  satisfactory solution emerges 


-  ,  To understand why set-based CE can be efficient ,  consider one simple problem  selecting  meeting time 


-  For large ,  busy groups ,  convergence to  satisfactory time for all parties can require lengthy communications  the disadvantage of  point-to-point search in which no individual has all the required knowledge 


-  ,  There are two common strategies for shortening the search yet retaining the point-to-point model 


-  First ,  the group can have  meeting to decide when to have  meeting: this accelerates the communication ,  at the cost of some members time 


-  Toyota uses engineering checklists or lessons learned books  ( our term )  to represent sets of manufacturable designs in order to constrain the styling process  for example ,  requiring the stylists to avoid some extreme body curves 


-  Case examples provide data for three kinds of communication: between stylists and body engineers ,  between body engineers and manufacturing engineers ,  and between original equipment manufacturers  ( OEMs )  and suppliers 


-  Finally ,  we explain the paradox between inefficient steps and an efficient overall process and discuss implications for managers and future research 


-  In the beginning ,  we recognized the difficulties in measuring the degree to which  particular company uses set-based design  particularly since this is  relatively new concept 


-  ,  the interface between product design and manufacturing system design )  


-  We also asked about the body styling and engineering process and the interface between body engineering and manufacture 


-  We asked respondents to describe their development process from the early concept stages through production and then probed with standard questions to understand the degree to which their process is set-based 


-  Toyotas process continues to be far more concurrent than other companies: for example ,  Toyota begins designing and building body-stamping dies before all drawings are finished ,  something neither Nissan nor Mazda does 


-  ,  We cannot trace in detail the causal links between Toyotas concurrent engineering practices and Toyota quality ,  efficiency ,  and market success ,  but Toyota is doing something right 


-  Much of its success is certainly due to Toyotas production system ,  but it is widely believed that manufacturing efficiency and product reliability are strongly influenced by design and ,  therefore ,  by development processes 


-  companies consider essential ,  such as collocated ,  dedicated multifunctional teams ,   highly structured development process ,  and frequent meetings with suppliers 


-  ,  body engineering )  ,  in consultation with the chief engineer  ( shusa )  for  car platform ,  assigns engineers to  vehicle program as they are needed 


-  Chrysler considers dedicated platform teams to be essential and matrix management approaches that combine program managers with functional organizations to be ineffective 


-  As in the kanban system on the factory floor ,  subteams are responsible for deciding when to start work 


-  Suppliers and manufacturing teams ,  for example ,  have major deadline goals ,  such as the start of full production or the first vehicle prototype 


-  The suppliers  ( or manufacturers )  initiate when to obtain the information they need to meet the deadline 


-  conventional practices ,  including multifunctional teams and powerful development leaders ,  and the differences we found do not imply that recent  


-  Toyota may not need dedicated ,  collocated teams because its corporate culture allows effective communication between chimneys 


-  companies may need more structured processes because they are trying to change rapidly 


-  Toyotas suppliers may need to communicate less because of their long association  ( the explanation they gave us most often )  


-  Toyota may even simply lag  


-  automotive managers seem to think so 


-  It also explains the more surprising ,  even seemingly irrational differences we describe in the next section 


-  But Toyota is not following this paradigm ,  and its practices make perfect sense within its paradigm 


-  ,  An engineering design text widely used in the United States for the past several decades ,  Shigleys Mechanical Engineering Design prescribes  process that iterates through  sequence of steps in which  designer first understands  problem and then synthesizes  solution  ( see Figure  )  


- 16 The designer then analyzes and evaluates the solution; based on the analysis ,  he or she tries  new solution  ( and maybe modifies the problem definition )  


-  Figure  illustrates this point-to-point search 


-  ,  Partly because  majority of automotive engineers were trained to use the Shigley method ,  this view of engineering design is pervasive in engineering thinking 


-  line engineers respond immediately ,  Thats the way we do it ,  often mentioning improvements that leave the basic model intact ,  sometimes vaguely implying that there must be  better way 


-  ,  Why does Toyota go through so many iterations ,  generating different designs? Why does Toyota take so long to synthesize the first solution ,  providing the starting point for modifications? ,  Toyotas development process looks expensive ,  clumsy ,  and inefficient to outsiders  ( including other Japanese companies )  if they view it as  badly run version of their own point-to-point search 


-  Toyota does not conduct  point-to-point search but follows  version of set-based concurrent engineering  ( see Figure  )  ,  There are several aspects of set-based concurrent engineering evident in the approaches of Toyota and its suppliers: First ,  design authors have long advocated examining  number of concepts ,  and Pugh developed sophisticated methods for gradually narrowing the development funnel 


-  ,  Second ,  design for robustness ,  including Taguchis techniques ,  considers  set of possible environmental conditions 


- 19 ,  Fourth ,  Toyota extensively uses what we call lessons learned books ,  not simply to record lessons but to define the space of manufacturable designs to product engineers 


-  We argue that the philosophy explains Toyotas unusual practices 


-  By communicating  whole set of possibilities simultaneously and avoiding changes that move outside the set ,  Toyota can reduce the frequency of communication ,  eliminate the need for dedication and collocation ,  and reduce supplier communications for  simpler process structure 


-  The philosophy may represent  new model that explains Toyotas success 


-  The timing of an actual Toyota program will vary somewhat depending on how much of the vehicle is new and changing and even on the particular chief engineer running the program 


-  Team members begin preparation for milestones whenever they need to 


-  At this point ,   substantial portion of the design has been decided  ( though many important issues remain open )  ,  and engineers begin detailed drawings based on the K4  ( the K4 itself is not updated )  


-  But we do not mean to imply that Toyota is widely exploring all possible design options for all parts of the vehicle simultaneously 


-  Toyota has  reputation as  conservative company for good reason 


-  Getting  high-quality vehicle on the market very quickly is  top priority ,  and Toyota realizes that excessive experimentation will make this impossible 


- 21 Engineers who want to make major changes must provide hard evidence through data that the new design is  major improvement over the existing design 


-  Many of the design decisions we have described as set-based are ,  in fact ,  incremental fine-tuning for the sake of fit and finish ,  marginal performance improvements ,  or weight/cost reductions 


-  Interviewees had different opinions on the role of the two models: some stated that the final design was usually close to one of the models ,  implying that they represent two discrete options 


-  The book ,  ten to twelve pages long ,  contained approximately sixty to seventy different ranges of specifications that would ensure the fender designs manufacturability  (  


-  Often the suggestions resolve the problem to all parties satisfaction 


-  ,  This strategy defines the set of manufacturable designs 


-  From  theoretical standpoint ,  for any given design problem ,  there is  true ,  yet unknown ,  design space that includes all possible values for all the parameters 


-  First ,  stylists ,  body engineers ,  and production engineers each maintain their own version of the lessons-learned books as guidelines for manufacturability in design and audit 


-  Second ,  if the two clay models establish bounds on what is acceptable to the stylists ,  other functional groups can quickly identify the intersection between this set and the set acceptable to them; there is no need for  prolonged series of suggested changes ,  which must in turn be examined by the other functional groups 


-  ,  The general manager of body engineering remarked that delaying the decision on critical dimensions until the last possible moment is necessary to ensure that customers expectations are fully understood ,  that they will be satisfied by the body design ,  and that the design is also manufacturable 


-  companies told us that the key to achieving manufacturable designs quickly was to freeze the hardpoints early  ( in at least one case ,  before development of the full-size model )  ,  thereby giving manufacturing more time to respond ,  but risking  suboptimal solution 


-  Toyota engineers have just over two years to go from concept approval to full volume production ,  which hinges on early development of the manufacturing process ,  that is ,  die design and production 


-  In some cases ,  castings are ordered and die production begins while design tolerances  ( implied or actual ranges for the final design parameters as distinct from manufacturing tolerances that are set much later )  are still maintained on the critical dimensions 


-  Thus process engineers can do all the work they want ,  as long as they maintain enough flexibility to accommodate all possibilities within the tolerances 


-  ,  Finally ,  Toyota body engineers routinely omit most manufacturing tolerances on body-part dimensions 


-  The body designers thus define the acceptable set of cars ,  allowing the manufacturing engineers to make the parts fit ,  within the wide tolerance bands 


-  The manufacturing engineers typically build dies on the nominal dimensions and make  series of parts ,  which they assemble into  screw body or functional build to check for fit 


-  ,  The lessons-learned books are another way of representing feasible design alternatives from  manufacturing perspective 


-  There are few conflicts between design and manufacturing engineers ,  because they need find only some intersection of the preferred regions for both 


-  Process engineers can start early on die planning because such ranges on the hardpoints place bounds on anticipated changes downstream in the design process; they design for the set of possible solutions 


-  Rather than treat each sheet-metal part as the final design that the die should precisely reflect ,  this approach assumes that the blueprints are guidelines 


-  automotive manufacturer provides  starkly contrasting example of more traditional ,  point-based body development 


-  The manufacturers design and development process consists of concept development ,  prototype ,  production tooling ,  and production phases 


- 25 ,  In the early concept development phase ,   small group of project designers work on  number of different sketches representing body design alternatives ,  evaluate the alternatives ,  and choose the best one 


-  Manufacturing is brought into the development loop only after the base design is defined ,  although manufacturing was recently collocated with the product design team to bring its considerations into the design 


-  ,  Next ,  manufacturing and other functional areas evaluate the design and propose changes to  plastic model 


-  The manufacturing engineers critique is based on their experience and intuition 


-  Hard-points are fixed as early as possible and changed only if manufacturing discovers that the design is impossible to make ,  or crash testing determines that it does not meet government standards 


-   single design solution is selected early in the development cycle and then modified from different functional perspectives  ( such as body manufacturing )  to achieve an acceptable result 


-  There is little opportunity to address the unique combination of customer demands and manufacturing problems posed by the design 


-  If the stylists or body engineers define  difficult design ,  it must be changed according to manufacturings critique ,  which may drive further changes 


-  ,  Several Toyota managers explained that they vary suppliers design responsibility ,  depending on capability 


-  We developed  three-level hierarchy from our observations ,  based on the influence of the suppliers in decision making ,  particularly on the component specifications 


-  Such suppliers do extensive development well before Toyota decides on its own vehicle concepts ,  often presenting Toyota with  wide range of alternatives early in the process 


-  ,  The second-level ,  mature suppliers wait for Toyota to define its needs for  specific vehicle concept before beginning development 


-  The supplier may design to specification or simply manufacture  Toyota design 


-  These full or partial prototypes are used to evaluate the engineers design ideas 


-  Nippondenso experiments extensively but also relies heavily on charts ,  graphs ,  test data ,  past experience ,  and professional judgment to decide which designs to continue 


-  ,  Nippondensos radiator group members described  similar process of creating prototypes early to evaluate designs ,  then gradually narrowing the possibilities over time ,  creating and testing prototypes at each step 


-  It gathers information on all prospective Toyota car models  ( and to  lesser degree at other customers )  and the anticipated requirements 


-  ,  Nippondensos advanced R&D efforts result in  catalog of components that covers most of its customers needs 


-  The customer picks from the catalog ,  and Nippondenso designs interface components if necessary and manufactures the full range of needed parts on  single production line 


-  For several reasons ,  Toyota usually chooses from the set of possible solutions rather than asking for  custom design: First ,  Nippondenso anticipates its customers future needs 


-  Standardization cuts costs ,  while variety meets the customers needs 


-  The advanced R&D process ,  about two to three years ,  is driven by Toyotas long-range goals and improvements ,  the suppliers own long-range goals ,  and feedback from Toyota on existing parts ,  The companies begin by generating many ideas for improvement ,  then choose four to five full prototypes ,  and test and evaluate along all critical dimensions 


-  ,  This strategy  using sets of prototypes that are narrowed over time for  new design  clearly has set-based underpinnings: these companies not only consider but build and test  wide variety of designs 


-  The engineers interviewed did not describe  set-narrowing process but  process of starting with one design ,  moving to the next ,  then the next ,  in  point-to-point serial fashion 


-  Suppliers commented that the Toyota engineers ,  all knowledgeable about their particular product ,  often discuss how the designs can be improved 


-  ,  In every case ,  the presentations precede any specific information or statements from Toyota about the new model ,  but the suppliers are able to proceed because of their long relationship with Toyota and knowledge of current trends 


-  manufacturer develops  list of specifications in-house  ( perhaps in consultation with suppliers )  ,  then sends the specifications to prospective suppliers and asks for proposals 


-  At Toyota ,  final specifications are decided approximately two years after supplier presentations 


-  It also understands the possibilities sets whose endpoints are the current product at one end and the latest developments at the other 


-  manufacturer ,  on the other hand ,  does not expend the same energy to understand its constraints 


-  Thus it appears the Toyota process compensates for the costs of its system by facilitating  well-informed decision-making process 


- 29 ,  Supplier presentations play  critical role in Toyotas ability to set reasonable targets for its suppliers 


-  An example is an exhaust system in which noise reduction characteristics vary for different models;  luxury sedan may need  very quiet ride ,  while  sports coupe may require more noise and throaty timbre 


-  Approximate maximum/minimum targets are generally expressed in terms of improvements over an existing product or the prototype in the presentation: Toyota is likely to want gurai  percent reduction in cost ,  or gurai  percent improvement in power output 


-  If the meeting is tense ,  gurai means Toyota really needs the target to be met ,   


-  )  During the months that follow ,  the suppliers diligently strive to meet the targets through design improvements 


-  Toyota gives basic requirements that are expressly vague  an anticipated change of 20 percent to 30 percent and asks suppliers to explore the areas around the requirements by building and testing prototypes or by computer simulation 


-  The general manager commented that this process allows the shusa to understand trade-offs and set targets to produce the best possible design 


-  ,  Another Toyota general manager of engineering explained that they typically set targets on each component higher than really necessary by as much as 20 percent 


-  They realize that ,  with production variations ,  this ensures  comfort zone so parts out of tolerance will actually be quality parts 


-  They also want the supplier to stretch; if the target is too easy ,  the supplier will relax and not try to continuously push possible boundaries 


- 30 In short ,  the automaker decides what price the market will bear for the total vehicle and works back ,  roughly allocating costs to major subsystems and components 


- 31 In the Japanese system ,  there is much greater opportunity to explicitly consider trade-offs between cost ,  performance ,  and weight in the early design stage ,  before commitments are made 


-  ,  We have argued that the set-based paradigm explains the contrast of Toyotas apparently inefficient steps with  highly efficient overall process 


-  Here are some potential advantages we see in the set-based approach to design: ,  In the conventional ,  point-to-point search ,  every change that part of an organization makes may invalidate all previous decisions 


-  Since designs are highly interconnected in obscure ways ,  it is generally impossible to tell whether  particular change alters decisions already made 


-  Toyotas body designers waste little time on detailed designs that cannot be manufactured because the manufacturing personnel can precisely define the set of bodies that are manufacturable ,  using the lessons-learned books ,  and structural decisions have been made concurrently through the K4 process before detailed design begins 


-  Toyotas suppliers know the amount of design tolerance in their specifications at any point in the process and therefore know to what extent they can commit themselves 


-  This may be  major reason why Toyota can allow parts of  team to get started when they want ,  rather than forcing them to follow  rigid schedule 


-  ,  Finally ,  set-based communication can increase trust in working relationships 


-  But if the supplier has  lot of information and is informed in advance about the set of possible changes ,  trust will build in the partnership 


-  ,  In the conventional model ,  planning the manufacturing process before the product is defined makes little sense 


-  But in the set-based paradigm ,  the manufacturing processes that might apply to the set of possible products can be planned ,  early on 


-  Thus innovation in the manufacturing process may drive innovation in the product design ,  as described in Whitneys discussion of the Nippondenso jikigata designs 


- 33 The manufacturing team can focus on  new part of the product design space and assume that the product will be designed as much to fit the new manufacturing system as the manufacturing system to fit the new product 


-  This is equivalent to telling them to try harder and be more careful ,  not particularly useful advice 


-  ,  Designers are notoriously resistant to documenting their work ,  partly because they sense documentation is generally useless 


-  For example ,  the lessons-learned books at Toyota are updated to reflect Toyota engineers experiences with the manufacturability of various body designs 


-  From the start ,  body designers know which angles can be manufactured and which are difficult to make ,  without even talking to manufacturing engineers 


-  An important task for further research is therefore to demonstrate this causal link more carefully 


-  Toyota has  long-standing relationship with highly competent suppliers that put in extra effort for the set-based approach ,  function on long-term relationships rather than contracts ,  and understand Toyotas informal communications about design sets 


-  Toyota engineers serve  minimum of fifteen years before reaching management positions ,  have extensive hands-on experience ,  undergo frequent training ,  and are vigorously encouraged to think about their jobs and technologies by managers who are themselves technical experts 


-  Set-based concurrent engineering seems likely to require more skill and judgment than the simpler ,  point-to-point approach; its adoption by companies with lower average skill levels might be difficult 


-  ,  We cannot therefore recommend crash programs to develop set-based concurrent engineering 


-  Rather ,  companies that want to gain this new competitive edge should experiment in developing concrete techniques ,  while carefully pondering the philosophical implications and management of suppliers and personnel
