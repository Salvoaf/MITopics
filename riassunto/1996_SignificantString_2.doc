-  On the other hand ,  managers who were tired of IS budget growth year after year and sometimes elusive business benefits saw an opportunity to cut IT costs ,  downsize the IS function ,  and do to IT what they were doing in other parts of the business  subcontract 


-  ,  The objectives of outsourcing are cost cutting;  desire to focus on the business ,  not on IT  ( or on core systems ,  not on the total application portfolio )  or subcontracting responsibilities for operating and maintaining legacy systems 


-  Whatever the objective ,  the possibility of outsourcing tends to generate strong emotions among both IS professionals and general managers 


-  These prescriptions help both the companies that are bold protagonists of IT outsourcing and those that think they have to do some outsourcing and would appreciate guidelines on being selective 


-  ,  There is currently  trend toward selective or smart sourcing and  recognition of alternative sourcing strategies ,  whatever the objective 


-  If business value is high but operational performance is weak ,  then market testing  ( or benchmarking )  might make sense ,  at least so  company can see what performance improvement might be possible by either internal or external sourcing 


-  While  am not retracting my conclusions ,  on the basis of experience  ( namely ,  discussions with both vendors and customers in Europe and North America )  ,   now suggest that managers ask why does outsourcing make sense and why does it work 


-  Those who have outsourced have more regrets than they acknowledge and more anxieties about vendors than they care to confront 


-  Furthermore ,  frameworks for analysis like that in Figure  ,  while highlighting different sourcing options ,  also give momentum to outsourcing because they imply that the marketplace has significant potential in the supply of IT services ,  albeit in different ways ,  whatever the difficulties involved 


-  ,  So  offer ,  unapologetically ,   plea that CIOs and CEOs proceed with caution when they consider IT outsourcing 


-  Yet let us consider the likely causes or context of poor performance 


-  ,  If cost or quality problems are due to inadequate economies of scale ,  outsourcing can make sense ,  although there may be internal solutions available through centralized rationalization 


-  These are sensible precautions and probably should precede any out-sourcing based on dissatisfaction with operations 


-  If there are changes in the vendors personnel or organization ,  the company has to invest in building new partnerships and understanding how things are done in the new regime 


-  Vendors may pull out at the first stage when they learn how weak the customers IT management is; they recognize that weak management is not an opportunity for profit taking but  recipe for conflict and dissatisfaction 


-  Even the boldest company would try to transfer some of its IT staff to the vendor to ensure some continuity of service and knowledge in the short run 


-  However ,  the above examples suggest that there may be long-term opportunity costs ,  which can increase with business uncertainty 


-  ,  If cost reduction is the objective in an outsourcing deal ,  the hope is that the current cost base is reduced and that ,  over time ,  there are further cost reductions due to learning and technological change 


-  ,  If better focus is the objective ,  the customer may be willing to pay for future inefficiency 


-  However ,  as several vendors have pointed out ,  customers often require cost reductions along with any other objective they first had in mind 


-  The same can be true of companies whose original objective was to get rid of the legacy systems 


-   lawyer in this field remarked that he was happy to take legal fees from clients who believed that IT was  game of certainty and discovered that it was not ,  but he would prefer to earn money by educating them 


-  However ,  the more likely it is that uncertainties will materialize ,  the more  company might wish to control its own destiny 


-  ,  When cost reduction is the objective of outsourcing ,  there is typically  promise of early cash flow benefits and long-term cost savings 


-  company that considers its outsourcing  success reports ,  We never anticipated the management resources and time  and thus cost  that we have had to put in 


-  Organizations tend to learn to manage IT by doing; they do not appreciate the challenges until they have experienced them 


-  Likewise ,  an airline reported that more of the information linkages it needed to build as it competes on knowledge were in segments of its infrastructure that it had previously classified as commodity ,  over which it had relaxed its control 


-  ,  Of course ,  there is no reason that  third party cannot operate ,  enhance ,  or rebuild an application that has been reclassified as strategic 


-  We will have to think about how to rise to the challenge 


-  ,  While this situation does not prove that innovation cannot be bought ,  it suggests that partners have their limitations and that expectations must be properly managed 


-  )  The complex web of likely relationships within the marketplace also limits the opportunities for users who understand the business to interact with specialists who understand the technology on  continuing informal and formal basis 


-  ,  Some years ago when IT specialists and users could not understand each other ,   few companies created  new role for intermediaries or interpreters between the two parties 


-  Often called business analysts ,  client managers ,  or systems liaison officers ,  they sought in theory to understand user needs and convey them to the specialists ,  while representing the specialists concerns to the users 


-  ,  Curiously ,  company managers often claim they want to work with people who belong to and understand their culture 


-  Meanwhile ,  the remaining IT personnel are likely to rethink how they can add value and probably will hone up their skills in project management ,  teamwork ,  negotiation ,  and conflict resolution 


-  ,  The desktop in  typical knowledge-based organization has  PC hardware platform  ( which may have PCs and Macintoshes )  


-  In front are personal knowledge-working tools and applications ,  perhaps interfacing with enterprise-level groupware 


-  ,  Previously ,  in data centers ,  arguments with vendors about responsibility when something went wrong were commonplace 


-  More important ,  think about solving  user-support query 


-  Where in the various components of desktop architecture does the problem lie? In the interface between the users highly knowledge-specific local application and the technology architecture ,  or in incompatible software releases? Is it  local area network fault or  server problem? More particularly ,  does the new support person from the outsourcing supplier understand the problem well enough to sort it out quickly? It can be difficult to delineate the desktop and create sufficiently generic support skills and specific user-oriented capabilities ,  because there are too many interdependencies 


-  Does his rating comment on the companys IS function ,  on the inherent complexity and indivisibility of the desktop ,  or on the very visible nature of distributed and end-user computing environments? If  third party who was brought in to take over desktop service could not cope ,  the levels of satisfaction would only decline further 


-  Given the inevitable company-specific nature of the desktop domain ,  it is advisable to think twice about outsourcing in this and other such indivisible areas of IT 


-  One knowledge-based organization learned this lesson from the marketplace 


-  As corporate knowledge about IT outsourcing continues to advance ,  the strategy of selective or smart sourcing may become the norm 


-  The common reasons for outsourcing IT services  cost reduction ,  business focus ,  and subcontracting legacy systems  remain sensible goals
