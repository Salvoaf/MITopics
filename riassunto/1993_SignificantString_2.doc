-  In fact ,  some legislators and  growing number of consumer advocates are proposing sweeping restrictions without sound knowledge of the legitimate motivations for DBM efforts ,  their promise for useful exchange ,  and the important societal choices inherent in the expansion or restriction of these efforts 


-  ,  What questions should all of us be asking about the opportunities and pitfalls of DBM developments? How can managers handle the apparent tension among marketing efficiencies ,  intrusion ,  and exclusion posed by DBM technology and techniques? These questions cannot be addressed usefully by simply appealing to the individuals right to be left alone  ( as privacy advocates typically do )  or to  companys inalienable information property rights  ( as managers often do )  


-  Few people really want to be left alone ,  as indicated by increases of sales through telemarketing ,  direct mail ,  direct response ,  and related channels 


-  Rather than being left alone ,  most people want protection against unwarranted uses of personal information with minimal damage to their increased choice and flexibility as consumers 


-  Most companies want access to pertinent consumer data so their products and marketing programs can respond to dynamic changes in demand 


-  ,  We believe there is  middle ground between the extremes of the debate that can provide better guidance to company policies and public policy 


-  In this article ,  we examine the motivations behind DBM efforts and the key social issues that are redefining the meaning of good marketing practice 


-  ,  While technology provides the means ,  changes in communication and distribution channels provide the motivation for firms to use DBM programs 


-  Hence ,  many companies have good reasons for targeting potential buyers more precisely 


-  To date ,  most concern has centered around privacy issues ,  but there is reason to believe that other issues will  ( and should )  become just as prominent 


- 11 ,  But rarely considered is that ,  in the DBM context ,  privacy has two discrete components: physical privacy and information privacy 


-  ,  Many state laws and regulations protect physical privacy from unwanted telephone calls ,  mail ,  and faxes  ( see Table  )  


-  The situation regarding information privacy is more complex ,  but we believe that it is ultimately the more important area ,  from the perspective of both marketers and public policy makers ,  and we concentrate on information privacy in this paper 


-   banking executive argued that consumers provide information about themselves so that we can better serve the customers needs ,  and she interpreted this to mean the use of the information for subsequent DBM efforts 


-  Similarly ,  consumers expressed much concern about use of credit card purchase data; many believed that the sole legitimate use of such data was to process the charges 


-  Miller  ( 1976 )  case regarding banking records  that  bank customer has no legally recognizable expectation of privacy in records maintained by  bank15  also applies to all other consumer transactions with respect to their use in DBM 


-  In addition ,  recent developments call this assumption into question 


-  But many of AT&Ts commercial customers who offer toll-free numbers and  major association of database marketers  have objected; they consider information about who calls them to be their data 


-  Some people use cash for most transactions in part because they do not want purchase or credit information about them to be disseminated; other people have been willing to pay $199 each to National Consumer Research ,   Kentucky-based firm ,  to have their names and purchasing habits stored in  database that is made available to database marketers 


- 19 ,  The fact is that information privacy is an ambiguous term ,  and consumers have different privacy thresholds depending on the information collected ,  how it is collected ,  and who collects it 


-  Ironically ,  the impact of much pending legislation particularly at the state level  could be more junk mail ,  as companies working under restrictions that bar access to pertinent consumer information are forced to blanket all groups ,  not just purchase-prone groups ,  with solicitations 


-  ,  Privacy issues currently fuel attention to database marketing ,  but we believe that exclusion issues will soon become prominent 


-  Two kinds of exclusion need to be considered 


-  More generally ,  questions about so-called characteristic-based discrimination ,  especially where ethnic differences are part of market segmentation schemes ,  are being raised by  variety of sources that influence the regulatory and legislative agenda 


- 21 ,  Exclusionary dangers are particularly salient in marketing channels intimately tied to information technology 


-  Because the law allows live telephone pitches  which can be better afforded and managed by large corporations  but outlaws recorded ones ,  the plaintiff has successfully argued that the law discriminates against owners of smaller businesses 


- 23 ,  Hence ,  just as marketers must realize that their DBM programs are not socially neutral ,  legislators and advocates should recognize that information safeguards and barriers are not competitively neutral 


-  Initially ,  working with  traditional understanding of good marketing practice ,  they focus on the operational mechanics of database marketing and ignore the social issues 


-  When  particular situation has come to their attention ,  usually through hyperbolic media coverage that makes no distinctions between physical privacy and information privacy ,  lawmakers introduce new laws and regulations 


-  Companies considering DBM programs thus face increasing uncertainty 


- 24 ,  To avoid these scenarios ,  managers must realize that privacy and exclusion issues inevitably direct attention to the firms marketing process itself and ,  in particular ,  to the firms criteria regarding usage of customer information 


-  They must consider ,  in developing and implementing these programs ,   new set of rules for DBM policy and practice 


-  ,  Trust has always been an important element of good marketing  trust in the products quality and consistency ,  in the salesperson ,  in the suppliers ability to remain innovative in product development and delivery 


-  With the increasing diffusion of consumer databases and technology that can access them across organizations ,  additional dimensions of trust become prominent: trust in  companys ability to keep personal information in the hands of those who have the consumers consent and to use that information in  fair manner 


-  Moreover ,  the breadth of trust required by DBM developments implicates others besides the specific buyers and sellers ,  for not only do current customers need to trust the information assemblers but so do prospective customers or any other individuals whose personal information resides on the relevant database 


-  ,  To help companies build trust with consumers and improve information exchange without counterproductive intrusion ,  we have developed  series of rules for DBM fairness ,  which are summarized in Table  


-  But when companies clearly explain both primary and secondary uses for data to individuals before they give their consent for collection ,  later charges of improper use become spurious 


-  One study found that sales pitches disguised as market research involved about 22 percent of such surveys in 1988 and were the second most-cited reason  ( after inconvenience )  given by consumers for refusing to take part in data-gathering efforts 


-  By providing this information ,  companies not only avert charges of deception and secrecy but also force marketing managers to consider their research goals and methods more rigorously 


-  Green also asks customers to indicate on  simple checklist whether they wish to be removed from the mailing list ,  have their name made available to other companies ,  or have their name used for other marketing purposes 


-  Credit card issuers could note emphatically on each application that in addition to using this information for billing purposes ,  we may also use information regarding your purchases in our marketing programs 


-  Through these programs ,  we provide you with convenient information about products and services that may be of particular interest 


-  ,  Some companies are considering implementing this policy with economic incentives 


-  In  sense ,  such practices mean that some consumers would pay more than others for enjoying privacy  ( as they define it )  


-  But we see nothing wrong with such  system ,  which recognizes the fact of consumer heterogeneity regarding these privacy issues while providing an opportunity for both companies and consumers to vote with their feet regarding the relative value of the information being solicited 


-  Most marketers now simply assume that consumers do or dont approve of various data-gathering practices and are surprised by the reaction when practices become public 


-  Many legislators have similarly broad assumptions about consumers desires to be left alone 


-  Only when information uses are explained and opt-out provisions offered can marketers and public policy makers know what diverse groups of consumers really want in different situations 


-  Credit grantors such as retailers ,  credit card issuers ,  and banks report payment histories to credit bureaus that ,  in turn ,  keep files on anyone who ever buys on credit  about 90 percent of adult Americans 


-  This situation underscores the importance of explaining to consumers the intended uses of the collected data and providing them with the option to opt out of secondary uses they find unacceptable  especially when those secondary uses include sharing with other organizations 


-  Postal officials believe that use of their electronic address list can help to reduce the  percent of third-class mail  ( about four billion pieces )  that is thrown out annually because incorrect addresses make it undeliverable 


-  Better targeting by medical suppliers might well help to increase consumer knowledge ,  widen choice ,  stimulate comparison shopping ,  and ultimately lower costs and improve service in our health care system 


- 29 But ,  despite the Direct Marketing Associations provision for such  right in its own privacy guidelines ,  our corporate interviewees said they would be hard-pressed to provide such an option for consumers in their own databases ,  primarily because their databases were not designed with such  capability in mind 


-  Hence ,  this rule looms as  major challenge to the DBM industry; it suggests  rethinking of ,  and reinvestment in ,  the data processing infrastructure 


-  No matter how they feel about specific DBM programs ,  most observers agree that the basic premise is valid: people who differ in terms of demographics ,  attitudes ,  or life circumstances are likely to purchase in different ways 


-  But many of these categorizations are essentially the private sectors version of the infamous Willie Horton political campaign ads: abstracted stereotypes rather than legitimate attempts to make sense of the multidimensional nature of how people buy 


-  The following comment was typical: It intrudes on my privacy when marketing people look at some facts about me and then say  fit  certain psychological profile 


-  The key assumption is that such techniques simply make respondents retrieve their previously formed opinions and preferences 


-  ,  Effective DBM campaigns require both types of information: data about actual purchase behavior and attitudinal data that can help to explain that behavior 


-  Managers must avoid their tendency to think they are exempt from this scrutiny because customers havent complained  ( customers may not be aware of the firms DBM activities )  or were only doing what everybody else in the industry does  ( the industrys practices may not be able to withstand future scrutiny )  


-  Whether or not they realize it ,  many companies now face real risks in continuing their current approaches to database marketing 


-  Although we hope that legislators will pull the lever thoughtfully and sparingly ,  we also agree that additional regulation is inevitable if DBM practitioners refuse to voluntarily police themselves 


-  ,  These guidelines can also remind managers that ,  in the end ,  the database is not the marketplace 


-  Companies are fooling themselves if they believe they can get close to customers through cross-tabulated compilations of names ,  addresses ,  and past purchases in  handful of product categories 


-  It requires the willingness of managers to refine and adapt their assumptions about changing consumer needs and preferences and the ability to translate this information into innovations in product ,  packaging ,  or service enhancements 


-  ,  Because so little empirical research has been done concerning companies information privacy practices in DBM activities ,  our major objectives in this study were exploratory: to understand companies practices and policies in this area as well as the views and responses of consumers and other external groups
