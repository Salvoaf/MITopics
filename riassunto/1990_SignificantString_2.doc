-  ,  We begin with this story to make two critical points 


-  The first is that customers are the sole judge of service quality 


-  Customers assess service by comparing the service they receive  ( perceptions )  with the service they desire  ( expectations )  


-   company can achieve  strong reputation for quality service only when it consistently meets customer service expectations 


-  Managers nod their heads in agreement when convention speakers stress the importance of customer focus and then go back to work and buy the equivalent of color TVs for the bathroom instead of ironing boards 


-  We have done extensive research with customers ,  front-line service providers ,  and managers in our studies of six service sectors: appliance repair ,  credit cards ,  insurance ,  long-distance telephone ,  retail banking ,  and securities brokerage 


-  ,  Through our studies ,  we have been able to identify the principal dimensions customers use to judge  companys service: ,  Knowing what customers expect is ,  of course ,  only part of the challenge 


-  In this article we attempt to answer  fundamental question: What must every company interested in improving service do to actually improve it? We answer in terms of five service imperatives: define the service role ,  compete for talent  ( and use it )  ,  emphasize service teams ,  go for reliability ,  and be great at problem resolution 


-  They include the following: ,  Service standards are customer expectations stated in  way that is meaningful to employees 


-  If well conceived ,  the standards guide and energize employees; they clarify the service task ,  convey  sense of priority ,  and provide benchmarks against which employees can judge their own performance and managers can judge the employees and the organizations performance 


-  Service standards bring  customer focus into the employees day-to-day reality of service delivery 


-  ,   common assumption is that contact personnel understand their customers service priorities by virtue of regular customer contact 


-  Our data reveals that managers in five major service companies had  more accurate grasp of customer expectations than did front-line contact employees 


-  ,  What it boils down to is this: If employees are unsure of how to deliver excellent service ,  if they think they know how but are wrong ,  or if they believe management does not really care about service ,  they are unlikely to deliver excellent service 


-  ,  Defining the service role effectively starts with formal research to identify customers principal service expectations 


-  Guessing at what customers value most in service introduces  Russian roulette dynamic into the entire chain of service-improving actions ,  from setting service standards to the staffing ,  training ,  measuring ,  appraising ,  and rewarding decisions required to support the standards 


-  ,  Although the five service dimensions presented earlier provide  framework of customer expectations ,  each company must still do its own research to measure the relative importance of the service dimensions among customers ,  prospects ,  and different market segments 


-  The firm must also assess company and competitor performance against customer expectations 


-  ,  Research also helps managers make choices among service standards and pare down the list of standards to the pivotal ones that will make  difference for customers 


-  Customers judge  companys service on the basis of  very few important service factors ,  and managers should establish  limited set of service standards for individual employees that contributes to the limited set of service goals for the organization 


-  ,  The most successful service companies focus employee attention on the preeminent service factors 


-  Indeed ,  Sewell Village is one of the few automobile dealerships where the service managers income is as handsome as the sales managers! ,  Still another key to defining the service role is to use every opportunity to communicate and reinforce service standardsin meetings and training sessions; in internal media such as wallet cards ,  desk signs ,  and wall posters; and in performance measurement ,  appraisal ,  and reward systems 


-  The explicit standards  ( for example ,  greeting or acknowledging every customer within 30 seconds )  form  basis for training ,  performance measurement ,  appraisal ,  and compensation 


-  The behavior-guiding and motivational benefits of service standards are well worth the investment necessary to develop and reinforce them 


-  Service employees need to know what excellent service meansand why they should care about delivering it 


-  ,  Defining the service role is an important step ,  but it wont get  company very far unless the company has personnel with the attitude ,  ability ,  and flexibility to fulfill the role 


-  From the customers perspective ,  the people performing the service are the company 


-  ,  So why do managers allow the wrong people to carry the company flag in front of customers? One reason is that most managers do not think like marketers when it comes to human resource issues 


-  They view marketing as something you do to win over customers but not something you do to win over employees 


-  Is this any way to compete for talent? The same companies that advertise imaginatively to compete for customers advertise with no imagination at all to recruit employees 


-  They do not base hiring standards on service standards ,  which contributes to  mismatch between the type of people the company actually hires and the type of people the company needs to hire to deliver excellent service 


-  ,  Compounding the mismatch problem is anachronistic thinking about affordable wage rates ,  with the goal of saving money dominating the goal of serving customers 


-  The tendency we observe among service firm managers to spend more liberally on things than people runs counter to our research findings that customers value the human dimensions of service more than the tangibles of service 


-  Notice the expensive floor space ,  displays ,  and inventory ,  and then try to find salespeople who are knowledgeable about the merchandise and who tune into your needs with commitment and grace 


-  Service sector employment is expanding rapidly ,  and the skills needed are being elevated just at the time that changing demographics are shrinking the labor pool of young people ,  who in many instances are not receiving the education they need to be marketable 


-  Rather than leave positions unfilled or pay what they consider to be exorbitant wages ,  many managers are hiring people who are woefully ill equipped to deliver excellent service 


-  By using thick policy and procedures manuals to control service delivery ,  managers stifle creativity ,  diminish the opportunity for employees to grow in their work ,  and chase the most able employees out the door in search of more interesting work 


-  ,  Thick rule books serve customers no better than employees 


-  They produce regimented ,  by-the-book service when  flexible ,  by-the-customer one is needed 


-  While managers are demanding that employees be robot servers ,  customers are demanding that they be thinking servers 


-  ,  One reason rule book management is so prevalent is that many managers believe it is essential to standardize service among different employees and service units 


-  However ,  another factor is that many managers simply do not trust employees judgment and make rules to replace it with their own 


-  The labor shortfall issue is also  factor 


-  If you cant get good people ,  the theory goes ,  you at least need to make sure you control their work tightly 


-  This theory is nonsense 


-  People who are qualified will perform better and stay with the company longer if given room to maneuver ,  achieve ,  and grow 


-  Managers need to compete as hard and creatively for talent market share as they compete for sales market share 


-  ,  Here is what we recommend: Market careers rather than jobs ,  market them in multiple ways ,  link hiring standards to service standards ,  and leverage the freedom factor 


-  Companies that do these things will do just fine in the talent market 


-  ,  The idea of career may seem at odds with the demographically fragmented labor pool available and the high cost of employee benefit programs  ( which make part-time workers desirable )  ,  but in fact it is smart to look for the countertrend when prevailing routines are not working 


-  Selling just  job does not typically inspire commitment and loyalty from employees or  willingness to invest in employee development from companies 


-  ,  Using good old-fashioned marketing fundamentals also makes sense 


-  This requires having written service standards for the various positions ,  written ideal candidate profiles tiiat reflect the service standards ,  and extensive line involvement in actual hiring decisions 


-  Jim Daniel ,  president of the high-performing Friendly Bank in Oklahoma City ,  makes the point well:2 ,  Of course ,  it does little good to recruit capable ,  service-minded people only to frustrate them into leaving 


-  And having good careers to market is  principal reason why service freedom is so important 


-  ,  To leverage the freedom factor ,  managers have to select their people well ,  provide them with  strong foundational culture in which to work ,  offer them strategic direction ,  and give them the company-specific training and education they need to perform their roles 


-  And then managers need to get out of their way! ,  We agree with Robert Waterman ,  who writes in The Renewal Factor: When managers guide instead of control ,  the skys the limit on what people can accomplish 


-  The sheer number of customers to be served can be psychologically and physically overwhelming 


-  Control over service can be dispersed among multiple organizational units that function without cohesion or  unified spirit ,  limiting contact employees ability to come through for their customers 


-  In numerous cases ,  however ,  what customers perceive as inhospitable behavior is actually the coping behavior of weary servers who have taken too many punches 


-  Any number of factors can account for the fact that service work pummels and changes some employees more than others 


-  ,  One dynamic that is particularly important in kindling and sustaining service-mindedness is the presence of service teammates 


-  An interactive community of coworkers who collaborate ,  overcome ,  and achieve together is  powerful antidote to service burnout 


-  To let down the boss is bad ,  but to let down the team is often worse 


-  The end service the customer receives is commonly the result of many behind-the-scenes ,  internal services 


-  ,  Our research shows convincingly that teamwork is  principal factor in delivering excellent service 


-  industry is to develop team energy?6 ,  Service team building cannot be left to chance 


-  Some degree of structuring ,  assigning ,  and facilitating is needed to overcome organizational inertia 


-  ,  Some firms have already formed teams to accomplish specific tasks or solve problems 


-  PHH FleetAmerica ,  the nations largest automobile fleet management company ,  is experimenting with this approach by assigning teams to serve the range of needs of selected large clients 


-  This is in contrast to the firms predominantly functional structure ,  in which various departments specialize in specific tasks  ( such as automobile procurement ,  titles ,  and disposal )  and clients deal with different units for different needs 


-  Management is placing people with different specialties together in the same unit and saying ,  Work together as  team ,  take ownership of the customer ,  and improve the way we do things 


-  This approach is promising because it combines into one package close-to-the-customer decision making ,  unified control over the service ,  andmost of allthe team energy about which Mr 


-  ,  Breaking the service promise is the single most important way service companies fail their customers 


-  When  firm is careless in performing the service ,  when it makes mistakes ,  when it doesnt do what it said it would do ,  customers lose confidence in the firms reliability; they lose confidence in the firms wherewithal to do what it promises to do dependably and accurately 


-  ,  We have learned in our research that service reliability is the service core to most customers 


-  Little else matters to customers when  company is not dependable 


-  We have now measured the relative importance of the five service dimensions in nine independent customer samples covering  variety of services 


-  In all nine samples ,  respondents rate reliability as the single most important feature in judging service quality 


-  companies are delivering service reliability is not reassuring 


-  firms ,  are more deficient on the reliability dimension than on any other 


-  ,  We sometimes hear executives say that 98 percent reliability is acceptable and that it is cost-prohibitive to do better 


-  The flip side of 98 percent reliability is  percent unreliability ,  and more than likely ,  the actual cost of  percent unreliability is higher than the cost of improving 98 percent reliability 


-  ,  If executives were to calculate the true costs of service unreliabilitylost customers ,  unfavorable word-of-mouth ,  and redoing services not done properly the first timethey would realize just how much sloppiness steals from the bottom line and that  zero defects attitude is as important in services as in manufacturing 


-  ,  And if more executives were to investigate the primary causes of service unreliability in their companies ,  they would find most of them rooted in poor service design ,  inattention to service details ,  and basic carelessnessproblems that cannot be solved by throwing money at them 


-  ,  Reliability is the heart of excellent service 


-  And it is not just the high-stake services involving our health or financial security for which we demand reliability 


-  ,  captures the spirit of  zero-defects approach to service:8 ,  Managers should use every opportunity to build  do-it-right-first attitude 


-  This means specifically addressing the reliability issue in company communications ,  including mission statements; setting reliability standards; teaching the why and how of reliability in training programs; appointing reliability teams to study specific services and recommend ways to improve reliability; measuring error rates; and rewarding error-free service 


-  ,  Service reliability is so important that we suggest companies ask each employee to make  formal commitment to it 


-  companies to work for ,  has made service reliability the centerpiece of its Commitment to Excellence statement that each employee signs 


-  Several of the clauses pertain directly to service reliability 


-  ,  One of the most important opportunities for improving reliability involves analyzing services for fail pointsthe service processes most vulnerable to mishap 


-  Firms can identify fail points by monitoring service delivery through mystery shoppers and periodic surveys; by soliciting the input of employees actually performing the service; by studying and categorizing customer service complaints; and by mapping the architecture of the service processgenerally referred to as blueprinting 


-  ,  Identifying fail points focuses attention on the need for special training ,  additional inspection ,  building in corrective subprocesses ,  or even redesigning the original process 


-  Consider the case of Florida Power  Light and its quest to reduce the duration and frequency of service interruptions ,   major cause of customer complaints 


-  Serving  part of the country that averages 80 days  year of thunderstorms and lightning ,  the company has developed  sophisticated ,  computer-based lightning tracking system to anticipate where weather-related problems might occur and to strategically position crews to quicken recovery response time 


-  This and other initiatives have enabled the utility to reduce service unavailability  ( customer minutes interrupted divided by customers served )  from 70 minutes at the end of 1987 to 48 


-  ,  Outstanding service reliability is the foundation on which to build  reputation for outstanding service quality 


-  Companies that consider the service promise inviolate are most likely to earn the confidence of their customers 


-  And the confidence of customers is the greatest asset  company can have 


-  ,  When  customer experiences  problem with  servicewhen something goes awrythe customers confidence is jarred but probably not destroyed ,  unless the problem reflects  pattern of negative experience with the company 


-  The firm can make things better with the customerat least to some extentor much ,  much worse 


-  ,  All too often ,  service companies make things worse 


-  They do not encourage their customers to resolve their problems and set up roadblocks for those who try to do so 


-  ,  Three possibilities arise when  customer experiences  service problem: ,  Of these possible outcomes ,  the first one is good and the last two are very bad 


-  Our sample companies received the most favorable service quality scores from customers who had experienced no recent service problems with them ,  the next most favorable scores from customers whose problems were resolved satisfactorily ,  and the worst scores  ( by far )  from customers whose problems were not resolved satisfactorily 


-  ,  In effect ,  companies that do not respond effectively to customer complaints compound the failure; they fail to come through for the customer again 


-  At this point ,  the customers shaky confidence in the firm probably collapses 


-  ,  Many dissatisfied customers do not complain ,  often making unflattering comments about the firm and taking their business elsewhere instead 


-  ,  organization noted for its research on customer complaining behavior ,  document that large numbers of customers do not complain because they fear  hassle ,  perceive no easy or efficient way to air their grievances ,  or believe complaining will not do them any good 


-  ,  Managers need to come to grips with the seriousness of the lost business and negative word-of-mouth that occurs when customers cannot resolve problems with the firm ,  or do not even try 


-  How  company handles service problems tells customers  ( and employees )   great deal about the firms service values and priorities 


-  ,  Managers who want to improve problem-resolution service must over come the common customer perception that companies dont really care when things go wrong 


-  The solution calls for some creative marketing of the customer feedback idea 


-  British Airways Video Point booths ,  in which disembarking passengers can videotape their concerns ,  make an unusually strong statement that the company wants to know when its customers are unhappy 


-  ,  Companies frequently make two fatal mistakes in problem resolution: They take too long to respond to customers ,  and they respond impersonally 


-  Timely ,  personal communication with unhappy customers offers  firm the best chance to regain the customers favor 


-  By responding quickly ,   firm conveys  sense of urgency 


-  By responding personally ,  with  telephone call or  visit ,  it creates an opportunity for dialogue with customersan opportunity to listen ,  ask questions ,  explain ,  apologize ,  achieve closure 


-  ,  North Carolinas Wachovia Bank  Trust has  sundown ruleemployees must establish contact with  complaining customer before sunset on the day  complaint is received 


-  In addition ,  the employees were given the name and telephone number of  person at the bank who could answer questions and resolve problems 


-  Silence is not golden when  problem exists and the customer is waiting to hear 


-  ,  Companies must market the idea of problem resolution to employees ,  not just to customers 


-  This involves many of the ideas we have already covered in the article ,  for example ,  setting and rein forcing problem-resolution standards ,  and giving employees the freedom to truly solve customer problems 


-  It is no fun trying to solve customer problems if doing so produces  small mountain of red tape or  sneer from  supervisor 


-  ,  Service employees need specific training about how to deal with angry customers and how to help customers solve service problems 


-  In some cases ,  they need access to information systems that will tell them more about the customer ,  the situation causing the problem ,  and possible solutions 


-  ,  When American Express card holders telephone the 800 number on their monthly statement ,  they talk to  highly trained customer service representative with the authority to solve on the spot 85 percent of the problems that prompt telephone calls 


-  ,  Specifics aside ,  problem-resolution excellence requires that managers view services marketing as  way of cementing customer loyalty through service and trust ,  rather than only as  way to acquire new customers 


-  In every single industry in the United States ,  there are examples of companies delivering superb service and profiting from it 


-  ,  Our objective in this article has been to frame an agenda for improving service that will strip away softness and elusiveness ,  and help galvanize management commitment 


-  The five service-improvement imperatives described here apply whether  company is small or large ,  new or old ,   pure service organization or  manufacturer that supplies product-support service 


-  What we need now is the will to set our sights higher ,  provide genuine leadership ,  and do what it takes to transform potential into achievement 


-  ,  Our service quality research program ,  initiated in 1983 under the auspices of the Marketing Science Institute ,  is still underway 


-  We have completed three major phases of our research ,  the findings of which form the basis for this article 


-  ,  Phase  was an extensive qualitative study of service customers and executives in four service sectors: appliance repair ,  credit cards ,  retail banking ,  and securities brokerage 


-  In each sector ,  we conducted customer focus-group interviews and in-depth executive interviews on issues pertaining to service quality 


-  Phase  resulted in our developing  conceptual model mat defines service quality from the customers standpoint ,  identifies the criteria customers use to judge quality ,  and outlines potential organizational shortfalls that can cause poor service 


-  ,  Phase II involved an empirical study that focused on the customer side of our service quality model 


-  In this phase ,  we surveyed nearly one thousand customers in the credit card ,  long-distance telephone ,  product repair ,  and retail banking sectors 


-  On the basis of these empirical findings ,  we consolidated the criteria customers use to evaluate service quality into five dimensions: tangibles ,  reliability ,  responsiveness ,  assurance ,  and empathy 


-  We also developed and refined SERVQUAL ,   methodology for measuring customers perceptions of service quality 


-  We also did  survey of bank customers 


-  This study involved mail surveys of customers ,  contact personnel ,  and managers in eighty-nine separate field offices of five national service companies two banks ,  two insurance firms ,  and  telephone company 


-  In all ,   , 936 customers ,  728 contact personnel ,  and 231 managers responded to our Phase III questionnaires
