-  ,  The first step in identifying potential suppliers is for  company to consider its own requirements 


-  Understanding the cultural differences among competing suppliers may be more valuable: Which ones have  culture of rapid and regular delivery of benefits to client businesses through component-based platform architecture ,  and which prefer to bundle system requirements into large infrastructure projects? ,  Evaluating  supplier involves understanding the infrastructure ,  values and methodologies it brings to its area of expertise 


-  As the suppliers grow their own critical mass of expertise in the target domain and become less reliant on transferees ,  new clients should consider whether suppliers have enough knowledge to operate in their specific context 


-  Clients must understand that failure on one front inevitably leads to failure on the other 


-  During the first year of their contract ,  Xchanging realized that there was  significant shortfall in the expected value of the transactions it handled 


-  ,  As the contract manager of an Australian public sector agency explains: Suppliers have to make  reasonable margin to stay in business 


-  ,  When considering outsourcing services ,  clients often seek qualitative as well as quantitative improvements 


-  For example ,  some managers worry about whether morale will suffer if employees are transferred to the suppliers organization or whether employees will find  new sense of purpose 


-  This involves looking for signs that the supplier understands training ,  managing and motivating people 


-  They have  lot more understanding of what drives  business 


-  They understand the cost base and how you actually get value out of  business 


-  The procurement services deal between BAE Systems and Xchanging ,  for example ,  was based on two considerations: Xchangings superior ability to attract high-level professional skills for procurement of supply categories such as office supplies ,  health plans and training; and its ability to take advantage of scale by aggregating BAEs part-time needs with those of other clients 


- s desire to access the high skills and low costs of Indias IT sector provides  contrasting example of the role of sourcing 


-  What values and behaviors does the supplier bring to technology exploitation? What processes does it employ? And what existing infrastructure does it plan to use as  base? As some BPO suppliers are finding ,  the ability to deliver improved business processes such as e-enabled HR services directly to the end-users desktop can surprise and delight their clients 


-  But it is important to look beyond well-known tools to consider the human and behavioral factors 


-   critical task was to change their mind-sets so that they became customers 


-  Rather than thinking of those who avail themselves of internally provided services as users ,  suppliers need to think of them as customers  people who make informed choices about service level ,  functionality and costs 


-  First ,  the supplier should have personal contact with  large number of end users in order to build  real understanding of how they want to use the service 


-  Second ,  the supplier should work with client managers to gain agreement on  detailed definition of the required service ,  which everyone involved with providing the service must understand 


-  Even though the suppliers capability to develop customers is considered part of its transformation competency ,  in practice this is tied more closely to the suppliers relationship competency 


-  To the managers surprise ,  the clients response was extremely favorable; the client even stated that unless the supplier achieved at least that level of revenue ,  he would consider the partnership  failure 


-  Among other things ,  this requires understanding options for sharing rewards between themselves and their clients as the plan is delivered 


-  As discussed earlier ,  it is important to provide multilevel orientation and support for transferees ,  to think of end users as customers ,  to have technology- and process-based projects that deliver service improvements over time and to have an overarching business plan 


-  However ,  clients also should assess potential suppliers based on their values and motivations 


-  In relationships in IT outsourcing ,  we found that the individuals fulfilling supplier leadership roles had  considerable impact on relationship success 


-  The contract with Supplier  has now been in effect for more than  year and is considered by both sides to be  great success
