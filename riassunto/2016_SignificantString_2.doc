-   venture capitalist who advises large financial services companies on strategy shared his observation about the anxiety his investors feel about the changes underway in their industry: They look at the fintech [financial technology] startups and see their business models being unbundled and attacked at every point in the value chain 


-   PwC survey published in 2015 revealed that 54% of CEOs worldwide were concerned about new competitors entering their market ,  and an equal percentage said they had either begun to compete in nontraditional markets themselves or considered doing so 


-  ,  Weve decided to wade in at this juncture because business model innovation is too important to be left to random chance and guesswork 


-  Some cars were inexplicably afflicted by problem after problem ,  to the point that it was accepted that such lemons were  natural consequence of inherent randomness in manufacturing 


-  Edwards Deming demonstrated that manufacturing doesnt have to be random ,  and ,  having incorporated his insights in the 1980s ,  the major automotive companies have made lemons  memory of  bygone era 


-  ,  In our experience ,  when the business world encounters an intractable management problem ,  its  sign that business executives and scholars are getting something wrong  that there isnt yet  satisfactory theory for whats causing the problem ,  and under what circumstances it can be overcome 


-  Business models develop through predictable stages over time  and executives need to understand the priorities associated with each business model stage 


-  Business leaders then need to evaluate whether or not  business model innovation they are considering is consistent with the current priorities of their existing business model 


-  This analysis matters greatly ,  as it drives  whole host of decisions about where the new initiative should be housed ,  how its performance should be measured ,  and how the resources and processes at work in the company will either support it or extinguish it 


-  ,  This truth has revealed itself to us gradually over time ,  but our thinking has crystallized over the past two years in an intensive study effort we have led at the Harvard Business School 


-  Stepping back ,  weve made  number of observations that we hope will prove generally helpful ,  and we also have  sense of the work that remains to be done 


-  ,  There are  number of lessons that managers can learn from past successes and failures ,  but all depend on understanding the rules that govern business model formation and development  how new models are created and how they evolve across time ,  the kinds of changes that are possible to those models at various stages of development ,  and what that means for organizational renewal and growth 


-  )  Collectively ,  the organizations resources and processes define its capabilities  how it does things  while its customer value proposition and profit formula characterize its priorities  what it does ,  and why 


-  ,  This way of viewing business models is useful for two reasons 


-  First ,  it supplies  common language and framework to understand the capabilities of  business 


-  They explain why ,  for example ,  Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd 


-  ,  Understanding the interdependencies in  business model is important because those interdependencies grow and harden across time ,  creating another fundamental truth that is critical for leaders to understand: Business models by their very nature are designed not to change ,  and they become less flexible and more resistant to change as they develop over time 


-  Leaders of the worlds best businesses should take special note ,  because the better your business model performs at its assigned task ,  the more interdependent and less capable of change it likely is 


-  ,  In fact ,  this pattern is so consistent and important that weve begun to think of the development of  business model across time as resembling  journey whose progress and route are predictable  although the time that it takes  business model to follow this journey will differ by industry and circumstance 


-  Each stage of the journey supports  specific type of innovation ,  builds  particular set of interdependencies into the model ,  and is responsive to  particular set of performance metrics 


-  Now ,  lets explore each of the three stages and how the business model evolves through them 


-  This is the stage at which  relatively small band of resources  (  founding team armed with an idea ,  some funding and ambition ,  and sometimes  technology )  is entirely focused on developing  compelling value proposition  fulfilling  significant unmet need ,  or job 


-  Its useful to think of the members of the founding team as completely immersed in this search 


-  The language that is characteristic of this stage is the language of questions ,  not of answers 


-  The link between value proposition and resources is already forming ,  but the rest of the model is still unformed: The new organization has yet to face the types of recurrent tasks that create processes ,  and its profit formula is nascent and exploratory 


-  This gives the business an incredible flexibility that will disappear as it evolves along the journey and its language shifts from questions to answers 


-  The innovations characteristic of this phase of the business model journey are what we call sustaining innovations  in other words ,  better products that can be sold for higher prices to the current target market 


-  The voice of the job emerges only in one-to-one ,  in-depth conversations that reveal the jobs context in  customers life ,  but listening to the voice of the customer allows the business to scale its understanding 


-  ,  The business unit is now no longer in the business of identifying new unmet needs but rather in the business of building processes  locking down the current model 


-  Data begs to be analyzed  it is the way the game is scored  so the influx of data precipitates the adoption of metrics to evaluate the businesss performance and direct future activity to improving the metrics 


-  While many factors can cause businesses to transition into the efficiency innovation phase of their evolution ,  one we have often observed is the result of performance overshoot ,  in which the business delivers more performance than the market can utilize and consumers become unwilling to pay for additional performance improvement or to upgrade to improved versions 


-  It needs to happen; over time ,  business units must become more efficient to remain competitive ,  and the shift to efficiency innovations as the predominant form of innovation activity is  natural outcome of that process 


-  Gleaning new understanding of that initial job to be done is now the long-lost ambition of  bygone era ,  and managers become inundated with data about costs and efficiency 


-  The business continued to improve how it served customers with the Next Generation series in the 1990s ,  which offered even bigger aircraft and better avionics systems 


-  Most notably ,  Boeing sold  facility in Wichita ,  Kansas ,  that manufactured the main fuselage platform for the 737 to the Toronto-based investment company Onex Corp 


- 10 ,  Given that road map ,  what is the hope for companies that seek to develop new business models or to create new businesses? Thus far in this article weve explored the journey that business units take over time 


-  And while were not sure that  business unit can break off from this race ,  we know that its parent companies can  by developing new businesses 


-  ,  Its worth internalizing the road map view of business model evolution because it helps explain why most attempts to alter the course of existing business units fail 


-  Therefore ,   crucial question for leaders to ask when evaluating an innovation opportunity is: To what degree does it align with the existing priorities of the business model? ,  Many failed business model innovations involve the pursuit of opportunities that appear to be consistent with  units current business model but that in fact are likely to be rejected by the existing business or its customers 


-  )  To determine how consistent an opportunity is with the priorities of the existing business model ,  leaders should ask: Is the new job to be done for the customer similar to the existing job?  ( The greater the similarity ,  the more appropriate it is for the existing business to pursue the opportunity 


-  )  How does pursuit of the opportunity affect the existing profit formula? Are the margins better ,  transaction sizes larger ,  and addressable markets bigger? If so ,  it is likely to fit well with the existing profit formula 


-  If not ,  managers should tread with caution in asking an existing business to take it on  and should instead consider creating  separate unit to pursue the new business model 


-  ,  This distinction helps explain the performance of the two innovations with which we opened this article 


-  Viewed through the lens of Googles business model ,   social network allowed the business to generate greater revenue and profitability by better targeting advertisements and delivering more advertisements through increased usage of its product platform 


-  It housed the business in  corporate incubator that does not report to the existing consumer automotive businesses and designed it from the outset to fulfill Daimlers core job of providing mobility ,  but without the need to convince consumers to purchase vehicles 


-  This bricks-and-clicks combination made perfect sense to Blockbusters managers ,  but what became obvious only in hindsight was that the two models would be at war with each other  the asset velocity required to maintain  profitable store network was incompatible with the DVD-by-mail offering 


-  ,  For some time ,  weve argued that companies should build  business creation engine ,  capable of turning out  steady stream of innovative new business models ,  but to date no company we know of has built an enduring capability like that 


-  We think that such an engine of sustained growth would quickly prove to be  companys most valuable asset ,  providing growth and creating new markets 


-  ,  Spot future growth gaps by understanding where each of your business units is on the journey 


- 11 Such  plan categorizes innovations by their distance from existing products and markets and specifies  desired allocation of funding to each bucket 


-  ,  The innovation team at Carolinas HealthCare System ,   not-for-profit health care organization based in Charlotte ,  North Carolina ,  performed this type of analysis and identified  need to field additional innovation efforts that reflected the organizations belief that hospitals will be less central in the health care system of the future 


-  ,  has had success viewing itself as the central ,  coordinating node of  symbiotic ecosystem of independent semiconductor manufacturers and consumer products companies ,  rather than as  traditional semiconductor company that develops and manufactures proprietary ,  standard products 


-  It does this in two ways: first ,  by incorporating knowledge across its entire ecosystem that allows it to develop optimized end-to-end solutions for customers ,  and second ,  by employing  royalty-based revenue model that ensures ARMs incentives are aligned with those of its customers 


-  ,  the manufacturer of specialty glass and ceramic materials based in Corning ,  New York 


-  Corning began inventing products to enable the growth of the LCD industry and eventually decided to exit the CRT market 


- 12 To Corning ,  businesses serve needs ,  not markets ,  and as technological or market shifts occur ,  the company continues to grow by remaining focused on the need ,  which we call the job 


-  When executives start new businesses ,  they often look at them and wonder ,  Where do  stick this in my organization? They feel pressure to combine new businesses with existing structures to maximize efficiency and spread overhead costs over the widest base ,  but this can spell doom for the new business 


-  Much M&A activity designed to change an existing business model fails because its done for the wrong reasons and managed in the wrong way ,  often resulting in the integration of units that should remain autonomous 


-  But our understanding of the business model journey allows us to see that ,  over the long term ,  the greatest innovation risk  company can take is to decide not to create new businesses that decouple the companys future from that of its current business units 


-  ,  We take great hope from the insights about business model innovation and corporate renewal that we have explored in this article  not because we believe that business units can evade or escape the journey that we have described ,  but because we believe that the corporations that house these units can 


-  There remains much to be learned about corporate renewal and the business model journey ,  but we hope that insights from the business model road map can help companies learn how to create robust corporate-level business creation engines that will renew their organizations and power growth
