-  ,   Netherlands-based developer of security software for digital media providers ,  was eager to increase its market share in the Asian market 


-  The company had been in China for nearly  decade and boasted  substantial regional office in Beijing 


-  But its market share in China was under attack from Chinese competitors ,  including China Digital TV ,  which held  40% market share compared to Irdetos 22% 


-  Despite frequent visits by then-CEO Graham Kill and the sales director ,  the company worried that it would miss out on the anticipated market growth in China and other parts of Asia 


-  ,  In Kills view ,  one of Irdetos problems was that too much power was concentrated in the head office in the Netherlands 


-  Managers there conducted themselves as if they knew best ,  and branch offices and subsidiaries tended to defer to Amsterdam 


-  ,  In our experience ,  similar narrow-mindedness holds back many organizations in their efforts to turn global presence into  real source of competitive advantage 


-  In this article ,  we explore the manifestations and costs associated with this way of thinking  and ways companies have addressed the problem 


-  Many of the things companies have done are fairly predictable ,  such as decentralizing global responsibilities ,  changing the reporting relationships ,  internationalizing senior management ,  and creating cross-national teams 


-  While this was expensive  and something Kills successor ultimately did away with in 2015  our study of the company indicated that the decision to operate out of dual headquarters provided an effective way to realign the focus of the company ,  and it had significant positive effects on Irdetos performance 


-  )  We offer  broad set of recommendations to help executives overcome the headquarters knows best syndrome and position themselves more effectively for global growth 


-  Many managers have no trouble ticking off the symptoms ,  including unrealistic demands from headquarters ,  misguided advice or directives ,  micromanagement ,  and  lack of receptiveness to subsidiary contributions and ideas 


-  At subsidiaries ,  these behaviors lead to  loss of confidence or initiative ,  defensiveness ,  reluctance to share information ,  rivalry for headquarters attention ,  and careful impression management during visits from headquarters executives 


-  Sometimes they are even intimidated ,  [and this] leads to suboptimal use of their potential 


-  Among other things ,  it results in missed sales leads ,  the loss of talented employees working in subsidiaries due to  lack of career advancement opportunities ,  an overinvestment in initiatives that are close to the headquarters ,  and an underinvestment in innovation and entrepreneurship in far-off markets 


-  ,  Our surveys of more than 500 executives working in the subsidiaries of multinational corporations reveal that most endure  domineering headquarters 


-  Typically ,  they interact with executives from subsidiaries that are closest to headquarters  ( in terms of geography ,  economic development ,  and culture )  their frame of reference is based on subsidiary managers who benefit from ample attention ,  autonomy ,  or influence 


-  ,  To counteract the centralizing force of strong home-country headquarters and develop more global mindsets ,   number of multinationals have tested solutions that attempt to change one or more of the following: ,  Such strategies may be effective in some settings ,  but Kill and other Irdeto executives felt they were not adequate for addressing their companys problem 


-  However ,  such efforts had limited impact 


-  His decision was to split the top management team between Amsterdam and Beijing 


-  In practice ,  head offices are often bastions of conservatism ,  advocating innovation everywhere but at the corporate headquarters 


-  Hence ,  we still know little about the workability of such arrangements 


-  ,  Over  five-year period ,  Irdeto took several steps to implement the dual headquarters arrangement 


-  Aside from the relocation costs ,  the other expenses were relatively minor 


-  From  management perspective ,  the company didnt have to revamp the formal reporting lines or management systems ,  although it did institute important changes in work practices to create  better balance between Europe and Asia 


-  The changes involved three things: ,  We tracked the changes in Irdetos activities closely 


-  After the company established its dual headquarters in 2007 ,  our surveys and interviews revealed measurable improvements on four fronts: increased top management attention ,  greater subsidiary contributions ,  rich lateral exchanges ,  and tighter local connections 


-  This culminated in the announcement in 2010 that the company would locate its formal center of excellence for software development in Beijing 


-  Beyond these high-profile decisions ,  people inside the company noticed more responsiveness to developments in Asia 


-  As one Asian middle manager commented ,  Now [with the CEO in Beijing] we can get prompt decisions and feedback from the senior management team 


-  ,  Because the structural change improved communication channels ,  the senior leadership team interacted more often with Asian managers 


-  Executives in surrounding countries  notably Korea ,  Singapore ,  and Thailand  reported significant gains in senior management attention 


-  As top managers interacted more with Asian executives ,  the top managers were more likely to appreciate the efforts made ,  obstacles overcome ,  and deals won 


-  Increased credibility generated greater trust ,  which ,  in turn ,  expanded the units influence and ability to make important contributions to strategic decisions 


-  Said one European IT manager ,  We have started to see  real shift in how the team in Beijing works 


-  They are pushing back more in development projects  This wont work in the Asian market 


-  Have you tried that? ,  Within three years ,  the Amsterdam and Beijing offices were operating more or less as equals 


-  For example ,  the group human resources director noted ,  The increased presence in Beijing  especially the center of excellence  has given employees the feeling that they are part of one global organization ,  rather than one managed out of  single place 


-  ,  Horizontal ties among peers across subsidiaries improved markedly 


-  Suddenly ,  Asian executives gained easy access to boundary spanners  people who could connect them to networks in subsidiaries around the world 


-  And as network connections increased ,  Asia  ( particularly China )  became more central to communication flows 


-  In the words of an Asia-based business development manager ,  The dual-core [headquarters] simply recognizes the way we work in  multicultural ,  multi-time-zone world 


-  It created  more integrated and efficient organization  one with more connections and tighter links 


-  ,  Irdetos strategy also led to improved communications with the outside world and improved perceptions about the company 


-  Our findings show that it generated more interactions with Chinese customers and ,  thanks largely to the presence of senior leadership team members ,  closer relationships with Chinese business partners 


-  The fact that Irdeto had two headquarters ,  combined with the CEOs move to Beijing ,  made  strong statement about Irdetos priorities to employees ,  customers ,  prospects ,  suppliers ,  investors ,  and other external stakeholders 


-  Several China-based interviewees remarked that the company had started to become part of the local fabric 


-   key area that improved was Irdetos relationship with local officials 


-  As Kill noted ,  Being able to drop everything and show up immediately has been very helpful in managing our relationship with the government 


-  Irdetos commitment to the Asian market also improved its relations with local universities ,  resulting in new internships and joint research programs 


-  ,  Significantly ,  Irdetos gains in Asia did not come at the expense of its business in Europe 


-  In fact ,  European executives benefited in two ways: The move enhanced the companys reputation for innovation among its European stakeholders ,  and Kills move to China pushed managers in Amsterdam to take increased responsibility for decisions ,  especially those that didnt really warrant the CEOs attention 


-  However ,  we can report that the companys revenues tripled during the four years we actively studied it ,  increasing from $70 million in 2007 to $215 million in 2011 


-  But our research indicates that two-thirds of the growth was organic ,  driven mainly by positive perceptions about the company and by its pursuit of new opportunities worldwide; Asia sales grew by 94% in 2008 ,  36% in 2009 ,  and 70% in 2010 


-  The following year the company ,  in an effort to integrate the North American acquisitions  ( which represented more than  third of its sales and employees )  ,  decided to add  third headquarters in San Francisco and to add three executives based there to the senior leadership team 


-  We were surprised by the response 


-  Most said they didnt regard it as either two-headed or three-headed but rather as  virtual headquarters led by senior managers who worked from different locations 


-  As  result ,  people said the company was able to make more effective resource-allocation decisions informed by diverse thinking and divergent points of view 


-  In 2014 ,  after eight years in Beijing ,  Kill left the company in order to move back to Great Britain 


-  He was confident that the changes were sufficiently anchored that they would not be threatened by this move 


-  Lowther is  Canadian ,  with extensive experience of working in North America ,  Asia ,  and several parts of Europe 


-  In many ways ,  he embodies the new global perspective of the company 


-  ,  Our discussions with both the previous and current management teams at Irdeto suggest that adding another headquarters served as  catalyst for breaking the domineering mindset within Irdeto and enabled it to grow in Asia 


-  ,  The recent changes are  reminder that there is no perfect structure 


-  Although the major benefits of the dual-core headquarters had been realized by 2014 in the form of changing mindsets and new ways of working ,  the coordination costs were still present 


-  It is  reminder that there often is  natural cycle to these types of structural changes ,  and we should not expect any model to last forever 


-  ,  Irdeto is  medium-sized ,  privately owned multinational corporation  and what works for one company may not be right for another 


-  Nevertheless ,  Irdetos experience offers some broad lessons for companies seeking to eliminate their local biases and become more global 


-  ,  Redistributing headquarters activities and reassigning top executives to other locations is the fastest ,  most effective organizational lever management has 


-  In less than  year ,  Irdeto saw  significant increase in the stature ,  influence ,  and centrality of the Asia market ,  which had previously been marginalized 


-  Social psychology has shown that behavior change is often  precondition for changes in attitudes and feelings 


-  People tend to act their way into new attitudes more than they think their way into new behaviors 


-  To change attitudes ,  therefore ,  companies must create new patterns of interaction rather than just relying on training and development 


-  ,  The perception of fairness is critical to reducing resistance to painful change 


-  One reason many restructuring efforts flounder is that they demand sacrifice from everyone except those at the top 


-  To succeed ,  the senior management must accept its share of the pain 


-  It wouldnt have been right for me to say to my colleagues ,  Look ,   want you to go over to China to start this initiative ,  Kill said 


-  ,  Another aspect of fairness is managing the trepidation associated with change 


-  At Irdeto ,  it was clear from the outset that some executives didnt want to participate in the program because of the intensive travel and mobility demands 


-  For those unwilling to change ,  it was important to manage the necessary transitions in  fair way; there was total clarity on the impending changes and time horizon ,  but also  chance to adapt ,  get reassigned ,  or exit with dignity  ( with outplacement assistance )  


- 11 ,  Decisive ,  top-down leadership is sometimes necessary to produce lasting change 


-  Fair processes can help render these difficult outcomes more palatable by making the case for change and engaging reluctant participants in discussions about how to achieve it and mitigate the downsides 


-  Allen showed that interaction frequency in an R&D setting declined substantially with distance  ( for example ,  colleagues on separate floors seldom interacted informally )  


-  Advances in communication technologies have done little to change this 


-  Ironically ,  virtual communication occurs most often between colleagues who frequently meet face to face 


-  With less spontaneous interaction ,  leadership teams located in different places must change how they operate 


-  Executives must make  conscious effort to connect with others regularly ,  often by scheduling appointments that span multiple time zones 


-  Its all too easy for the top team to neglect interactions and get swamped by the operational side of managing the business 


-  If meeting times arent set in advance and respected ,  the demands of the moment invariably win out 


-  Because we are so dispersed ,  we need to work hard on alignment and priorities 


-  As  result ,  its harder for everyone to fully understand the topics under discussion ,  and participants tend to judge each other more harshly 


-  ,  Companies today must use their global reach to learn from their partners in far-flung locations and to recycle that learning globally 


-  Instead of emphasizing where  company operates ,  we are now more concerned with how it manages and structures its worldwide activities 


-  They are investing heavily to meet short-term growth targets instead of developing new business models and innovations that will help them compete across their entire network
