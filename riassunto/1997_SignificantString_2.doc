-  Most of the extant frameworks in strategic management implicitly assume  benign environment that is simple and not very dynamic 


-  Yet ,  recent advances in technology ,  coupled with  global political climate that is favorable to free markets ,  have made parts of many industries such as financial services ,  health care ,  and transportation more turbulent 


-  For firms competing in these industries ,  the organizational set ,  or the number of competitive forces that  firm faces ,  has expanded ,  and technological innovations have accelerated the rate of change 


-  The larger the firms organizational set ,  the greater the complexity that it faces 


-  The existing models of competitive strategy do not help firms seeking to compete in such environments 


-   offer an alternate framework that conceives of competitive strategy as flexible commitments   paradoxical blend of early commitments  ( so vital for competitive success )  and timely exits  ( crucial for managing risks )  


-  ,   must note at the outset that not all Infocom firms experience turbulence; some are in simple ,  less dynamic niches 


-  Market leaders must face and cope with turbulence by reconceptualizing strategy ,  sharing the responsibility for strategy more broadly within the firm ,  and focusing on organizational capabilities as the real source of competitive advantage 


-  ,  There are four major clusters of Infocom industries: information providers ,  information processors ,  communication providers ,  and communication support  ( see Figure  )  


-  Information providers include firms in the media ,  film ,  music ,  and publishing industries that are primarily concerned with creating and assembling new information 


-  These firms also seek to add value by selectively archiving some of this information for future use 


-  Information processors are beginning to focus their attention on voice and moving images as well 


-  Communication providers ,  which move information ,  include transporters of voice and data  the telephone companies  ( including cellular telephone operators )  and distributors of books ,  movies ,  and other entertainment software  and the broadcasting and cable TV companies 


-  Another cluster ,  communications support ,  includes firms that provide equipment and services to support the communication providers 


-  The growing political trend toward deregulation and market liberalization has been another contributing factor 


-  In the United States ,  for example ,  the Telecommunications Act of 1996 promises to eliminate the barriers that currently separate the communication providers in Infocom 


-  ,  Technological advances have lowered many entry and mobility barriers that have historically protected Infocom industries 


-  Information will be available via  communication utility in much the same way that electricity is today 


-  The provision of this new service will call for the seamless integration of various information forms like newspapers ,  books ,  scientific and business information ,  and  broadband ,  interactive communication channel 


-  ,  Semiconductor devices can now process high-speed images and manage data communication interfaces at hundreds and thousands of megabits per second 


-  As technological performance rises ,  the price of semiconductor devices continues to drop 


-  Integration density and performance per chip has doubled every one and  half years ,  while prices have remained virtually the same 


-  Trends show that ,  every seven years ,  the cost of processing has fallen by  factor of ten 


-  Tasks that only large mainframes costing millions of dollars performed twenty years ago can now be done on machines costing  few thousand dollars; perhaps in another twenty years ,  the same power will cost only  few hundred dollars 


-  This impressive improvement in performance ,  coupled with falling prices ,  has made it commercially feasible to extend digitization of information beyond data to include voice ,  video ,  and moving images 


-  Televisions ,  on the other hand ,  have been part of many home computer setups and integral to computer-game configurations 


-  Soon ,   single telecomputer will be  fax-phone ,  radio ,   high-definition TV ,  an audio and video recorder/player ,  an image copier ,  and  computer 


-  Recent developments in Internet-related technologies will make this battle even more interesting 


-  The telecomputer of the future might actually be  cheap device without large data storage and processing capabilities that relies instead on the Internet 


-  Computer companies such as IBM and Hitachi are competing with Alcatel and AT&T for high-end telecommunication equipment like the asynchronous transfer mode  ( ATM )  switch ,  and consumer electronics firms such as Sony and Philips compete with the telecommunication equipment manufacturers on telephones ,  answering machines ,  and low-end telecommunication systems 


-  Frame relay and cell transfer technologies transmit  mixture of image ,  data ,  and voice through self-healing ,  highly reliable networks 


-  They are capable of providing  bandwidth-on-demand service 


-  B-ISDN  ( broadband ISDN )  has already enhanced the capacity of telephone networks to carry data 


-  Newer technologies like the asymmetric digital subscriber line  ( ADSL )  make it possible to squeeze even more capacity from existing twisted-pair telephone wiring 


-  The cost of producing  meter of fiber has dropped dramatically from $11 


-  Also ,  technological advances will allow wireless networks to emerge faster and offer the same capacity that wireline services offer today 


-  ,  Microsoft is an example of  firm that has exploited the wide range of strategic alternatives that are now available in Infocom 


-  The company began as an information processor ,  specializing in operating and applications systems software  ( see Figure  )  


-  For example ,  it has forged alliances with Sega ,  the video game maker ,  and DreamWorks SKG ,  the innovative film producer ,  to gain special access to distinct information content 


-  Microsoft has alliances with communication providers on interactive TV and various on-line services 


-  Bill Gates also has an interest in Craig McCaws ambitious new venture ,  Teledesic ,  that will create  constellation of 840 low-altitude satellites that transmit signals from any point on the planet with the speed and capacity of fiber-optic cable 


-  Their competitive environment has become more complex 


-  Products or companies that get ahead in such  market eventually run into limitations and reach  predictable equilibrium of prices and market shares 


-  The evolution of the microcomputer industry provides an illustration of Arthurs thesis  ( see Figure  )  


-  Tandy ,  Commodore ,  and Apple all offered complete machines ,  but Apples user-friendly operating system gave it an early lead over its competitors 


-  ,  IBMs name recognition gave it early market penetration ,  and the growing base of IBM/DOS users encouraged independent software vendors to develop new application software for the IBM PC 


-  The greater variety of application software encouraged additional users to try the IBM PC ,  which led to  virtuous cycle of more users and more application software ,  making it the industry standard ,  despite Apples arguably more user-friendly operating system 


-  As the price of the cloned PCs started dropping ,  more users flooded the market 


-  This ,  in turn ,  encouraged Intel ,  Microsoft ,  and the independent software vendors to set an ambitious development strategy ,  increasingly independent of IBM 


-  The availability of user-friendly applications further boosted PC sales ,  but now the hardware itself had become  mere commodity 


-  The World Wide Web and its system software could become the next dominant platform ,  superseding the personal computer and its operating system 


-  ,  The digitization of information allows information content providers and communication conduit companies to add value in several ways  ( Figure  shows three such approaches for  content provider )  


-  Some firms have focused on speed by providing near-instant business intelligence on  wide range of items from stock market performance ,  to patent and other scientific information ,  to presentations at public conferences 


-  Finally ,   number of innovations seek to extend the half-life of information ,   


-  ,  how long it is valued ,  through  range of archival products from technologically freshened movie classics to new databases stored conveniently and inexpensively on CD-ROMs for personal use 


-  Similarly ,  the communication providers and their respective support companies will compete to control the value added to the communication conduits  ( see Figure  )  


-  Satellite broadcasting ,  for example ,  is  one-to-many communication conduit that is not specific to any viewer 


-  This is ,  for example ,  the intent of the Teledesic project 


-   conduit is versatile if it can carry all forms of information  voice ,  data/ image ,  and video 


-  But technological advances have made it capable of handling data/image transmission and ,  more recently ,  even video signals ,  using new signal-compression technologies 


-  ATM switch technology breaks messages into packets and stuffs data packets into spaces between voice and video packets ,  thus expanding the carrying capacity of  telephone line 


-   conduit is interactive when it allows two-way communication 


-  Future technological advances are expected to remove this limitation 


-  The communication support companies ,  on the other hand ,  prefer to create these features in CPEs 


-  By going directly to the end user ,  the equipment manufacturers can bypass the power of well-entrenched communication providers 


-  The Internet is hardware independent and equally accessible to any terminal ,  whether  PC or Mac 


-  It also liberates the user from the costs and hassles of frequent software updates; the user has access to the latest version of the software on the Internet 


-  Industry watchers see  communications network that will become the primary repository of data and applications software; all  user will need for access is  $500 terminal ,  which even the game machine companies Nintendo and Sega can make 


-  Andrew Grove and Bill Gates ,  whose strategies have been aimed at increasing the power of the stand-alone desktop computer ,  point out that the low-cost ,  high-bandwidth ,  interactive communication pipelines needed to make the Internet  serious threat will be unavailable to most users globally ,  even by the year 2000 


-  ,  Actors in each Infocom cluster have different visions for its future 


-  ,  Falling entry and mobility barriers ,  increasing returns to scale ,  and frequent innovations are trends that researchers have observed in other industries 


-  DAveni defines hypercompetition ,   condition similar to the turbulence  described ,  as an environmental phenomenon in which competitive advantages are rapidly created and eroded because of dynamic strategic interactions in four areas of competition:  (  )  cost and quality ,  (  )  timing and know-how ,  (  )  strongholds ,  and  (  )  deep pockets 


-  ,  In  hypercompetitive environment ,  advantages due to  low-cost position or superior features  ( what DAveni calls quality )  are constantly challenged 


-  In the case of Infocom ,  technological innovation allows features to improve constantly even as costs drop 


-  Traditional barriers built around switching costs and captive distribution are being challenged by an open information architecture and access to  broadband communication utility 


-  DAveni sees hypercompetition as  desirable stop on the inevitable descent to perfect competition: ,  Thus ,  even though perfect competition is treated as the equilibrium state in static economic models ,  it is neither  desired state nor  sustainable state from the perspective of corporations seeking profits 


-  They would prefer low and moderate levels of competition but often settle for hypercompetitive markets because the presence of  small number of aggressive foreign corporations wont cooperate enough to allow the old ,  more genteel levels of competition that existed in the past 


-  Hypercompetition assumes  less complex environment by contrast ,  involving conflicts within and across the four areas of cost and quality ,  timing and know-how ,  strongholds ,  and deep pockets 


-  Some popular frameworks for formulating competitive strategy assume an even more benign environment  ( see Table  )  


-  ,  Porters framework is useful only if the competitive forces represented by competitors ,  suppliers ,  buyers ,  and substitutes are relatively stable and independent 


-  Then  company can find an appropriate strategy for each industry configuration and erect the necessary barriers for protecting this strategy 


-  ,  The traditional sources of competitive advantage  economies of scale ,  product differentiation ,  capital investments ,  switching costs ,  access to distribution channels ,  and government policy  have all lost their importance as barriers to competition in Infocom 


-  ,  Hamel and Prahalad argue that the role of strategy should be not to accommodate an existing industry structure but rather to change it 


- 11 They see the role of competitive innovation as identifying the orthodoxy in an incumbents strategy and redefining the terms of engagement to exploit this orthodoxy 


-  Of particular relevance to the Infocom industry is their example of  poorly resourced competitor ,  Canon ,  which successfully attacked Xeroxs dominance in the office products industry 


-  The Canon innovation ,  at least initially ,  was to offer the same or reduced functionality at substantially lower prices than the industry leaders 


-  Other competing frameworks question the determinism implicit in this approach and focus instead on the firm  its competencies ,  organizational capabilities ,  and ,  above all ,  its managerial ingenuity  as the key drivers of its strategy 


-  DAveni ,  therefore ,  prescribes  strategy that is continually seeking to change the rules of the game ,  even when  firm is successful and ahead of its competitors 


-  He extends the Hamel and Prahalad notion of competitive innovation to  continual process rather than  one-time breakthrough 


-  However ,  in departing from Hamel and Prahalad ,  he proposes that  firm should carefully guard its strategic intent from its competitors and seek instead to confuse them 


-  The primary driver of strategy is strategic soothsaying and the anticipation of future customer needs through  constant monitoring of stakeholder  ( especially customer )  satisfaction 


-  First ,  it assumes that strategic soothsaying is possible ,  and second ,  it assumes that competitive battles are won or lost by the firms own actions in the four areas of competition: cost and quality ,  timing and know-how ,  strongholds ,  and deep pockets 


- 13 While DAveni is right in pointing out that competitive advantage in  hyper-competitive environment is fleeting ,  his belief that  firm can continuously move from one advantage to the next is misplaced 


-  Arthur points out that ,  while corporate maneuvering  ( an economists term for strategy )  can be helpful ,  winners in  turbulent environment are also picked by external circumstances and luck 


- 16 ,  Companies cannot manage turbulence ,  but they can cope with it 


-  ,  The three elements of my proposed framework are: reconceptualizing strategy ,  sharing the responsibility for strategy more broadly within the firm ,  and focusing on organizational capabilities as the real source of competitive advantage 


-  On the face of it ,  the idea seems to contradict the previous theorizing on first-mover advantages 


-  In their thoughtful survey on first-mover advantages  ( and disadvantages )  ,  Lieberman and Montgomery note that  first-mover strategy has severe disadvantages when there is the possibility to free ride on an innovation ,  the technological and commercial uncertainties are high ,  and technology or customer needs are fluid 


- 18 This seems to apply to the Infocom industries 


-  The fundamental support for  first-mover strategy comes from this ever-present threat of substitution 


-  ,   strategy is viable if it can be defended by distinct resources 


- 19 In manufacturing industries ,  the primary resources that are typically used to gain competitive advantage are tangible and intangible assets ,  which are difficult to either procure or imitate 


-  For example ,  Caterpillar used its brand name ,  manufacturing capacities ,  sales network ,  and worldwide spare-parts distribution and servicing capabilities as distinct barriers that kept competition at bay 


-  In the earlier PC industry example ,  IBM succeeded in displacing Apple by introducing  new PC architecture 


-  Compaq ,   player with substantially lower assets ,  displaced IBM ,  again through an innovative product design 


-  The more recent challenges to the PC come not from asset-rich competitors but from industry upstarts like Sun and Netscape 


-  ,  Unlike the competitive context of manufacturing industries ,  in which the challenger avoids head-on competition until it has assembled an asset base comparable to that of the industry leader ,  challengers in the Infocom sectors do not show any such courtesy to the leader 


-  Each successive challenger takes the industry leader head-on by offering  product or service that offers the same or better performance at  substantially lower price 


-  Canon ,  for example ,  launched its inkjet printers despite the damage to the companys dominant position in laser printers 


-  First movers are not always guaranteed success 


-  Prodigy ,  for example ,  was the first to offer on-line services but has since lost to America Online and CompuServe 


-  In addition to being  first mover ,   firm aspiring to lead in  turbulent environment must also be quick to build  customer network centered on its product or service offering 


-  ,  For example ,  when Novell introduced NetWare ,   network operating system for connecting PCs in  local network ,  it first made sure that its product was technically superior 


-  It then discounted the product heavily to build an installed base of users and also set up special incentives to encourage software developers to write for NetWare 


-  The more software that was available for NetWare ,  the more popular it became ,  benefiting both Novell and its software developers 


-  Novell managed the cross-product positive feedbacks actively to lock in its market and ,  subsequently ,  made huge profits from upgrades ,  spin-offs ,  and applications of its own 


-  The per-user costs to  provider do not increase with the number of users; in fact ,  they may drop 


-  Also ,  networks with the largest number of consumers always provide more value to consumers than do smaller networks 


-  Therefore ,  consumers may be willing to pay higher prices to join  large network than they would pay to join  small network 


-  As more and more users flock to it ,  there is  product or service lock in 


-  ,  Some have argued that the network effects may lead to the lock-in of inferior technologies 


- 20 The lock-in of JVCs VHS format for videotapes instead of Sonys Betamax format or the dominance of the Qwerty keyboard over the rival Dvorak keyboard are examples 


-  Liebowitz and Margolis argue that ,  contrary to some suggestions ,  VHS and Qwerty were not inferior to the competing technologies then available 


-  ,  While it is important for  first mover to build  customer network early in the innovation process  ( without waiting for the perfect technical offering )  ,  its technology must be at least on par with that of its competitors 


-  Moreover ,  it must continually upgrade its product or service offering to prevent customers from switching to rival offerings 


-  Microsoft ,  for example ,  has been able to maintain its lead in operating systems by offering easy upgrades from DOS to Windows to Windows 95 to Windows NT 


-   customer network is not an asset that  firm owns but is  fickle system of influence that the firm must nurture continuously through its own offerings and the complementary offerings of its alliance partners 


- 22 Left unmanaged ,  the network can become useless very quickly 


-  On the other hand ,  as the Microsoft example suggests ,   well-managed network can be  powerful launching pad for related products and services 


-  Steve Jobss NeXT workstation ,  for example ,  was technically good but not distinctive enough to overcome the network effects of Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard in this market 


-  ,  We can compare  first-mover initiative to  financial call option 


- 23 Options create flexibility and ,  in  turbulent world ,  the ability to value and use flexibility is critical 


-  Being  first mover creates options for  firm ,  but it has to be backed by investments in  customer network in order for the innovation to pay off 


-  But ,  then ,  incentives systems must begin to reward senior managers for timely exits from markets when the flow is unfavorable to the firm ,  even as they do now for timely entries into markets when the flow is favorable 


- 25 However ,  it is difficult to define an enduring strategic intent in  turbulent environment 


-  For example ,  was NEC wise in staying with its computers and communications  ( C&C )  mission? The uncoupling of AT&Ts communication and computer businesses raises questions about the synergies between the two 


-  Perhaps NEC would have been better off if it had moved from hardware to the more lucrative software and information sectors of Infocom ,  as Sony has done 


-  ,  Collins and Porras distinguish between  firms guiding philosophy and its tangible image 


-  Purpose is the broad arena in which the firm seeks to contribute to society ,  whereas its core beliefs and values define how it will achieve its purpose 


-  Tangible image ,  on the other hand ,  consists of  mission that clearly focuses the organizations efforts and  vivid description by which the mission becomes alive and engaging 


-  The concept of strategic intent is ill defined ,  but based on the examples that Hamel and Prahalad provide ,  strategic intent appears to be what Collins and Porras call  tangible image 


-  ,  In turbulent environments ,   tangible image can be useful if it is seen as temporal 


- 27  successful coping strategy in  turbulent environment requires constant experimentation with several images until the firm finds  successful flow 


-  Holding on to one tangible image ,  no matter how carefully crafted ,  can trap  firm in  market that it cannot dominate 


-  For example ,  Silicon Graphics guiding philosophy is  computer screen that will be  window into  virtual world 


-  ,  By relying on  guiding philosophy rather than  tangible image or strategic intent ,  top management is ,  in fact ,  democratizing the strategy-making process 


-  Many firms in Infocom have flattened their organizations ,  not so much to eliminate middle managers or take advantage of advances in corporate information systems ,  but to create the small ,  highly focused units that must innovate 


-  Burgelman ,  in describing the social learning process associated with the development of  new venture ,  connects the opportunistic actions of front-line managers with the vision of top management 


- 28 The initial uncertainty concerning outcomes and the ambiguity of fit with the corporate vision is progressively reduced through an intense process of communication between frontline managers and senior management 


-  Successful entrepreneurship requires both the willingness to experiment outside  plan and the ability to communicate freely and debate openly the value of the resulting outcomes 


-   firms fuzzy vision and opportunistic actions must be reconciled in an ever-changing array of tangible images 


-  They may not shape every innovation in their firms ,  but they certainly have the savvy to evaluate innovative ideas that their frontline managers propose 


-  Grove helped move Intel out of the storage device business; and Gates was behind Microsofts recognition of the Internets possibilities and its decision to trim the companys ambitions for its own on-line strategy 


- 29 However ,  many firms competing in Infocom have deep pockets and are undifferentiated in their distinctive assets or skills 


-  Competence diversification ,  on the other hand ,  is the importing of skills ,  knowledge ,  and assets from other firms ,  building new tacit skills and know-how within the firm ,  and retiring an old competence 


-  Intel ,  for example ,  had to leave the storage device business before it could establish its world-class superiority in microprocessors 


-  In companies such as Sharp ,  competence strengthening is the responsibility of top-level functional committees 


-  Every business unit manager is responsible for competence leveraging 


-  Top management balances the relative emphasis on the three competence management capabilities by balancing the power of the various organizational units 


-  ,  The emerging Infocom mega-industry provides an interesting laboratory for testing the adequacy of existing frameworks for competitive strategy 


-   suggest that they are not designed to deal with the kind of turbulence that we are witnessing in this industry 


-  While being  first mover and an innovator will help ,  it is insufficient 


-  Investing in and growing  customer base can enhance the chances of success ,  but success in the end is determined by industry forces outside the firms control 


-  Constraining them with top-down strategic intent can be counterproductive ,  but their innovative ideas need to be channeled within  guiding philosophy   broad vision of the opportunities that the firm seeks to participate in 


-  Also ,  the added latitude given to frontline managers must be counterbalanced by  context-aware top management ,  which must know the business and be familiar with its supporting technologies 


-  Top managements skills in managing the tensions among these dynamics are  firms real source of competitive advantage 


-  Instead of worrying about designing the right strategic architecture ,  top management should devote more energy to building  proper organizational architecture
