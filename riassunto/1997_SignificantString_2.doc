-  found that the most flexible plants in their sample of printed circuit board manufacturers were those with the right combination of human resource practices ,  supplier relations ,  and product design  not necessarily those with the most advanced technology 


-  First ,  managers determine which business practices matter most for their business objectives 


-  ,  MacroMed faced critical problems in its need for greater market responsiveness and modern manufacturing methods 


-  ,  In response ,  senior managers decided to design new manufacturing equipment and to stop using the relatively inflexible equipment available on the open market 


-  Despite  considerable investment in new capital and explicit calls for new approaches to work ,  productivity did not significantly improve and ,  by some measures ,  actually worsened 


-  While they spoke of teamwork ,  empowering the workforce ,  and maintaining open ,  trusting communication ,  some managers suggested privately that operators did not really understand what was happening 


-  There were also mismatches in the skill sets of some operators ,  who lacked any desire to assume decision-making responsibility ,  just as there were mismatches in contracts with suppliers and numerous other aspects of the work 


-  ,  These complex interactions became apparent with hindsight ,  but most were not explicitly considered in advance 


-  In many change management projects ,  the most important success criterion is to start with the end in mind ,  that is ,  identify the purpose or business objective of change ,  whether it is organizational learning ,  market share ,  flexibility ,  customer satisfaction ,  or something else 


-  ,  Another guideline is to choose redesign team members for both their knowledge of functions essential to business objectives and their subsequent ability to secure support from these functions 


- 22 The change effort involved only order fulfillment staff ,  yet close examination revealed that total cycle time consumed seventy-five days of manufacturing lead time ,  eighty-five days of customer acceptance lead time ,  and twenty-two days of order fulfillment time 


-  The existing practice of designated equipment ,  for example ,  can be further broken down to sterilizing ,  manufacturing ,  and packaging 


-  ,  marketing ,  human resources ,  and manufacturing )  as well as by strategic initiative  (  


-  Line rationalization complements designated equipment by reducing uncertainty about scheduling 


-   value of +2 meant that  practice was very important ,  and  value of +1 that  practice was important but not essential ,  while  value of 2 indicated  strong desire to change or reject business as usual 


-   firm might also wish to consider  balanced scorecard involving other stakeholders and perspectives ,  including financial indicators ,  customer preferences ,  and innovation requirements 


- 31 Thus  company might evaluate the axis for flexible equipment from the additional perspectives of improving customer product offerings and of reducing financial costs 


-  Ideally ,   given metric will have quantifiable units such as accounting profits or the number of product configurations offered to the customer 


-  Similarly ,  large WIP has two complements: along the upper diagonal ,  it reinforces designated equipment and along the lower diagonal ,  it reinforces piece-rate pay 


-  In this sense ,  several management layers is the least tightly coupled practice within this block 


-  )  Interpreting the information captured in the matrix of change motivates the principles that follow 


-   system of practices with numerous reinforcing relationships is coherent and therefore inherently stable ,  whereas one with numerous competing relationships is inherently unstable 


-  The existing system at MacroMed was ,  in fact ,  quite stable 


-  ,  The desired state  ( shown in Figure  )  is also fairly stable but has  single competing relationship 


- 33 This implies that it may require more effort to keep the parts working together 


-  If  proposed state has too many negative relationships ,  the project will be unstable and must be reevaluated 


-  In the ideal case ,  completely independent blocks may be identified and removed separately ,  but in this case ,  the blocks components have less effect on the number of management layers ,  which might be changed later 


-  For similar reasons ,  introducing new technology is often used intentionally as  catalyst to facilitate change management 


-  At MacroMed ,  one manager described the dramatic unveiling of the new technology: ,  In phase two ,  we took down the walls that had surrounded the new equipment and assembled the new machines right on the manufacturing floor in their final location 


-  Because of this ,  people knew it was real and didnt want to be left out 


-  ,  Although the new technology helped achieve buy-in from the workforce ,  it was not enough to overcome the ingrained routines of the factory without  lot of additional change management 


-  In fact ,  large new blocks may be impossible to install before the opposing practices are removed 


-  In fact ,  new or greenfield sites are much more popular for introducing new systems ,  even when they require abandoning years of organizational learning 


-  Radical change is frame breaking in the sense that it requires changes in mental models of operation 


- 36  transition matrix with more densely interfering relationships can therefore indicate  greater need for changing mental models 


-  ,  Three factors help to determine the appropriate pace: task interdependence ,  organizational receptiveness to change ,  and external pressure 


-  ,  The second factor ,  an organizations culture ,  determines its receptiveness to change 


-  Particularly if change needs to migrate through several parts of an organization ,  episodic change can promote experimentation and learning so that late adopters can access the know-how and know-why of the early adopters without repeating their mistakes 


-  As one senior manager noted after the first wave of change: ,  The fact that the first effort took place in one of [MacroMed]s oldest unionized plants made the challenges surrounding the change effort all the greater; however ,  that also made the success all the more marketable in [MacroMed]s other locations 


-  ,  External pressure is the third factor 


-  Negative values in the target ratings section indicate  need to cooperate and better align incentives ,  to increase the pace and avoid drawing out resistance ,  or to isolate factions whose interests oppose the change initiative 


-  found that  tradition of open experimentation ,   willingness to invest in technology without immediate payoff ,  and  philosophy of empowerment and learning all created norms that facilitated change 


- 44 These factors influence the stakeholders willingness to cope with ,  participate in ,  and accept responsibility for change 


-  ,  The very act of asking workers for their values and taking them seriously  can positively affect the change process by giving employees  sense of ownership and responsibility 


- 47 ,  The sequence of changing practices affects not only how soon  company may realize any given payoff but also the cost and feasibility of changing other practices 


-  ,  The matrix of change can offer two forms of assistance ,  if not complete assurance ,  in dealing with complex systems 


-  In  transition from craft production to mass production to modern manufacturing ,  for example ,   company might omit the intermediate step or use it as  bridge ,  depending on the ease of the associated transitions 


- 51 The software offered controlled ,  repeatable simulations that helped identify  confluence of interacting business practices and environmental factors causing the trouble 


-  At the same time ,   surprisingly large subset of workers expressed no desire to become empowered with responsibility for programming the equipment 


-  Although this no longer increased the profitability of the factory or their individual pay ,  this and many other heuristics were too ingrained to overturn easily 


-  It isolated one portion of the factory with  temporary new wall ,  then carefully selected workers and managers for the SWAT team 


-  During subsequent phases ,  the SWAT team helped disseminate flexible manufacturing practices throughout the rest of the factory and to other plants 


-  ,  MacroMed chose to offer flat-rate compensation initially ,  while workers adjusted to their new roles and began to more fully understand the risks ,  and management gained  better understanding of the behaviors it wished to promote 


-  Other factors that eased the transition included the use of contract employees and hand-selected union workers receptive to change 


-  The changes were so successful that management ordered the windows in that part of the factory devoted to the new approach painted black to prevent visitors and competitors from seeing the organizational and technical innovations 


-  ,  Flexibility in manufacturing relies not only on powerful new information technologies ,  as is commonly emphasized ,  but also on mutually reinforcing practices 


-  Cross-training ,  incentives ,  inventory policies ,  decision-making structures ,  and open-door communication ,  among other practices ,  must function as  coherent ,  stable system 


-  MacroMed used these steps to develop  deeper understanding both of how its existing practices reinforced one another and of how practices it wished to introduce meshed with what it had done in the past 


-  ,  It is also possible to proceed in the other direction and consider aggregation through the entire value chain ,  including suppliers ,  inbound logistics ,  outbound logistics ,  buyers ,  and even competitors 


-  If environmental factors oppose one another in  triangular matrix ,  they indicate instabilities that might provide new opportunities 


-  If environmental factors reinforce one another ,  they indicate stable systems that are unlikely to change or that might change all at once;  change in regulation ,  for example ,  can shock the system 


-  It can capture new relationships as managers develop  deeper understanding of their situation 


-  Managing change without regard to context or interconnections misses what is most important 


-  Network organizations ,  in contrast ,  tend to be partnerships that exploit strategic opportunities by rapidly and flexibly adjusting their outputs to niche markets  ( seeking scope economies through complementary ,  possibly intangible assets )  and that reduce risk through equity arrangements ,  repeated cooperation ,  and trust 


-  ,  Milgrom and Roberts discuss the differences between lean manufacturing and mass production 


-  In fact ,  placing several organizational attributes from Table  into the matrix framework illustrates the difficulty of  potential business process reengineering effort  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  Although advanced information technology is typically associated with modern manufacturing more than with traditional mass production ,  it can complement practices in both systems
