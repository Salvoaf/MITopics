-  The notion that one mentor can meet all of an individuals developmental needs is often inconceivable 


-  As individuals change roles ,  occupations ,  industries or organizations ,  or relocate to different countries ,  they need to build  personal board of advisors that fits their careers and their busy lives 


-  ,  Just as corporations configure networks to deal with the variety of problems and opportunities faced by knowledge workers ,  individuals need to configure their networks based on their needs and the resource commitments involved in building such relationships 


-  That study validated the role typology we had identified in the previous two studies and provided further insights into high-potential sources of advisors and into the time and effort required to cultivate these different relationships  ( for instance ,  the type of support provided ,  the frequency of interaction and the desired relationship closeness )  


-  However ,  both the expats and the Hall of Famers also mentioned the importance of people who had passed away but continued to motivate and inspire them 


-  ,  Our findings offer  protg-based typology of supporters that is different from those developed by previous mentoring studies5 and that strongly suggests the need to expand the traditional boundaries of developmental relationships to encompass  broader set of relationships 


-  Both the type of support provided and the nature of the interaction are critical to understanding the different sources of support that personal advisory board members offer and the potential effort typically involved in developing and maintaining the different relationships 


-  )  ,   personal guide is someone who had  supportive relationship with the protg in the past ,  but the two have limited or no current interaction 


-  Personal guides may have been closer to the protg in an earlier period ,  but now they are mainly considered to be sources of psychosocial support as role models or as sources of motivation and inspiration 


-  Their support is predominantly instrumental and career-related ,  involving job or professional needs 


-  They step in only if and when developmental assistance is needed 


-  Although the relationship may have evolved from close ,  regular interaction to more occasional interaction  ( perhaps due to career or geographic shifts )  ,  this type of advisor still maintains considerable influence 


-  In analyzing the composition of the personal boards of advisors of this sample ,  our aim was to foster greater understanding of how protg-advisor interactions actually occur 


-  There are also relationships that ,  for various reasons ,  are characterized by less frequent interaction over time 


-  This indicates that tapping into relationships with individuals one already knows may be an especially good way to develop and enhance ones personal board of advisors 


-  Since building multiple effective relationships often requires both time and resources ,  individuals should consider how to secure the right personal advisory board members and how to build  developmental network that is aligned with their needs and the time and energy they have to develop the level of closeness and interaction needed to maintain  sustainable personal board of advisors 


-  The fit between an individuals needs and the network structure  ( that is ,  the match between what individuals need for their careers and psychosocial support ,  and what they get from their advisors )  is important 


-   persons developmental network cant be static but needs to evolve over time ,  based on ones awareness of the missing links between his or her needs and what his or her current personal advisory board members offer 


-  As the first component of emotional intelligence ,  self-awareness involves  deep understanding of ones moods ,  emotions ,  strengths ,  weaknesses ,  needs and effect on others 


- 13 It also involves having  clear sense of ones personal goals 


-  An individual also needs to be able to adapt as new developmental needs and priorities become evident15 or when the external environment changes  ( for example ,  when relocating to  different culture or competing at  higher level )  


-  The former enables individuals to get an accurate picture of what they need ,  while the latter enables them to initiate and cultivate effective relationships with the supporters they need 


- 16 Our studies of expats and Hall of Famers suggested that individuals who had  strong ability to relate to people found it easier to initiate and cultivate new relationships ,  secure  wider range of career and psychosocial support from personal advisory board members and provide benefits to those supporters ,  as well 


-  ,   strong developmental culture increases the chances for an individual to initiate developmental relationships with coworkers who can provide much-needed psychosocial and career support ,  particularly if the individual wants his or her career to continue in that organization or industry 


-  ,   poor fit between an individuals needs and his or her existing personal board of advisors can be divided into two parts:  lack of fit for career support  ( poor fit between desired and actual career support )  and  lack of fit for psychosocial support  ( poor fit between desired and actual psychosocial support )  


-  This relates not only to the quantity and quality of the support provided but also the time and energy available to cultivate that support 


-  At the time of our interview ,  he was considering  career change ,  citing what he saw as  poor fit with the job and  lack of career support from his peers and supervisors 


- 19 Though Robinson had helped the Reds get to the World Series and won individual awards ,  he needed support to develop his best talents 


-  At the same time ,  individuals serving as personal advisory board members begin to recognize that they are not the mentor but instead part of  support network for  particular employee  thereby making them feel less burdened or pressured to do more than they can 


-  Once employees establish their personal board of advisors ,  they dont need to feel pressure to network constantly; instead ,  they can be strategic about what kind of support they need and how close and interactive  relationship they desire 


-  Efforts to enhance personal boards of advisors are most sustainable when performance management and succession planning practices recognize and encourage individuals at all levels to invest in relationship building for the purpose of creating multiple developmental relationships in line with protg needs 


- 23 ,  Though an individuals developmental network may be constrained by organizational contexts and personal relationship competencies ,  most people still have leeway to initiate and cultivate relationships that fit their needs and priorities 


-  Creating  helpful personal board of advisors depends largely on an individuals accurate assessment of his or her strengths and weaknesses and career and psychosocial needs and goals ,  along with  realistic view of how much time and effort he or she can put toward such efforts 


-  On the one hand ,  it enables individuals to have  better understanding of the types of developmental support they need and the potential advisors they can approach 


- 30 Having high-quality relationships across differences is important in order to secure  diversity of opinions ,  information and knowledge that can be sustained over the long run 


- 33  better approach is to have different types of personal advisory board members from  variety of social realms and with different tie strengths ,  with an eye toward creating  personal board of advisors that fits your needs 


-   developmental network needs to evolve over time as ones career unfolds and ones life changes 


-  The fit between the individual and the network is based on two drivers:  (  )  an accurate assessment of ones needs and  (  )  the ability to initiate and cultivate effective relationships with the right people based on the time and effort available and the amount and depth of interaction desired 


-  But by developing self-awareness and periodically reassessing their needs ,  individuals can find advisors who can help them meet their business and personal goals
