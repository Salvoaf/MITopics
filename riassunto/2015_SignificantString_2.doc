- The turmoil of business competition has often been likened to  stormy sea 


-  In the mid-1990s ,  the winds of change appeared especially powerful ,  threatening even some of the strongest businesses 


-  Christensen ,   professor at Harvard Business School who is now considered one of the worlds leading experts on innovation and growth 


-  Good managers face  dilemma ,  he argued ,  because by doing the very things they need to do to succeed  listen to customers ,  invest in the business ,  and build distinctive capabilities  they run the risk of ignoring rivals with disruptive innovations 


-  ,  Christensens theory of disruptive innovation has gripped the business consciousness like few other ideas 


-  In  review of enduring business books ,  The Economist called the theory one of the most influential modern business ideas 


-  The theorys influence has spread far beyond the business world 


-  Christensen and his associates have proposed disruption as  framework for thinking about vexing social problems such as poverty ,  lack of access to health care ,  illiteracy ,  and unemployment 


-  The theory ,  or variations thereof ,  has been used in so many settings that Christensen himself has expressed unease with some of the ways the theory is being applied 


-  So ,  what is the right way to use the theory of disruptive innovation? What are its core elements ,  and how predictive is it? We decided to examine these questions by taking  closer look at the theory 


-  ,  Our first discovery was that ,  despite the theorys widespread use and appeal ,  its essential validity and generalizability have been seldom tested in the academic literature 


-  Christensens initial research ,  which formed the kernel of the theory ,  was based mainly on the hard disk drive industry in the 1970s and 1980s 


-  He then published  few peer-reviewed articles on the industry 


-  Other scholars have published discussions of related case examples  ( notably about Polaroid Corp 


-  ,  Smith Corona ,  and the disk drive industry )  , 10 but few quantitative tests have been performed 


- 11 The ones that have been published fail to provide confirmatory evidence for the theory ,  suggesting instead that full-blown disruptions of the type that Christensen describes are rare and that most managers respond effectively to potentially disruptive threats 


- 13 More nuanced case analysis ,  he argues ,  shows that the theory of disruptive innovation explains the failure of leading businesses ,  time after time and industry after industry 


-  ,  Spurred on by this argument ,  we decided that to understand how to apply the theory of disruptive innovation ,  we needed to delve into the case histories of dozens of disruptions identified by Christensen and his coauthor ,  Michael  


- 14 In order to examine the numerous examples and appreciate their nuances ,  we surveyed and interviewed one or more experts on each of 77 cases discussed in The Innovators Dilemma and The Innovators Solution ,  where Christensen and Raynor lay out the elements of the theory 


-  )  ,  After interviewing experts on each case ,  we had  further discovery: Many of the theorys exemplary cases did not fit four of its key conditions and predictions well 


-   handful corresponded well with all four elements  ( notably ,  for example ,  the disruptions by Salesforce 


-  However ,   majority of the 77 cases were found to include different motivating forces or displayed unpredicted outcomes 


-  Among them were cases involving legacy costs ,  the effect of numerous competitors ,  changing economies of scale ,  and shifting social conditions 


-  Discussions with our industry experts also helped us to identify the most generally applicable elements of the theory of disruptive innovation as well as to define other ways managers can guide businesses through stormy times 


-  ,  Before surveying and interviewing experts on each of the 77 cases ,  we identified four key elements of the theory of disruption:  (  )  that incumbents in  market are improving along  trajectory of sustaining innovation ,  (  )  that they overshoot customer needs ,  (  )  that they possess the capability to respond to disruptive threats ,  and  (  )  that incumbents end up floundering as  result of the disruption 


-  ,  In The Innovators Solution ,  Christensen and Raynor argue that one of the key elements of disruptive innovation is that in every market there is  distinctly different trajectory of improvement that innovating companies provide as they introduce new and improved products 


- 16 An incumbent businesss improvement trajectory results from what they call sustaining innovation  the year-by-year improvements that all good companies grind out 


-  For example ,  auto companies might continue improving the horsepower or torque of their engines 


-  As Christensen and Raynor explain ,  good managers strive to make better products that they can sell for higher profit margins to not-yet-satisfied customers in more demanding tiers of the market 


- 18 ,   second element of Christensen and Raynors theory is that the pace of sustaining innovation along the trajectory of particular value propositions almost always outstrips the ability of customers in any given tier of the market to use it 


-   Thus ,   company whose products are squarely positioned on mainstream customers current needs will probably overshoot what those customers are able to utilize in the future 


- 19 To illustrate their point ,  Christensen and Raynor use an example from the 1983 computer industry ,  when people first started using personal computers for word processing 


-   But todays processors offer much more speed than mainstream customers can use 


- 20 ,  Christensen and Raynor claim that incumbent companies frequently possess the capabilities needed to succeed ,  but managers fail to employ them effectively to combat potential disruptors 


- 21 Disruption has  paralyzing effect on industry leaders ,  they write 


- 22 Competitors with disruptive innovations lull incumbent companies into complacency by avoiding  head-to-head competition for the incumbents best customers 


-  They target instead new and low-end customers ,  Christensen and Raynor note ,  with products and services that are not as good as [those] currently available 


-  Because an incumbent companys existing activities determine its perceptions of the economic value of an innovation [and] shape the rewards and threats ,  Christensen and Raynor argue ,  managers fail to appreciate and address the potential threat 


- 24 If the disruption appears in  new market ,  incumbent businesses ignore the attackers; if among low-end customers ,  they flee the attack 


- 26 He does not specify the exact probability of failure ,  but he leaves little doubt it is very high 


-  Performance oversupply ,  he writes in The Innovators Dilemma ,  opens the door for simpler ,  less expensive ,  and more convenient  and almost always disruptive  technologies to enter 


- 27 Companies with these disruptive technologies ,  he writes ,  will always improve their products performance and in so doing eventually take over the older markets 


- 28 Once the disruptive product gains  foothold in new or low-end markets ,  Christensen and Raynor write ,  the disruptors are on  path that will ultimately crush the incumbents 


- 29 ,  We intentionally did not mention disruptive innovation until the end of our discussions with experts in order to elicit unbiased responses 


-  For many of the cases ,  experts reported historical evidence that corresponded with some elements of the theory 


-  For example ,  consistent with Christensen and Raynors claim that managers tend to ignore low-end disruption ,  an author of  book on the history of book retailing told us that higher-end bookstores had initially discounted the threat of mall-based stores 


- 31 In many other interviews ,  however ,  the experts pointed out noteworthy discrepancies between case facts and elements of the theory 


-  ,  In 24 cases  ( 31% of the total )  ,  our experts were skeptical of the existence of any meaningful trajectory of sustaining innovation prior to the emergence of  presumably disruptive innovation  ( for instance ,  market retailing before department stores ,  bazaars before eBay ,  and four-year colleges before community colleges )  


- 32 The case of large-scale meatpacking provides  good example of such an exception 


- 34 To the contrary ,  they relied on tools and artisanal practices that hadnt changed for decades 


-  Local slaughter operations were replaced ,  the experts argued ,  because of broader changes: the Union Armys demand for beef during the American Civil War ,  the expansion of the railroads ,  the scale economies provided by the use of  disassembly line , 35 and opposition by local communities that wished to see noxious slaughter operations closed 


- 36 ,  In 60 cases  ( 78% of the total )  ,  and contrary to the expectations of the theory ,  our experts thought that incumbent companies were not producing ,  or likely to produce ,  products or services that exceeded customer needs 


-  For example ,  hand animation was replaced by computer animation not because it outstripped what customers wanted ,  but because it was too expensive 


-  In the case of local area networks ,  data rates increased rapidly ,  but customers kept pace by developing ways to use the increased bandwidth 


-  In the cases of Internet search engines replacement of print directories ,  two professors at top-ranked business schools were skeptical that print directories such as the Yellow Pages had surpassed anyones needs 


- 37 Rather ,  the print directories were displaced ,  one expert noted ,  because companies producing them simply didnt have the ability to respond: There are certain situations where the economics  just dont let reasonable managers respond in  way that would disrupt the disruptor 


- 38 In other cases ,  experts noted that overshoot was difficult to achieve 


-  For example ,  when discussing whether surgery had overshot customer needs ,  thereby enabling disruption by endoscopy ,  an  


-  and expert on the business of health care asked ,  What would such overshoot look like: too little risk of death?39 ,  Prior to initiating our study ,  we anticipated that overshoot would be common in cases involving the computing industry ,  such as computer software or hardware 


-  But our experts  ( made up of computer scientists ,  historians ,  and business professors )  suggested that even here overshoot was infrequent 


- 40 They acknowledged rapid growth in computing power driven by Moores law  ( the observation by former Intel cofounder Gordon  


-  Moore that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years )  


-  But they were doubtful that this led to neglect of average or low-end consumers 


-  Incumbent companies ,  one expert noted ,  often use computing power to serve the needs of new ,  less-savvy customers  not to overshoot customer needs 


-  ,  for example ,  launched its original Macintosh in 1984 with  powerful central processing unit to enable  user-friendly graphical interface 


-  ,  In 30 cases  ( 39% of the total )  ,  our experts disputed Christensens contention that incumbent businesses were capable of responding to the disruptive innovation 


-  In some cases ,  experts argued ,  incumbents were restricted ,  even barred ,  from using their capabilities to respond 


-  For example ,  in legal education ,  Christensen points to the weak response of incumbent law schools to online legal training 


-  But there are clear limits to how far incumbent law schools can go in exploring potentially disruptive online legal education 


-  In the United States ,  the American Bar Association restricts the number of hours of online courses law schools can offer without losing their accreditation and jeopardizing the ability of their graduates to take the bar exam 


-  airlines were restricted from competing on price 


- 43 ,  In other cases ,  our experts doubted that incumbent organizations possessed the capabilities needed to compete with  disruptive entrant 


-  Christensen and Raynor imply that national postal services  ( for example ,  the  


-  by offering their own email services 


- 44 However ,  an expert was skeptical about the practicality of this plan ,  pointing out that ,  for the most part ,  executives running the postal services had very little control over labor practices and price structures 


-   similar argument can be made concerning the wood-products industry ,  many of whose products have been disrupted by plastics 


-  However ,   professor at  leading engineering school told us it was unreasonable to assume that companies with skills in silviculture and sawmill technology had the capability to compete effectively against disrupting producers of plastics 


- 46 ,  Christensen says that disruptive innovators displace incumbent leaders nearly every time 


-  They agreed that in about 62% of the cases ,  incumbents floundered as  result of  disruptive competitor 


-  However ,  in the remaining 29 cases  ( 38% )  ,  there were  range of outcomes 


-  In some cases  ( for example ,  credit scoring and business lending )  , 47 disruptions complemented incumbent businesses by supporting their existing actions 


-  In other cases ,  disruptions coexisted with incumbent businesses or allowed them to reach untapped customers  ( for instance ,  catalog sales and department stores )  


-  In still others ,  disruptions have continued to serve different markets  ( for example ,  physical and online law schools )  


- 48 ,  In summary ,  although Christensen and Raynor selected the 77 cases as examples of the theory of disruptive innovation ,  our survey of experts reveals that many of the cases do not correspond closely with the theory 


-  In fact ,  their responses suggest that only seven of the cases  ( 9% )  contained all four elements of the theory that we asked about 


-  ( See How Well Do the Cases Match the Theory? )  How can we account for this discrepancy? Clearly ,  analysis of the cases is open to interpretation ,  and one or more of our experts may be mistaken in their judgment of  particular case 


-  But even several random errors ,  given the large number of experts surveyed ,  would not significantly change our main findings 


-  ,  We concluded each of our interviews by disclosing the subject of our study and asking the expert to reflect on the theorys usefulness in understanding the case at hand 


-  ,  Some of our experts noted confusion about the presumed goal of  business or organization 


-  Christensens early work seems to imply that companies should try to maintain market share 


-  Experts familiar with this work noted that such an assumption could lead to strategies that maintained market share while harming profits 


-  In response to such criticism , 49 Christensen clarified his position in  2006 publication ,  writing that he had simply assumed that the objective function of management should be to maximize shareholder value 


- 50 This clarified objective is problematic for the 9% of cases we examined that represent nonprofit organizations or publicly regulated utilities 


-  For example ,  an author and expert on higher education noted that the access mission of community colleges often runs counter to what presidents or other leaders might do to cut costs or improve completion outcomes 


-  This expert adds: That makes it not such  great example for the theory [because] as  mission-driven institution ,  they are responsible to the public and  higher calling 


-  As described by Christensen and Raynor ,  the theory assumes that in almost every industry ,  sustaining innovation outstrips the ability of customers in any given tier of the market to use it 


- 52 The resulting overshoot of what customers can utilize ,  they write ,  opens the door for  disruptive innovation 


- 53 Many of our experts identified problems with this assumption 


-  ,  Sustaining innovation can be too slow to keep up with growing customer needs 


-  For example ,  new improvements in wood materials failed to keep pace with growing construction requirements 


-  Likewise ,  even with the development of new processing technologies ,  many postal services failed to satisfy growing customer demands for speedy home delivery 


-  In addition ,  customer needs often respond to better performance ,  altering behavior and ,  in turn ,  ones perception of needs 


-  Today ,  for example ,  many of us feel we need to carry around what are in effect supercomputers that take pictures and allow us to chat with our friends 


- 54 In some cases ,  one expert pointed out to us ,  user needs seem to be insatiable 


- 55 What would it mean ,  she asked ,  if food was too healthy ,  shelter too available ,  or education too effective? ,  When both disruptive and sustaining innovations compete to satisfy ever-increasing customer demands ,  the relative rate of improvement may be important 


-  Our experts noted several cases where disruptive innovation had sputtered or where older technologies had improved so quickly that new technologies were eclipsed 


-  For example ,  in 2003 ,  Christensen and Raynor predicted that ultrasound technology would disrupt radiation imaging 


-  Innovations in radiation imaging  ( for instance ,  X-ray tomography )  ,  followed by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging  ( MRI )  ,  have relegated the use of ultrasound to specialized applications such as prenatal care 


- 57 ,  Indeed ,  the assumption that disruptive innovations always beat sustaining ones has led Christensen to make  number of erroneous predictions 


-  For example ,  in an early publication ,  Christensen and Joseph  


- 5-inch format would be displaced by new competitors 


- 58 When Gary Marks ,  then vice president for disk drive marketing at hard drive manufacturer Conner Peripherals ,  publicly disagreed ,  Christensen and Bower replied that Marks was making exactly the mistake we warn against 


- 5-inch disk drives dominate the industry ,  and  


-  ,  Joseph Schumpeter argued that waves of creative destruction were  vital part of any economy because they washed away businesses with obsolete capabilities 


-  By contrast ,  Christensen argues that leading companies often have the resources and abilities needed to succeed but lack the values ,  modes of interaction ,  and decision making to do so 


- 60 However ,  such confidence is belied by the trials encountered by many of the 77 cases we studied 


-  Several of the companies had to navigate fundamental transitions in technology  ( for example ,  from flat-glass to roll-film photography ,  or travel agents to online services )  ,  and others had to make the difficult transition from analog to digital technologies  ( for instance ,  from vacuum tubes to liquid crystal displays ,  physical mail to email ,  hand drawing to digital animation )  


- 61 ,  Christensen and his collaborators argue that managers are doing an excellent job satisfying their high-margin customers in their existing business but are myopic about the threats posed by low-end customers or new markets 


-  In fact ,  in several of the cases we examined ,  poor management left even high-end customers dissatisfied 


-  For example ,  by the time Honda Motor Co 


-  entered the United States with  line of inexpensive offerings for the  


-  motorcycle market ,  Harley-Davidson Motor Co 


-  was already being criticized by some of its customers for poor reliability 


-  ,  Christensen assumes that managers are myopic when it comes to making good choices about new markets created by disruptive innovations 


-  His own research and that of others showed that most managers made choices that were aligned with their capabilities 


-  Businesses with the capabilities needed to compete tended to adopt disruptive innovations 


-  Weaker businesses tended to play out their hands by maximizing their returns in declining existing markets 


-  On average ,  he said ,  managers make the right choices 


- 64 ,  In several cases ,  the right choice for an incumbent may have been to avoid competing with  disruptive innovation 


-  Speaking of the airline industry ,  for example ,  one expert said ,  The biggest contrast between the Christensen model and what happened with the airlines is that [Christensen says] the barrier is somehow cognitive 


- 65 Switching to  low-cost ,  point-to-point airline business model would have required  dramatically different fleet of airplanes ,  new workers ,  new airports ,  and new gates 


-  Sometimes [stuff] happens ,  he argued ,  and the best response is to adapt but not dramatically change the business model 


- 66  business professor and expert on digital electronics made  similar point about the transition from television tubes to digital displays 


- s losses in the display market and argued that managers should have recognized their lack of advantages and prepared to exit rather than fighting to defend Sonys position 


- 67 ,  Is there  better explanation than the theory of disruption for the patterns of success and failure across the 77 cases Christensen and Raynor cite? Having argued that one theory is not adequate for explaining so many diverse cases ,  we are cautious about overreaching 


-  Nevertheless ,  from our conversations with academics and industry experts ,  we have identified some rough patterns that could provide  starting point 


-  These patterns revolve around legacy costs ,  changing scale economies ,  and the laws of probability 


-  For example ,   


-  steel company managers ,  protected from foreign competition by trade legislation ,  agreed to labor contracts that included expensive health care and pension provisions 


-  ,  Fortune writer Carol Loomis explained the deadly spiral as a demographic nightmare ,  in which an ever-shrinking number of active employees were charged with making profits sufficient to support the present and future of an ever-growing number of retirees and dependents 


- 69 Our experts told us that such legacy costs played  similarly critical role in several other cases ,  including automobiles ,  motorcycles ,  food processing ,  and transportation 


- 70 ,  In at least 40% of the 77 cases ,  changing business conditions increased the economic advantages of scale and thereby limited the number of businesses that could profitably serve the market 


-  The resulting disruption was really  well-known economic process that selected for  few well-placed businesses ,  incumbents and entrants alike ,  that could best leverage scale economies 


-  For example ,  we mentioned earlier that the expansion of national railroads allowed  few meatpacking plants to harness economies of scale and drive down costs 


-  Previously ,  such scale advantages had been constrained by the inability to ship meat long distances ,  but the expansion of railroads and the availability of railcars with ice removed these barriers 


-  Before the tremendous growth of e-commerce ,  Borders Group Inc 


-  leveraged economies created by the superstore format to gain  competitive advantage over smaller bookstores and mall-based chains 


-  Because online sales costs continually fell with volume ,  whoever gained an initial advantage was likely to take the entire market; it didnt matter whether it was  startup or an incumbent 


-  Changing scale economies turned legacy investments in superstores into  liability 


-  business school told us ,  [T]he problem for Borders was that they needed all of their customers ,  and so when Amazon started to siphon them off they simply couldnt cover fixed costs 


- 73 ,  When network externalities provide  broad scale advantage ,  some businesses are faced with  winner-take-all competition 


-  Brian Arthur has demonstrated that in such competitions ,   few early sales can initiate  feedback loop of network advantage that tips all customers to one supplier 


- 75 To gain future scale economies ,  customers joined the DOS standard ,  further entrenching Microsofts position 


-  Eventually ,  the scale benefits became so great that even superior operating systems such as Apples MacOS could not gain significant market share 


-  ,  Sometimes incumbents are simply outnumbered by the sheer quantity of new competitors 


-  In at least 30% of the 77 cases we considered ,  new infrastructure and changing demographics caused an expansion of business opportunities and  gold rush search for the best business models 


-  Because of their numbers ,  however ,  new entrants were able to cover more ground in the aggregate 


-  The laws of probability thus said that in most cases new entrants would stake the best claims and be the biggest winners 


-  ,  For example ,  the construction of highways following World War II greatly stimulated the development of roadside America 


- 76 New forms of service franchising inspired hundreds of food service chains to enter the market with different offerings and business models 


- 77 So many investors rushed in that speculators even created financial instruments for investing in franchise models 


-  Although many of the old chains  ( such as Howard Johnsons and Dairy Queen )  managed to survive ,  some of the new companies  ( such as McDonalds and Burger King )  proved to have selected better franchise models and eventually emerged as the biggest winners 


-  Because online business required little investment in physical assets ,  almost anyone could start an online company 


-  Existing businesses once again explored promising new business models ,  but because they were fewer in number ,  they couldnt stake as many claims as the swarms of entrepreneurs 


-  Although the majority of online startups would ultimately fail ,  their sheer numbers meant that some of them would strike it rich 


-  Instead ,  managers need to evaluate difficult problems from  number of different perspectives 


-  Rather ,  we recommend using its best parts in addition to classical approaches to strategic analysis 


-  Many of our experts noted examples of managers who overlooked or misunderstood the importance of an emerging threat 


-   professor of business innovation told us ,  for example ,  that managers working in relationship management software had overlooked the threat posed by Salesforce 


-  In many other cases ,  managers in incumbent companies misunderstood the value of innovations by rivals 


-  Later ,  according to an industry historian who has chronicled this story ,  they all slapped their foreheads  and said ,  Oh man ,  we really screwed up back then 


- 79 Similarly ,  although managers at Xerox didnt completely neglect the market for self-service copiers ,  they do seem to have misunderstood the value of Canons dry-toner innovation in reducing service costs and customer inconvenience 


-  Christensens theory was inspired by an industry that he admits is highly unusual; as he wrote ,  nowhere in the history of business has there been an industry like disk drives ,  where changes in technology ,  market structure ,  global scope ,  and vertical integration have been so pervasive ,  rapid ,  and unrelenting 


-  He suggests that few other industries offer researchers the same opportunities for developing theories 


- 81 Perhaps so ,  but the theorys unusual birthplace suggests the need for an evaluation of similarities between the disk drive industry and any setting where theory is to be applied 


-  One business school professor told us ,  Here is what  tell my students who label everything  disruption 


-  Where is the improvement curve? Because the fundamental assumption of the theory is that the improvement curve [the rate of sustaining innovation by incumbents] is going up faster than the consumers ability to absorb those improvements 


- 82 This assumption is critical ,  the professor explained ,  because it drives vital parts of the theory of disruption ,  such as the expectation that disruptive threats will emerge among low-end ,  overserved customers 


-  ,  Even when there is  rapid improvement curve and potential for the improvement to exceed customer needs ,  the theory of disruptive innovation should be considered  warning rather than  prediction 


-  The theory describes case examples of dysfunction and failure ,  not what the average business may do 


-  For example ,  an expert in  top-rated technical school told us that his research on the disk drive industry suggested that the case of one disk drive company ,  Seagate Technology Inc 


- 5-inch disk drives ,  and as  result ,  it was temporarily displaced from leadership in the industry 


-  Yet most of the time ,  Seagate and other companies responded effectively to presumably disruptive threats 


- 83 Thus ,  the theory provides  good reminder of potential pitfalls ,  he argued ,  but in no way does it predict what most companies will do 


-  ,   telling example of how risky it can be to use the theory to predict the behaviors of incumbent companies can be found in  teaching case ,  coauthored by Christensen himself ,  describing  startup company with an idea for developing  very thin camera 


-  The companys management knew it could not compete with established companies if they chose to make  similar product 


-  However ,  management hoped that the disruptive nature of the companys credit card camera would cause big players to ignore them 


-  Unfortunately ,  an established competitor noticed the product and jumped into the market with  superior offering 


- 84 Contrary to what the theory predicted ,  the startup ,  not the incumbent ,  was driven from the market 


-  ,  Given the evidence that the theory has limited predictive power ,  how should managers react to the appearance of potential new rivals? We propose  fairly straightforward diagnostic based on authenticated modes of analysis 


-  Second ,  they should find ways to leverage existing capabilities 


-  ,  Christensen and his collaborators seem to assume that no matter what industry or market  company is in ,  it should fight to maintain control 


-  In many of the 77 cases ,  factors such as low barriers to entry ,  the emergence of substitutes ,  and an increase in the number and aggressiveness of rivals turned once-profitable industries into profitless deserts 


-  Indeed ,  choosing to fight without studying the options violates  basic principle of strategy: The first step in responding to any major innovation is assessing whether the industry continues to be an attractive place to compete 


-  When industries become structurally unattractive ,  it may be time to plan an organized retreat 


-  Shih has studied the challenges that businesses with analog technologies faced in responding to new digital technologies 


-  Such transitions are competency-destroying ,  he writes ,  because the capabilities ,  tacit knowledge ,  and experience base of the incumbent analog firms are rendered irrelevant 


-  As  result ,  Shih argues ,  companies should evaluate the potential for profits in  new market before they jump in 


- 87 If current capabilities can be used or extended ,  it may make sense to expand into  new market 


-  ,  for example ,  expanded from books to other vertical markets where it was able to command some advantage from online sales 


-  However ,  companies need to pay attention to the potential synergies between existing and new businesses 


-  ,  Sometimes choosing the right way to use capabilities means reconsidering the existing identity of the organization 


- 88 Consider the case of Eastman Kodak Co 


-  According to popular opinion ,  Kodak failed because it didnt move aggressively and effectively enough into digital imaging 


-  ,  according to this view ,  succeeded because it developed  successful line of digital cameras 


-  However ,  the reality is that this version of the story is  myth 


-  Fujifilm survived not because it developed  new line of digital cameras but because it used its capabilities in chemicals and information technology to develop successful products and services in coatings ,  cosmetics ,  and document processing 


-  Fujifilm continues to make  few cameras ,  but it barely recoups its operating costs 


- 89 It is prospering not because it defended its position in imaging ,  but because it expanded into other areas 


-  ,  The prospect of an entrepreneur with new technology potentially disrupting incumbent businesses can make managers wary of cooperating with entrants 


-  In several of the cases we explored ,  however ,  incumbents recognized the potential for working with new entrants 


-  ,  for example ,  responded to the emergence of computer animation by cooperating with and eventually acquiring Pixar Animation Studios 


-  Disney could have continued to compete with Pixar and tried to drive it from the market ,  but Disney managers wisely recognized that their companys strengths were in marketing ,  distribution ,  and creating positive experiences at parks ,  cruise ships ,  and resorts; Pixar ,  by contrast ,  was  content developer 


- 90 Many pharmaceutical companies routinely use  range of approaches ,  including cooperation ,  when facing competition from biotech startups 


-  Rather than seeing every biotech company as  potential disrupter ,  pharmaceutical company executives often cooperate with biotech startups to leverage their own strengths 


-  ,  There is nothing radical about employing such classic approaches to strategic analysis 


- 91 But doing so is an excellent way to cede your businesss competitive advantage to more competent competitors 


-  High-level theories can give managers encouragement ,  but they are no replacement for careful analysis and difficult choices 


-  Should  company stay in the fight in  particular market and incur the cost of doing so ,  or should it exit the market and see those revenues vanish? Should  company invest in  profitable but declining business ,  or should it turn away? Is the best course to maximize returns by letting the business slowly die? These are heart-wrenching choices 


-  Following simple theories or using quick analogies may provide  sense of certainty ,  but they are no substitutes for careful ,  fundamental analysis of the nature of competition and the sources of competitive advantage
