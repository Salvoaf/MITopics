- If you ask most Americans what they know about the Endangered Species Act  ( ESA )  ,  they will likely respond ,  the spotted owl 


-  This Pacific Northwest controversy epitomizes the conflict between jobs and the environment that the ESA has come to symbolize 


-  To protect the spotted owl ,  large tracts of federal lands were withheld from logging ,  the supply of raw timber decreased ,  mill capacity was eliminated ,  logging jobs were lost ,  and prices increased 


-  As this example illustrates ,  endangered species protection can alter local ,  regional ,  and national economies 


-  It also shows the kind of win-lose negotiations that typify ESA debates 


-  Each side in the debate sees beating the other as the way to achieve its goals 


-  Environmentalists want  better environment and are willing to sacrifice economic development toward that end 


-  Development interests want economic growth and consider it unacceptable to forfeit jobs or economic prosperity for species protection 


-  ,  As species protection is weakened ,  we move toward satisfying development interests at the expense of environmental interests 


-  As species protection is strengthened ,  we move toward satisfying environmental interests at the expense of development interests 


-  Undoubtedly ,  such  tug-of-war debate will always persist ,  but we argue that there are opportunities to expand the scope of debate ,  finding solutions that will improve the potential outcome simultaneously for both environmental and development interests 


-  ,  In the managerial negotiations literature ,  scholars used to argue over whether to follow  win-lose philosophy or  win-win philosophy 


-  But more recent formulations argue that either is costly 


-  Rather ,  rational negotiators now think about how to first create  larger pie and then claim  significant portion of that pie ,  subject to concerns for fairness and the ongoing negotiation relationship 


-  But environmentalists and developers are still trapped in win-lose debates 


-  While political debates have fueled the dichotomy between environmentalists and development interests ,  we see the need for  balanced perspective to manage the two sets of concerns simultaneously 


-  We then argue that ,  when viewed from  broad economic perspective ,  the benefits derived from nature can ,  under certain circumstances ,  create mutual gain solutions for both economic and environmental interests 


-  It becomes clear that it is not the objectives of the Endangered Species Act that cause economic dilemmas but its implementation 


-  To that end ,  we offer practical ways to improve ESA implementation 


-  ,  In species protection debates ,  public opinion is often formed by anecdotes rather than by the substance or objectives of legislation 


-  The attention that the ESA garners centers on costs to individual landowners and ignores the aggregate economy 


-  For example ,  Ben Cone ,   forester in North Carolina ,  shifted from  sixty-year tradition of sustainable forest management to clear-cutting when he feared finding the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker on his property 


-  Clearly ,  this is not the solution that the ESA intended 


-  But this kind of image captures national attention and comes to symbolize ESA outcomes 


-  In reality ,  it was not the acts implementation that caused Cones actions but rather his misperceptions ,  which precipitated  hasty reaction 


-  Only after the story became  touchstone for ESA critics was it revealed that endangered species considerations affected only 15 percent of Cones land 


-  Furthermore ,  the Fish and Wildlife Service  ( FWS )  repeatedly offered Cone habitat conservation proposals ,  insulating him from future ESA responsibilities ,  but he refused to cooperate ,  fearing further economic loss 


-  Cones fear of the complete devaluation of his assets led him toward  radical protective strategy 


-  In 1973 ,  the ESA was created to protect endangered or threatened species and restore them to  secure status in the wild 


-  Each agency maintains  list of plants and animals considered worthy of protection under the act 


-  Species listed as endangered are at risk of extinction throughout all or  significant portion of their range 


-  Those threatened are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future 


-  Further ,  it becomes illegal to kill ,  harass ,  possess ,  or remove the protected species from the wild  ( taking  species )  


-  Section  is administered through an interagency consultation process ,  in which the FWS or NMFS gives biological opinions to development and permitting agencies on proposed action 


-  ,  Of the 781 domestic species for which the FWS was responsible as of May 1993 ,  the majority lived on private land  ( see Figure  )  


-  Although no court has ever found that operation of the ESA has taken private property in violation of the Fifth Amendment ,  the costs associated with endangered species protection are real ,  at times resulting in significant economic impacts at the local and regional level 


-  Economic effects are due to:  (  )  delays from providing permits and petitioning ,  (  )  alterations to development plans to accommodate endangered species protection ,  and  (  )  in the most extreme cases ,  job loss due to endangered species restrictions 


-  The last category is the most visible ,  but all three incur economic costs to private developers 


-  To balance the objectives of species protection and economic development ,  section 10 of the ESA allows private landowners to formulate habitat conservation plans  ( HCPs )  


-  Stephen Meyer ,  director of the Environmental Politics and Policy Center at MIT ,  studied the impact of endangered species listings on state economies and the agricultural sector 


-  He found that ,  first ,  endangered species listings have not depressed state economic development activity as measured by growth in construction employment and gross state product and ,  second ,  the assertion that the Endangered Species Act has harmed the American farmer ,  hobbled agricultural production ,  and decimated the forest industry is baseless 


-  And the number of projects hindered by ESA implementation between 1987 and 1995 is very small  ( see Figure  )  


-  As  result ,  in the ensuing debate ,  some had an interest in resisting and trying to delay this market transformation ,  while others quietly capitalized on the opportunity it created 


-  Some in the forestry industry deftly placed blame for their economic circumstances on the ESA ,  while others successfully adapted to its goals by formulating HCPs  ( for example ,  Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek )  or implementing sustainable forestry techniques  ( for example ,  Collins Pine Co 


-  Despite  cutback in timber use ,  most timber-dependent counties report rising property values ,  increasing timber wages ,  and an overall increase in jobs 


- 11 Tom Powers ,   University of Montana economist ,  recently reported that from 1988 to 1994 ,  jobs in the region grew by 18 percent ,  contrary to dire predictions 


-  An accurate appraisal of the costs of endangered species protection should also consider the external effects of individual development decisions 


-  For example ,   timber sale by the Bureau of Land Management  ( BLM )  in southern Oregon would allow increased logging ,  which the NMFS has determined would adversely affect the nearby Umpqua River ,  the centerpiece of  $36 million sports-fishing industry and the habitat for the threatened Umpqua cutthroat trout 


-  Portions of the river are part of the Wild and Scenic River system ,  which supports rafting ,  sightseeing ,  and ,  most economically important ,  fishing 


- 13 Traditional land-use decision making has often been ineffective in forcing developers to consider the external costs of individual actions 


-  Ironically ,  the decision-making processes of the ESA have provided interactions in which one economic interest can influence the actions of another 


-  ,  Other tangible economic benefits are associated with endangered species protection 


-  Some are direct ,  while others are more generalized benefits of ecosystem protection for which endangered species are useful indicators 


-  Here we highlight five areas that illustrate the broader economic potential of endangered species protection: pharmaceutical products ,  advanced materials ,  food production ,  flood control and drinking water filtration ,  and recreation 


-  Nature has already done the testing; labs can replicate it only at high cost and still not match the number of generations of product variability that evolution has provided 


-  Hence it is more cost-effective to look for new products with benefits to humans in nature than in the artificial ,  costly lab environment 


- 15 Taxol ,   promising treatment for ovarian and breast cancer  ( which kills approximately 40 , 000 women per year )  ,  comes from the bark of the Pacific yew tree ,  found primarily in endangered ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest 


- 16 The rosy periwinkle ,   native of  seriously endangered habitat in Madagascar ,  provides  critical component in the treatment of childhood leukemia and Hodgkins disease 


- 18 The National Cancer Institute is now studying four plant compounds that protect against the replication of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses 


-  Beyond the simple respect for diverse life forms ,  prudence and responsible management would dictate the protection of species for which we can find no current direct use 


-  ,  So valuable are the potential medicinal benefits that pharmaceutical companies are investing in biological diversity protection 


-  For example ,  in 1991 ,  Merck and  Costa Rican biological diversity organization called Instituto National de Biodiversidad  ( INBio )  agreed to catalogue all plants and animals in Costa Rica 


-  In exchange for the right to screen the results of this chemical prospecting ,  Merck pays INBio $1 million up front and royalties on any drug developments; 10 percent of the initial fee and 50 percent of the royalties are used for conservation and biological diversity protection through an arrangement with the Costa Rican government 


- 21 ,  In another example ,  Shaman Pharmaceuticals of San Francisco ,  California ,  sends medical anthropologists to work with indigenous peoples of Central and South America ,  Africa ,  and Southeast Asia to identify plants used for medicinal purposes 


-  In an industry where speed to market can mean success or failure through the control of crucial patent rights ,  Shaman foresees that this targeting will help it bring drugs to market in seven to eight years ,  compared with the industry average of ten to twelve years 


-  For example ,  biopolymers ,  which are stronger and more lightweight and biodegradable than synthetics ,  are derived from microbial systems ,  extracted from higher organisms such as plants ,  or synthesized chemically from basic biological building blocks 


-   wide range of emerging applications include medical materials ,  packaging ,  cosmetics ,  food additives ,  clothing fabrics ,  water treatment chemicals ,  industrial plastics ,  absorbents ,  biosensors ,  and even data storage elements 


-  For example ,   National Research Council report states that salmon hatcheries ,  once thought to be key to survival ,  are pushing many naturally spawning salmon species to extinction by inadequately maintaining the unique biological traits of hundreds of salmon varieties that eventually could become endangered 


-  One ,  the endangered Mexican wild corn ,  is immune to  serious agricultural viral corn disease 


-  Furthermore ,  through cross-fertilization ,  new types of strains can be created as well 


-  For example ,  crossing corn with an endangered grass from Mexico produced  corn strain with increased resistance to Northern leaf blight 


-  In response to the 1993 floods that killed 50 ,  left 70 , 000 homeless ,  and caused farm and property losses in excess of $10 billion ,  researchers and the government are beginning to realize that reserving bottom land for wetland conservation is more cost-effective in controlling floods 


-  Thus far ,  federal expenditures of nearly $250 million have been allocated to buy more than  , 000 bottom-land homes from Midwesterners willing to move 


-  As such ,  endangered species can signal when ecosystems are in crisis ,  much like the canary in the coal mine 


-  For example ,  the threatened Ozark cavefish is an indicator of water quality in the region; efforts to protect the cavefish also provide  valuable monitoring system for protecting the water supply 


-  The needs and desires of an increasingly urban and environmentally concerned population are supplanting the traditional interests of logging ,  mining ,  and grazing 


-  The 1990 census showed that the West  ( the location of nearly all BLM and much of Forest Service land )  has become nearly as urban as the Northeast ,  with more than 83 percent of its residents living in cities 


-  billion-a-year economy and are responsible for millions of jobs in the United States 


-  The number of hunters has similarly increased  percent ,  with  corresponding increase in expenditures of  percent to $12 billion 


- 33 Leading the list ,  birding has become one of North Americas fastest-growing hobbies ,  with enthusiasts spending $18 billion  year on travel and equipment 


- 34 ,  Some corporations and landowners have capitalized on this trend 


-  For example ,  International Paper has implemented  fee-based recreation program in its commercial forests in Texas ,  Louisiana ,  and Arkansas 


-  This shift ,  and the reality that 73 percent of sportsmen consider themselves to be conservationists ,  has led the countrys environmental and conservation groups ,  such as the Sierra Club and the National Audubon Society ,  to form coalitions with hunting and sporting groups 


- 36 Constituting  powerful economic and political interest block ,  many sportsmen now oppose the efforts of logging ,  mining ,  and oil interests to release federal lands to state control for fear that they will be sold and lost to sporting interests 


- 37 ,  Cities and states are also tying economic prosperity to ecosystem protection 


-  It plans to create  wildlife sanctuary that the local community expects will attract bird-watchers and hikers 


- 39 ,  Not all the value of endangered species is tangible 


-  For example ,  economists have priced the annual  ( nonmarket )  benefits of spotted-owl protection in excess of $1 billion ,  which represents the popularity of endangered species protection among the  


- 41 In the same survey ,  63 percent opposed any reduction in protecting endangered species; 59 percent opposed the expansion of logging ,  mining ,  and ranching on public land; and 67 percent were against opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to gas and oil exploration 


- 42 ,  We are not arguing that economics should be the sole criterion for determining the merit of endangered species protection 


-  Clearly ,  the economic costs of protection are often overstated ,  and the direct and indirect economic benefits are often understated 


-  Indeed ,  when viewed more broadly ,  environmental protection is an important component of economic systems ,  both in providing natural capital and in inducing economic transitions that promote efficiency and productivity over the long term 


-  ,  In building the natural resource base of democracy in the United States ,  Thomas Jefferson noted ,  The greatest service which can be rendered any country is to add  useful plant to its culture ,  especially  bread grain 


-  ,  It is inconsistent to argue that we are morally obligated to ensure that future generations are not burdened with massive debt and then not ensure  sound resource base and  stable living environment 


-  Responsible economic foresight necessitates present-day ecosystem management 


-  As plants and animals become scarce ,  the costs of protecting them rise exponentially 


-  While the spotted-owl case was  costly effort to protect an endangered species ,  it was also  mistake that could have been avoided ,  had the agencies and interest groups dealt with the underlying issues early and proactively 


- 44 ,  Including natural capital in the conception of  healthy economy introduces the notion of environmental protection as necessary to economic management 


-  For example ,  declining eagle populations in the 1960s signaled an ecosystem overburdened by DDT spraying 


-  ,  Economic transitions are underway at all times 


-  For example ,  the typewriter industry was virtually eliminated by the computer ,  the compact disc replaced the phonograph album ,  and the dissolution of the Bell system wrought structural changes in the telecommunications industry 


-  With changing federal forest management due to spotted-owl protection ,  price fluctuations have made steel studs an economically viable alternative to framing lumber in new-home construction and have stimulated  new ,  more sustainable market in engineered wood products 


-  ,  The protection of endangered species promotes economic transitions designed to protect the natural resource base 


-  By moving away from  purely extractive view of natural resources ,  it shifts us toward stewardship 


-  For example ,  the diminishing supply of large timber from old-growth forests signals that this resource will eventually be exhausted and that an economic transition may occur 


-  ,  Any assessment of the economic implications of endangered species protection must include the long-term interests of diverse stakeholders to communicate economic transitions and develop alternative strategies consensually 


-  Most people have the common ,  unfortunate perspective that what is good for the other side is bad for us in terms of the economy and the environment 


-  But ,  to the extent that environmental and economic interests weigh issues differently ,  we can find new opportunities by shifting our mind-sets 


- 45 ,  According to  1995 poll ,  69 percent of Americans believe that environmental protection and economic development can work together 


- 46 Some companies are following the trend 


-  million in reduced manufacturing costs 


- 48 ,   shift in mind-set is critical if the ESA is to enhance economic competitiveness rather than diminish it 


-  As Howard Raiffa explains: We must recognize that  lot of disputes are settled by hard-nosed ,  positional bargaining 


-  But efficiently settled? Often not 


-  There may be another carefully crafted settlement that both [parties] might prefer to the settlement they actually achieved 


-  For example: ,  Under sections  and 10 of the ESA ,  federal agencies can negotiate the provisions of their projects to ensure that they do not jeopardize endangered species and can expand this process to private landowners 


-  HCPs are  way for companies to develop plans that serve the interests of the endangered species and the proposal 


-  ,  An enhanced Endangered Species Act that will integrate economic and environmental interests must have three objectives: first ,  it must work within the market system to create individual incentives for protecting biological diversity; second ,  it must foster an inclusive regulatory program that incorporates the interests and needs of all affected parties; and third ,  it must evolve beyond the single-minded focus on individual species and consider the whole ecosystem 


-  Relevant parties in the debate must acknowledge that the environment and the economy are intertwined 


-  ,  To improve the implementation of the ESA ,  we propose:  (  )  the promotion of economic incentives ,  (  )   reduction in the uncertainty facing affected groups ,  (  )  the allocation of adequate resources ,  (  )  more stakeholder involvement in the ESA decision-making process ,  and  (  )   move toward ecosystem-based management 


-  To make the ESA consistent with this ,  we should incorporate policies to harness the power of the marketplace so landowners and corporations find it in their interest to protect biological diversity based on properly adjusted prices 


-  The policies include tax incentives  ( estate ,  property ,  and income )  ,  special trust funds ,  transfer of critical habitat from private to public control ,  and user fees on federal lands 


-  ,  Currently ,  both estate and property taxes are calculated based on lands highest and best-use value ,  which usually involves development 


-  Estate tax reform would allow heirs to defer or avoid applicable estate taxes on inherited land in return for managing their land in ways that benefit endangered species 


-  The agreement could be revocable ,  and the estate taxes would become due when heirs have stopped managing the land as agreed on 


-  For example ,   bill before the 104th  


-  Congress proposed easing inheritance taxes to give landowners incentives to create and maintain wildlife habitats 


- 52 Estate tax reform could also allow the estate  ( or heirs )  to make tax-deductible gifts of land or an interest in land to  qualified organization 


-  ,  Property tax reform could create credits for the cost of land management programs that benefit endangered species on private lands 


-  In  move that has gained the support of both property-rights advocates and environmentalists ,  the Texas legislature recently approved proposition 11 ,   law that allows owners of agricultural land to convert it to wildlife management uses without losing valuable property-tax exemptions 


- 53 Or an income tax deduction could allow for the costs of land improvement to enhance its value as an endangered species habitat 


-  ,  Tax law could also establish  program of tradable permits in endangered species protection 


-  Any landowner wishing to decrease the conservation value of his or her land would do so by offsetting this decrease with credits gained by arranging an equivalent increase elsewhere or by purchasing those credits from another landowner 


-  ,  Two impediments to reestablishing endangered species are  (  )  building adequate local support and  (  )  providing enough funding for management of  particular species 


-  Authorizing  species-specific trust fund with nonfederal cost-sharing requirements could relieve these impediments 


-  Individual and corporate donors could contribute to the protection of particular species ,  as Exxon Corporation has worked with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to establish the international Save the Tiger fund 


-  This technique engages private-sector and local interests in recovery of endangered species while also stimulating the local economy associated with species recovery 


-  All nonprofit organizations and government agencies would be eligible for ecosystem management grants on  matching basis 


-  Such  program would motivate competitive forces and provide flexible funding arrangements 


-  ,  In the few situations in which all or most of the development of  property is precluded because of the needs of an endangered species ,   program could be devised to trade federal lands with low biological diversity value for private land with high biological diversity value ,  thereby shifting some ESA costs back to the government and reducing the burden on private landowners 


-   recently proposed swap involved $380 million in federally owned oil and gas fields and timberland in exchange for thousands of acres of old growth in the Headwaters Forest in California ,  currently owned by Maxxam Inc 


-  Through such trades ,  the Department of the Interior can use its surplus land portfolio ,  including oil and gas subsurface leases ,  as assets in exchange for private-sector lands 


-  By targeting economically valuable federal lands that lack biological diversity ,  the department can sell them to the highest bidder and use the money to benefit endangered species 


-  ,   test of this concept is underway in the Umpqua River Basin ,  which extends from the crest of the Cascade Mountains to the Pacific Ocean 


-  The team will then determine the feasibility of land exchanges between private owners and the government landowners in the area  ( such as the Bureau of Land Management ,  the Forest Service ,  and the state and local counties )  to protect vital areas 


-  Extending this to lands that the other federal agencies manage could bring the total to $11 billion 


- 55 These fees could offset the tax burden for operating expenses and link users and land managers to ensure that managers provide the resources that users most want 


-  ,  Current proposals call for takings legislation to offset the loss of private land value 


-  ( Unlike the terms connotation as harmful to endangered species ,  takings refers to government control of private land 


-  )  We are concerned that providing  subsidy for takings would promote opportunism and excessive costs to state and federal treasuries 


-  Second ,  there are tremendous opportunities for speculation 


-  If  parcel of land is  known habitat for an endangered species ,   developer could obtain the property with the intention of extorting rewards at the expense of the federal or state government 


-  Third ,  takings can often assign property rights to the wrong individual 


-  If clear-cutting is the stated right of the logging industry ,  should loggers be compensated for not creating runoff that damages the downstream salmon fishery? If  developer chooses to fill in  wetland ,  should it be compensated for not destroying fish-breeding grounds ,  natural water-filtering capacity ,  or the ability of the river to absorb rising floodwaters? ,  Each complication affects sport fishermen and downstream municipal water plants and communities 


-  Which party should be assigned the property right of  balanced ecosystem? How can the social costs of habitat destruction be included in development economic formulas? Takings legislation resolves neither issue ,  while market incentives offer an efficient solution to both 


-  To cut funding would undermine their efforts ,  creating costly uncertainty ,  delaying corporate expenditures already allocated ,  and ultimately increasing overall costs 


-  ,  At the same time ,  we know that information on species needs ,  development impacts ,  and the most cost-effective protection methods will change over time 


-  If new information suggests that protection needs to be altered significantly and imposes increased costs ,  the public should share or largely underwrite the burden of that change 


-  ,  Another way to reduce landowners uncertainty is to streamline ESA review procedures where possible 


-  ,  But the primary ways of ensuring more certainty are to  (  )  generate more information about species needs and ecosystems ,  (  )  encourage collaborative problem solving by all participants considering all available information ,  and  (  )  provide adequate resources for local ,  regional and federal implementation 


-  These critical points correct market inefficiencies and involve the business community in species protection 


-  ,  Developing ecosystem management requires adequate funding and resources for generating the scientific and economic information essential to wise investment decisions 


-  And ,  in resolving ESA disputes ,  high-quality information is needed to resolve conflicts 


-  Gap analysis represents state-of-the-art inventory and landscape mapping to identify areas needing protection 


-  The public will be able to learn about identified areas through interactive geographic information systems  ( although it might be necessary to withhold the identity of some parcels to discourage opportunistic collecting of endangered species )  


-  million for the FWSs endangered species program ,  of which only 20 percent was for consulting 


-  On  relative basis ,  this amount is out of proportion with the increased activities that the service is undertaking 


-  Formal project opinions grew by 280 percent ,  and species listings increased by 37 percent  ( see Figure  )  


-  By most accounts ,  The endangered species program is severely short of money and overwhelmed by  backlog of hundreds of imperiled species  and by almost as many lawsuits demanding action to save them 


- 58 ,  It is economically irresponsible to create an endangered species protection program and then starve it of needed resources 


-  An impoverished program is likely to lead to delays ,  uncertainties ,  and impasses ,  which create uncertainty for business ,  which ,  in turn ,  cause more delays and cost overruns 


-  ,  Generated information must incorporate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders 


-  Science-based assessment of alternative conservation strategies is critical ,  but it is also important for affected interests to participate in recovery planning 


-  Advisory boards of affected and interested groups can identify ways to minimize local impact and future impasses 


-  ,  The current process for granting federal protection to species requires no formal involvement of affected groups beyond an opportunity for public comment in the rule-making process 


-  On one level ,  it seems appropriate to limit consideration of  species status to scientific input and assessment 


-  ,  Through HCPs ,  public and private parties can interact and devise plans that are sensitive to local economies while protecting endangered species 


-  ,  Ultimately ,  an overarching federal mandate can help ensure that interested parties negotiate 


-  Multiparty negotiation can function in an incentive structure that encourages parties to bargain in good faith and seek creative solutions 


-  In the many negotiations already conducted under the ESA ,  it is clear that the absolute mandate to protect species helped motivate various public and private interests to simultaneously protect environmental and economic concerns 


-  ,  In many ways ,  this approach parallels that of other market-based mechanisms to pollution control ,  in which government standards set binding objectives but affected interests determine how to reach those standards 


-  Having clear performance measures and flexibility will yield the most efficient ,  effective strategies for achieving economic and environmental objectives simultaneously 


-  ,   new type of resource management ,  called ecosystem management ,  incorporates many themes  science-based decision making ,  stakeholder involvement ,  articulation of social values ,  and long-term planning 


-  Ecosystem management attempts to shift from  single-minded focus on individual species to  broad-based focus on regional resource management 


-  Endangered species management is useful as an indicator of ecosystems in crisis ,  but the ultimate objective is  stable ecosystem 


-  Hence it is necessary to protect species as components of ecosystems and as  proxies for ecosystem integrity 


-  ,  Early research on ecosystem-based approaches to resource management suggests that they may be appropriate for the future 


- 61 They are regional in scale ,  emphasize collaborative decision making by  full range of public and private interests ,  and seek to balance economic and environmental concerns 


-  Their ability to focus public and private resources on shared problems and work through conflicts that have often led to impasse can yield substantial efficiencies for all parties 


-  ,  One way to move toward an ecosystem-based approach might be to delegate aspects of ESA implementation to state and local officials 


- 62 Many states already have sensitive-species programs underway that might result in program efficiencies and more sensitive ,  local decision making 


-  But other parties ,  including nongovernmental organizations ,  can play  role in consortia to protect valuable ecosystems 


-  These consortia must have the capacity ,  motivation ,  and authority to implement endangered species programs 


-  For example ,  the current ESA state-grants program could promote the regional consortias ecosystem-level action with  provision to delegate program authority 


-  Providing ways for citizens to sue guarantees that such innovative approaches are monitored for effective implementation 


-  ,  Ecosystem-based approaches to species management ,  underway in many places ,  are likely to represent the future of natural resource management in the United States 


- 63 For example ,  the Georgia Conservancy has proposed  statewide watershed protection project centered on clusters of community-based groups in fifteen major watersheds in Georgia ,  while the Conservation Fund has formed  voluntary land-protection program along Georgias Ebenezer Creek 


-  In Maine ,  three large paper companies  Baskahegan ,  Champion International ,  and Georgia Pacific  have banded together to form the Salmon Habitat and River Enhancement Project  ( SHARE )  to protect the habitat of the Atlantic salmon 


-  And landowners in southwest Florida are joining to voluntarily protect more than  million acres that make up the habitat for the endangered Florida panther 


-  These kinds of locally based ,  public-private partnerships will move resource management debates from  reactive ,  crisis mode to  more proactive ,  deliberative community approach 


-  ,  When first written ,  the ESA was intended as  policy of last resort ,  in which species deserving intensive care received protection 


-  But our understanding of resource management ,  policy implementation ,  and the interrelationship between the economy and the environment have evolved considerably 


-  Ultimately ,  the goal of endangered species protection represents the goal of the entire framework 


-  Rather than pursuing environmental goals based on the fluctuations of best available technology or most practicable economic calculations ,  endangered species protection has the goal of maintaining valuable ,  productive ecosystems 


-  By developing management plans that are guided by the objective of balancing local ,  regional ,  and state economies with the health of the ecosystem on which they are based ,  the ESA seeks the end-point of all environmental objectives: economic and environmental sustainability 


-  ,  Species protection is not only for ourselves but for future generations 


-  As stewards ,  we can enhance the benefits of our actions ,  minimize the costs ,  limit the hidden externalities ,  maintain our natural capital ,  and avoid the precipitative effects of boom-and-bust economic transitions only if we promote improvements in the ESA process 


-  One way to be more proactive is to move toward ecosystem-scale management that includes human populations while still providing  safety net for the most endangered organisms 


-  By including the human population ,  the ESA process must become more inclusive and negotiations more creative 


-  By taking  broad look at all aspects of this process  economic ,  environmental ,  and political  cooperative ecosystem management is the best way to foster joint gains in environmental protection and economic growth over the long term
