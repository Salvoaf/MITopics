-  Where should we turn for guidance in developing these skills? Which are the benchmarks ,  the best-practice leaders in the knowledge business ,  the firms whose source of competitive advantage resides in their capacity to tap the collective intelligence of members and to work together to create value for customers? ,  Those firms ,  we argue here ,  are professional service firms  ( PSFs )  they are lawyers ,  accountants ,  doctors ,  consultants ,  and investment bankers 


-  ,  The recruiting processes at the three PSFs were distinguished by the clear ,  specific criteria they used to identify candidates that they considered the best 


-  The firms thought entrepreneurial instincts were manifested in an inquisitive ,  energetic mind that saw and recognized opportunity ,  skills likely to translate that opportunity into new business and the motivation to do so 


-  The sense of self-expectation is colossal 


-  ,  Thus the selection process began with clear criteria that focused on qualities designed to make collaboration work in the long term: capable ,  trustworthy colleagues ,  with high potential for personal growth ,  who were oriented toward working together and committed to thinking ,  at an organizationwide level ,  about the firms business 


-  ,   commitment to ,  and  willingness to invest in ,  developing each professional throughout his or her career was  core value of each firm 


-  One founding partner in the law firm remarked: ,  Ive always viewed the objective of the firm as identifying what is the highest and best use of the people that you have 


-  We need to think about how we support each other ,  how we build something that is greater than the sum of the pieces 


-  ,  This willingness to invest was ,  in turn ,  based on beliefs about the reciprocal commitment of the individual to the firm and the benefits to the firm as  result 


-  Two investment banking partners echoed similar views: ,  People really do try to invest in each other ,  because theres  significant understanding here that your success is very much  function of the entire firm 


-  ,  Three particular aspects of the professional development processes at the PSFs stood out:  (  )  an apprenticeship approach that relied heavily on senior partners as models with  willingness to invest time to work closely with younger staff ,  (  )   belief that learning does not stop with promotion to partnership ,  and  (  )  continuous feedback 


-  ,  Senior partners willingness to personally invest in the growth of new hires was always present 


-  Senior managements willingness to retire partners who are not contributing at the level they once did is  very important ingredient in adding to the enthusiasm and incentive of the younger people 


-  Everyone here is evaluated by people senior to them ,  junior to them ,  and their peers ,  one investment banking partner explained ,  and partners have the same kind of evaluation process 


-   senior physician described its purpose: It doesnt go into your file or into your compensation; its just  tool for learning ,  for asking How am  doing as  provider of caring service? ,  Throughout development ,  firm members believed they were both learners and teachers: according to one law partner ,  top performers and role models were elevated to  platform ,  not  pedestal ,  where others could join because everyone was expected to help elevate each others performance 


-  The commitment that developed during apprenticeship became  strong factor in the firms ability to retain high performers 


-  ,  An obvious observation that we might make is the deep sense of engagement that each individual had with the firm 


-  ,  Loyalty developed from the firms developmental focus but was also due to  sense of stewardship   belief in and commitment to something that each partner saw as meaningful beyond his or her own interests  that encompassed clients ,  colleagues ,  and the firm itself 


-  ,  The sense of stewardship both built on and provided shared beliefs 


-  He said we want to contribute to the community 


-  These values created  sense of unity and coherence that simplified the complexities inherent in working within the firms often complicated organizational structures 


-  That doesnt mean that everybody agrees with everything ,  but it means there is sufficient understanding and dialogue so people see the broader picture 


-  ,  At each firm ,  respect for others opinions was key 


-  An investment banker remarked: ,  Its very ,  very important that people here respect each others opinion and consider it ,  and that they work toward consensus and things dont get polarized 


-  Even when  majority of the executive committee feels strongly about  subject ,  if theres  minority position thats not irrational and has  strong base of intellectual support ,  thats usually the opinion that sways ,  even at the risk of losing the competitive advantage of moving very quickly 


-  ,  Reward systems ,  which partners saw as equitable and supportive of collaboration ,  were also key to the high levels of engagement and retention of top performers: ,  Everything from an accounting standpoint would be double or triple counted ,  so that all people would get full credit 


-  ,  For partners ,  shared values ,  sense of enjoyment ,  stewardship ,  equitable reward system ,  and inclusive decision processes together created significant barriers to exit 


-  The firms carefully developed within individual professionals the technical expertise ,  team consciousness ,  institutionwide focus ,  and deep sense of engagement with the firm and its clients through mentoring ,   voice in governance ,  an equitable reward system ,  and shared values 


-  ,  The PSFs in our study ,  we hypothesize ,  distinguish themselves from their counterparts when they help clients deal with complex situations that cross the traditional boundaries of technical expertise 


-   law partner offered an illustration: ,  Last week we were contacted by an investor in the United Kingdom who wanted to acquire distress claims against an entity in both Europe and the United States 


-  We identified issues running from pure litigation strategy ,  to bankruptcy considerations ,  to civil and criminal forfeiture law ,  tax law ,  and corporate securities 


-  ,  The capacity to work together rested on an individual willingness to learn and  belief that no one had all the answers 


-  Many researchers have argued that shared problem solving leads to greater creativity 


-  ,  Enjoyment in the work itself that we spoke of earlier also seemed to contribute to members willingness to engage in creative conversation 


-  Advisers are trusted people 


-  We want to become advisers to our clients 


-  So every client has someone ,  usually  group ,  but certainly one person who is charged with managing that relationship and knows everything about the client and its needs ,  objectives ,  and idiosyncrasies 


-  ,   firms ability to enhance its capability to deliver these kinds of solutions depends on clients willingness to bring it problems for which either current solutions are inadequate or no solution exists 


-  ,  The collaborative capacity for boundary crossing is more difficult for competitors to replicate than individually-based expertise and ,  hence ,  is considerably more valuable not only to customers but also to the firm itself in sustaining advantage 


- 13 The politics of their coalitions ,  their fragmented viewpoints ,  and the inability of their consensus-based decision-making processes to produce meaningful change with alacrity have been amply documented 


-  The capacity for collaboration relies on mutual respect ,  openness ,  and trust; on an ability and desire to maintain an open dialogue; on shared goals and an interest in  common stewardship; and on systems that foster and reward teamwork 


-  The capacity for learning relies on different contextual factors   willingness to be self-critical ,   belief that one doesnt have all the answers ,  and  commitment to lifelong development 


-  Taken together ,  these qualities create an institutional capacity for flexibility and responsiveness that greatly enhances the firms ability to have  sense of their future ,  to be patient in searching for consensus ,  and to reengineer themselves as necessary to adapt to changing circumstances 


-  In fact ,  it sees the two as inseparable in that increased capabilities at the organizational level flow from development at the individual level 


-  ,  In thinking about what we might learn from our visits to the PSFs ,  we used the community-of-practice metaphor to understand why generating  how to list for other organizations is so difficult 


-  They exist in the minds of their members ,  in the sense of connection that they have with each other and with the larger institution 


-  They act as if they really care about their members development by selecting them carefully ,  investing in their ongoing learning ,  rewarding them appropriately ,  offering them  voice in firm governance ,  and ,  in general ,  giving them good reasons not to leave 


-  ,  This should be simple ,  except that firms have gotten it so wrong for so long by hiring people without concern for their long-term fit with the businesss principles ,  by treating them as commodities ,  by denying them  voice in decisions that affect them ,  and by giving them reason to leave for more lucrative offers 


-  Such  process begins ,  we believe ,  with value-driven leaders willing to fundamentally reexamine organizational capabilities ,  values ,  and practices and ask ,  What kind of firm are we committed to being? ,  The PSFs traditional areas of weakness  narrow specialists who see only their own solutions ,  self-centered egoists unwilling or unable to collaborate with colleagues ,  fragmented perspectives and interest group politics that stymie institutional change  are the areas in which the firms studied have found their sources of sustainable advantage 


-  The people in the firms have the self-confidence and independence that such demanding professional work with clients demands ,  yet they remain willing to acknowledge their need to learn from and rely on each other 


-  All organizations ,  we believe ,  have much to learn from these extraordinary institutions
