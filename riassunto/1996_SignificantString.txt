- Change has become the trademark of the business world in the 1990s 


-  The pace of change is so frenetic that organizational theorists view change management as  critical competency  in some cases ,  the critical competency  for successful organizations in the future 


-  New customer demands and technological capabilities are causing organizations to undergo transformations that involve redefining their very mission 


-  Not surprisingly ,  subunits within those organizations ,  particularly the information technology  ( IT )  function ,  are also rethinking their roles 


-  The growing importance of information ,  coupled with the increased distribution of the technology to knowledgeable users ,  has both IT professionals and business managers reexamining the role of the IT unit 


-  This article presents our perspective on the future of the IT organization ,  based on three years of research on ITs changing role 


-  ,  Our conclusions are partially drawn from  study of new IT management practices in fifty firms and  comparative study of IT organizations in four countries 


-  As part of the latter project ,  we interviewed IS executives at four large  


-  Their views on the future of IT organizations in general and ,  more particularly ,  their plans and change programs for their organizations ,  form the basis for our thinking 


-  These CIOs and other IS managers with whom we have discussed the future role of IT offered diverse views of their environments 


-  Most had unique plans for their particular units ,  but many common themes emerged 


-  ,  We review these themes first by exploring changes in business and technology that are driving changes in the role and structure of IT units 


-  We then define and discuss eight imperatives for IT organizations in responding to these changes 


-  Finally ,  we suggest the responsibilities that will become core activities of the IT unit and emphasize  major factor necessary to its future success: line managements assumption of  joint leadership role for IT 


-  ,  Not surprisingly ,  the CIOs we interviewed said their firms were experiencing an increasingly volatile business environment ,  driven by greatly intensified global competition ,  which has major implications for firms 


-  There is less slack time ,  both in developing new products and in delivering customer orders 


-  Customer satisfaction no longer means just prompt ,  courteous service; it also means designing products and services to meet individual customer needs 


-  Equally important ,  costs must continuously go down ,  not up 


-  Finally ,  firms increasingly must give multinational customers  consistent product and simplified order and payment processes across their dispersed divisions 


-  ,  The global competitive environment has ,  in turn ,  led to four major changes in how organizations operate and are managed 


-  All involve major process change 


-  All heavily involve IT 


-  ,  This increasingly understood need to have both the advantages of global resource management and responsiveness to local market conditions has led organizations to rethink more than just the horizontal  ( across the value chain )  systems 


-  It has also encouraged them to rethink their vertical processes  that is ,  their key managerial processes such as the planning process ,  the quality process ,  the sales managerial process ,  and so on 


-  Managerial processes ,  which ,  with the exception of financial management ,  were rarely designed at all in the past ,  can now ,  with IT ,  be designed to deliver appropriate operational ,  customer ,  and competitive information 


-  Companies like Frito-Lay ,  Miller Brewing ,  and Xerox have redesigned many managerial processes specifically to deliver information lower in the hierarchy to teams closer to the customers ,  where decisions can be made with the latest detailed information 


-  We call this managerial process redesign  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,   fourth type of process redesign underway involves  firms external customers and suppliers  ( see Figure  )  


-  With the advent of more cost-effective communications technology ,  there is also  need to emphasize the design of improved approaches to what Forrester Research terms the customer connection 


-  This also often extends in the reverse direction to supply chain integration ,  as illustrated by the Efficient Consumer Response initiative in the  


-  ,  Redesigning processes to serve customers is not new; it has been more than  decade since Federal Express added information to its service 


-  In the 1980s ,  many organizations provided increased customer contact by giving customers access to their order-entry systems ,  and some ,  like Baxter Healthcare ,  went further by taking over related services at their clients 


-  But the magnitude of such opportunities offered by cheaper ,  broadband communications is now more apparent 


-  United Airlines is moving to  ticketless approach for serving customers 


-  State Street Bank has placed information formerly held in its mainframe files at customer premises in client/server form to facilitate improved ,  simpler analysis by customer personnel 


-  But the tide of customer-oriented process change is just beginning to swell 


-  The opportunities and perils presented by the Internet and various private networks for companies with established brand names  ( banks ,  insurance companies ,  pharmaceuticals ,  and so on )  are increasingly evident 


-  In the last half of this decade ,  we will see major attention to such customer-oriented redesign initiatives 


-  ,  Equally ,  the movements of quick response and efficient consumer response have seized on the technologies of electronic data interchange  ( EDI )  ,  shared databases ,  and collaborative systems to take time ,  inventory ,  and quality slack out of the supply chain 


-  Wal-Marts integration with Procter  Gamble in the United States ,  7-Elevens fast replenishment system in Japan ,  and Marks  Spencers contract management system in the United Kingdom are examples 


-  We call this integration of processes with customers and suppliers  ( plus allies )  network process redesign 


-  ,  These four major efforts at process redesign are having  major impact on IT organizations 


-  Although pressure for the business changes started in the manufacturing sector ,  the needs to reduce costs and increase services have spread to all sectors  ( including service ,  health ,  and education )  ,  and all IT organizations are affected 


-  On the one hand ,  information technology enables most effective process change ,  so the load on IT organizations is becoming much heavier 


-  On the other hand ,  IT units must reduce costs ,  raise quality ,  reduce lead times ,  and improve customer service 


-  The challenge for IT units is thus to do more with fewer resources 


-  ,  The technology environment has undergone  complete change in the past few years 


-  New development methodologies ,  integrated package suites ,  and exploding technologies create  situation in which IT units must interface with as many as 50 to 100 suppliers  ( not the previous  to 10 major ones )  to meet their needs 


-  The key technological issues are: ,  What do all these business and technological changes mean for the IT organization? The oft-cited metaphor of changing an airplane engine in mid-flight comes readily to mind 


-  The business changes alone are daunting 


-  However ,  major changes in systems development ,  in hardware and software ,  and in the rapidly changing ,  vastly increasing options for both computing and communications make the technology issues particularly challenging 


-  These challenges are often coupled ,  however ,  with inadequate technical and business training in IT units and are compounded by IT spending patterns that disperse IT investment planning throughout firms 


-  In sum ,  the load on IT organizations is heavier than ever before ,  and the management of IT is more complex 


-  ,  Given this environment ,  we see eight imperatives for the IT organizations of the late 1990s 


-  To be truly successful ,  an IT organization must excel in each  ( see Table  )  


-  ,  The first imperative is to align IT strategy with the organizations business strategy 


-  With more than 50 percent of capital equipment investment in the United States now being devoted to information technology ,  IT has clearly become  major resource for management in carrying out its strategic initiatives 


-  To ensure that investments in IT are targeted at strategic priorities ,  IT management must be knowledgeable about senior managements strategic and tactical thinking 


-  The CIO must become either  formal or informal member of the top management team ,  and other senior IT executives must become members of key task forces 


-  IT people must be present when business strategies are debated 


-  As firms consider their future in an information era of superhighways ,  multimedia ,  and information richness ,  IT executives should contribute more positively to management thinking by identifying the business threats and opportunities that IT poses 


-  It is evident that technology influences strategy as well as vice versa 


-  They also emphasize senior line managements ability to understand opportunities available through IT 


-  Formal and informal senior management education about IT is underway in many firms that are conducting technology and strategy workshops 


-  Leading-edge organizations have revived IT steering committees that are very different from those of the 1970s and 1980s ,  when each member argued vociferously for funding for his or her particular function or suborganization 


-  Todays committees are formally charged with two primary objectives:  (  )  to ensure that appropriate education is provided for ,  and absorbed by ,  all members to enable them to make effective business decisions about information technology; and  (  )  to require members to take an organizationwide perspective in decisions on IT resources 


-  These new committees reflect the need to support the processes noted in Figure  and the increased importance of allocating scarce IT resources effectively 


-  ,  The key people using information technology in any organization are its functional ,  product ,  and geographical line managers 


-  Thus IT personnel at all levels must develop strong ,  on-going partnerships with line managers 


-  Only through these relationships can the necessary communication occur to ensure that both business and technology capabilities are integrated into effective solutions for each level of the business 


-  In an effective relationship ,  IT professionals and line managers work together to understand business opportunities ,  determine needed functionality ,  choose among technology options ,  and decide when urgent business needs demand sacrificing technical excellence for immediate ,  albeit incomplete ,  solutions 


-  Beath ,  Goodhue ,  and Ross note that effective IT-business relationships are one of the three major resources  ( along with IT human resources and the technology infrastructure )  that IT executives must manage well in order to deliver value to  firm 


-  These relationships demand that both IT and line managers accept accountability for systems projects ,  which is achievable only when both parties share their unique expertise 


-  Many IT executives are assigning high-level account managers ,  chosen for their knowledge of the business and technical capability ,  to focus specifically on IT-business communication and understanding 


-  ,  In an article on CIO effectiveness ,  Earl and Feeny identified the IT-business relationship as critical to an IT organizations ability to add value to the business 


-  They observed that building the IT-business relationship overlaps with six other factors to enable  CIO to provide business value 


-  We have adapted Earl and Feenys framework by concentrating on the relationship variable and three others: focusing on business imperatives ,  concentrating development efforts on strategically important initiatives ,  and establishing  credible IS performance track record 


-  We have added another variable ,  increased business knowledge  ( see Figure  )  ,  which often underpins the efforts by some companies ,  such as British Petroleum ,  to turn systems professionals into business consultants 


-  ,  These five strategies combine in  feedback loop that leads to ongoing IT success 


-  IT managers utilize in-depth business knowledge to build strong executive relationships ,  which allow them to focus on business imperatives and then concentrate IT development efforts on those imperatives 


-  Successful systems built for priorities then enhance ITs track record ,  which ,  in turn ,  improves business relationships at all levels 


-  Successful systems and improved relationships in turn add to greater business knowledge ,  and the cycle continues to build 


-  Earl and Feenys targeting of relationships as  critical imperative for IT management is certainly appropriate 


-  ,  Although the primary function of the IT department has been the development and operation of systems ,  todays approach to system development is radically different from the past 


-  The task has changed from developing mainframe-based transaction-processing systems that support  single function to delivering desktop systems that address the integrated data needs of knowledge workers supporting redesigned processes 


-  The environment has also changed ,  as internal clients have lost patience with long development times ,  inflexible interfaces ,  and cost overruns 


-  Some have introduced time-box approaches ,  which require the delivery of usable system components at regular intervals 


-  Time boxes force developers and their business partners to focus on functionality ,  thus avoiding overengineered solutions and unnecessary delays 


-  Another way to avoid delays and target critical functionality ,  as noted above ,  is to recognize that high-level line managers must be the ultimate project leaders ,  thus ensuring that the business people who will use the system take responsibility for its implementation 


-  ,  But faster cycle times and the need for data integration and sophisticated interfaces have led to more revolutionary changes as well ,  particularly in the extent to which firms rely on outside sources 


-  For example ,  more IT units enlist the help of contractors ,  especially in areas where their tools and technologies are needed; two prime examples are client/server systems and Internet applications 


-  Some subcontract all specialist application development to niche third parties 


-  ,  CASE-based tools that they customize to meet their specific needs 


-  ,  Firms are increasingly recognizing that they do not have the time ,  money ,  expertise ,  or inclination to develop large integrated systems in-house and are relying on integrated packages 


-  As noted earlier ,  they are purchasing software from firms like SSA ,  SAP ,  Baan ,  and others to address their needs for integrated systems 


-  More importantly ,  because packages inevitably require changes in business processes ,  IT must work even more closely with functional managers who are responsible for making the systems work in practice 


-  ,  Thus systems delivery often involves procurement and requires the experience and skills of an informed buyer 


-  Purchased software provides  solution for organizational processes that offer no particular competitive advantage  ( or where competitive advantage accrues ,  it does from use ,  not ownership )  


-  However ,  firms are still identifying applications that offer unique competitive features ,  in particular ,  those that improve customer connections ,  and thus they are still developing software internally 


-  ,  In sum ,  systems delivery now includes not only systems development but also procurement and integration 


-  The total systems delivery load in most firms has increased greatly and shows no signs of slowing down ,  mostly because of the business and technology changes we have identified 


-  ,  IT is currently charged with creating an IT infrastructure of telecommunications ,  computers ,  software ,  and data that is integrated and interconnected so that all types of information can be expeditiously  and effortlessly ,  from the users viewpoint  routed through the network and redesigned processes 


-  Because it involves fewer manual or complex computer-based interventions ,   seamless infrastructure is cheaper to operate than independent ,  divisional infrastructures 


-  In addition ,  an effective infrastructure is  prerequisite for doing business globally ,  where the sharing of information and knowledge throughout the organization is increasingly vital 


-  ,  IT units must address four challenges in developing and supporting their firms IT infrastructure 


-  While hardware and software capabilities are obviously part of that architecture ,  the treatment of data  ( what is to be standardized ,  where it is to be located ,  and so on )  and the treatment of applications  in particular ,  decisions on the embedding of applications into the infrastructure itself  (  


-  Interestingly ,  some European companies in our study included the information processing skills required of users in their conceptualization of infrastructure 


-  ,  Second ,  IT units must establish technology standards for implementing the architecture 


-  This requires constant screening and testing to determine which technologies meet organizational needs for integration and support 


-  The rapid pace of change in information technologies means that IT units must develop the ability to establish ,  support ,  reevaluate ,  and ,  as appropriate ,  change technology standards 


-  What is extremely clear is  movement toward increased emphasis on standards for improved cost and effectiveness 


-  The time ,  energy ,  and expertise needed for making appropriate selections is slowly driving every major company to have  headquarters group ,  often in conjunction with  committee of IT personnel from local organizations ,  select  small set of corporate standards 


-  In most decentralized ,  federal organizations ,  local management is taxed for infrastructure support ,  so it becomes important that the value of the infrastructure is as apparent as the cost 


-  The value of any infrastructure ,  however ,  depends on managements strategic vision for its use 


-  Consequently ,  the infrastructure design and the money invested in it ,  and the infrastructure services that IT provides ,  have become senior management business decisions 


-  ,  Finally ,  IT units must operate an increasingly complex infrastructure 


-  The user with  problem cares not at all about whether the error is located in telecommunications ,  mainframes ,  servers ,  routers ,   database ,  or the application itself 


-  He or she needs help 


-  While there are currently no capabilities to look seamlessly through all aspects of the network ,  the responsibility for building and operating  full network will increasingly become the role of  new super operations manager   chief network officer  ( CNO )  


-  Reporting to the CIO ,  this person will have end-to-end responsibility for one of the organizations critical assets 


-  ,  For almost two decades ,  the basic approach to systems development did not change 


-  Developers in this environment must regularly learn new programming languages ,  operating systems ,  and communications protocols 


-  And network operators find systems and network management to be particularly challenging as they migrate from hierarchical network environments to peer-to-peer networks 


-  These changes have resulted in large gaps in the IT staffs technical skills 


-  ,  Equally important ,  as IT becomes ubiquitous in all organizations and  critical element of new business strategies and tactics ,  most IT leaders have found that their staff people are woefully lacking in business knowledge and skills 


-  If the necessary relationships are to be built  ( as noted in Imperative  )  ,  IT reskilling must go beyond technology skills to business skills 


-  There are estimates that up to 50 percent of existing IT personnel will not be able to make the technical transition ,  much less be able to learn the appropriate business skills 


-  Whatever the approach ,  reskilling is underway in all IT organizations ,  at  very significant cost 


-  ,  Outsourcing some IT responsibilities to computing services firms can compensate for skill shortages in IT units and relieve management of the need to oversee tasks that are not competitive strengths or core competencies 


-  As  result of their economies of scale ,  many vendors in principle can provide more reliable ,  cost-effective support than in-house units ,  while allowing top IT management to focus on strategic priorities 


- 10 IT managers must be at least as skilled as the outsourcer in each area ,  be informed buyers and prime negotiators ,  and derive satisfaction from seeing  job done well not just from doing it 


- 11 Vendors and customers have suffered from confusion on this point 


-  ,  In the 1990s ,  IT units ,  like all other functions in the firm ,  must strive to meet increasingly demanding performance goals and improve their economic and operational track record 


-  In Figure  ,  we showed the importance of an IT track record in relationships with business management 


-  ,  Affordability and cost efficiency have become vital issues as IT budgets continue to rise ,  especially when companies discover that more than 50 percent of expenditures is with the end user 


-  Outsourcing and downsizing are two responses to this challenge 


-  Companies are also installing new cost metrics to promote IT cost-consciousness ,  such as IT cost per unit of product or service ,  activity-based costing of IT services ,  and distribution cost analysis of IT-intensive operations 


-  Companies have transferred TQM and customer service programs into the IT unit 


-  For example ,  Motorola has introduced six-sigma performance goals in an IT quality program 


-  Information-intensive service businesses are using customer surveys ,  simulated customer queries ,  and customer complaint analysis 


-  ,  Finally ,  in manufacturing terminology again ,  time to market has become  primary issue 


-  Systems can no longer constrain business development 


-   wait of two or more years for application development is unacceptable when markets are changing so fast 


-  As mentioned earlier ,  new systems development methods ,  greater use of packages ,  and time-box projects are some approaches to shorten development time 


-  Other approaches include prototyping ,  80/20 requirements definitions ,  targeted deployment of enduser software tools ,  and Internet technologies 


-  ,  These dimensions of IT performance not only affect the credibility of the IT unit but also show that IT is no different from other organizational units 


-  IT must also perform effectively to enable the total competitiveness of any business 


-  ,  For the past three decades ,  IT organizations have struggled with the centralization-decentralization issue 


-  The exact locus of all or part of IT decision-making power is critical ,  and getting the right distribution of managerial responsibilities is ,  thus ,  the eighth imperative 


-  ,  Our research suggests that ,  increasingly ,  these responsibilities are distributed to both local organizations and the central IT unit ,  as Handy described 


- 12 Handy designated  federal organization that follows the political model of the division of power between  central authority and local governments  (  


-  His model allows for significant autonomy at the local level in business organizations but also the scale necessary for organizationwide planning ,  resource allocation ,  centralized purchasing ,  and other benefits 


-  ,  Hodgkinson ,  in applying this theory to the IT organization ,  noted that both decentralized IT and centralized IT have real disadvantages  ( see Figure  )  


- 13 Both ,  however ,  provide many advantages  ( see the central ellipse in the figure )  


-  Decentralization of some decisions fosters user control over IT priorities and business unit ownership of their systems ,  for example 


-  These ,  in turn ,  enable the benefits of both centralization and decentralization and allow strategic control and synergy throughout the organization 


-  Once  federal structure is in place ,  though ,  it can be easily modified as the requirements of the host organization change and technological learning evolves 


-  However ,  single-line businesses are now also discovering the advantages of federalism 


-  The model here is devolution of systems analysis and consultancy activities to departments ,  functions ,  or processes ,  and  unifying central responsibility for strategy and operations 


-  In other words ,  federal structures help achieve alignment with the business ,  together with economy of scale and architectural integrity 


-  ,  While it is simple to describe the eight imperatives ,  putting everything in place to be effective in each area is much more difficult 


-  What ,  if anything ,  are the current and future roles of the IT organization? ,  No matter how many or how few of the old organizational activities are outsourced ,  the IT organization itself has shifted from being primarily  doing function to  more business-centered ,  advisory ,  and management function 


-  In large organizations ,  IT management will increasingly see its new primary roles as:  (  )  ensuring that line managers at all levels understand ITs potential and how to use the IT resource most effectively in carrying out their strategies; and  (  )  providing advice and expertise to ensure effective implementation of the business strategies and tactics 


-  In other words ,  IT management will work with line management to ensure that the business is doing the right things with information technology 


-  ,  As  result ,  the IT organizations core responsibilities as we move toward the year 2000 will increasingly include understanding and interpreting technology trends; working with line managers to help them develop IT-enhanced strategies; educating and consulting with line management to ensure that the strategic direction is carried out; taking responsibility for ,  or supporting at the very least ,  effective process innovation; developing relationships that permit useful internal partnerships; managing suppliers to whom parts of IT have been outsourced; and developing and managing the IT human resource  ( see central box in Figure  )  


-  The old core IT activities ,  many of which are being subcontracted to the marketplace by outsourcing or joint ventures ,  are the doing activities; they may be retained in-house  ( insourced )  but are managed very much as  commodity  ( see left-hand box in the figure )  


-  User-management responsibilities are both traditional  carrying ultimate responsibility for applications strategy and for systems implementation  and new  personal and local computing ,  and increasingly ,  business-oriented experimentation with new technologies  ( see right-hand box )  ,  Given this division of activities ,  IT management not only is responsible for the new IT core but also has to assist line and user management in managing IT activities 


-  In addition ,  IT management has to ensure that the old tasks are efficiently and effectively carried out ,  either internally or externally 


-  While both these concerns have always been part of the IT mission ,  too few organizations have successfully addressed the need for business-oriented IT personnel capable of building relationships necessary to work effectively with line managers and third parties 


-  ,  The success or failure of an organizations use of IT ,  however ,  is only partially dependent on the effectiveness of the IT organization 


-  It is even more dependent on the capability of line managers at all levels to understand the capabilities of the IT resource and to use it effectively 


-  ,  Information and information technology have become the fifth major resource available to executives for shaping an organization 


-  Companies have managed four major resources for years: people ,  money ,  materials ,  and machines 


-  But ,  today ,  information has become the source of product and process innovation and the wellspring of new businesses 


-  IT is thus  major resource that  unlike single-purpose machines such as lathes ,  typewriters ,  and automobiles  can radically affect an organizations structure ,  the way it serves customers ,  and the way it communicates both internally and externally 


-  ,  Only line managers are close enough to their business segments to see the most effective ways to utilize this resource 


-  Unless IT is included in line managers strategy and tactics ,  and unless line managers can effectively understand and implement  process view of the world ,  the best IT organizations are almost powerless 


-  For the past decade ,  we and others have pointed out that line leadership is an absolute necessity 


- 15 However ,  far too few organizations have delivered the appropriate education and training necessary for line managers to assume this responsibility 


-  ,  In addition to effective planning for the use of the IT resource ,  line managers are also responsible for effective implementation of information technology 


-  Although building good information systems is seldom easy ,  it is far easier than revamping the processes by which people work ,  their roles ,  their reward systems ,  the organizations accounting systems ,  or even the organizations structure or culture  all of which need to be altered to install todays process-based systems 


-  About thirty years ago ,  Harold Leavitt emphasized that an organizations strategy ,  its structure ,  people and their roles ,  and its technology had to remain in balance  ( see Figure  )  


-  If any of the four variables changes ,  Leavitt noted ,  the others must also change to keep the organization balanced 


- 17 ,  With this diagram in mind ,  it becomes painfully obvious that to implement systems successfully ,  line management must be heavily involved 


-  IT management can change only one variable ,  the technology ,  in accord with  strategic or tactical change 


-  The CIO has no power to effect the other necessary changes  ( in the center section of the figure )   the changes in structure ,  culture ,  processes ,  and peoples roles  and therefore no power over the most crucial factors in an implementation process aimed at vastly improving an organizations efficiency and effectiveness 


-  Only line management has the responsibility and power to effectively change these variables 


-  For an organization to successfully use IT today ,  IT management must respond to the changing business and technology environment through effective efforts in each of the eight imperatives 


-  Line management must also shoulder its twin roles of effective planning for the fifth resource and for the implementation of new IT-based processes 


-  ,  The future IT organization must address the dual demands of improving the performance of its services while increasing the impact of those services on the firms bottom line 


-  In most firms ,  the IT unit will become smaller over time but will necessarily possess greater expertise in both technology and business processes 


-  Most important ,  IT resources will be aimed at the organizations strategic needs 


-  ,  The outsourcing of IT tasks seems likely to grow if IT management learns how to handle all the challenges 


-  Then IT executives will focus their time and energies on the highest value-adding responsibilities ,  such as helping top management identify strategic opportunities and developing the blueprint for  solid IT infrastructure 


-  ,  The IT unit of the future ,  even if smaller ,  will be more critical to its firms operations 


-  Effective IT units will help their firms apply IT to redesign processes and access needed information on  tight budget 


-  Those who fail to address the eight imperatives ,  or who are unable to convince line management to undertake its leadership role in both IT-enabled strategy development and systems implementation ,  will be unable to support their organizations in  fast-changing ,  competitive world 


- Few companies around the world have not tried to reinvent themselves  some more than once during the past decade 


-  Yet ,  for every successful corporate transformation ,  there is at least one equally prominent failure 


-  ABBs ascendance to global leadership in power equipment only emphasizes Hitachis inability to reverse its declining fortunes in that business 


-  And Philipss successful revitalization since 1990 only highlights its own agonizingly slow turnaround in the preceding ten years 


-  ,  What accounts for the success of some corporations and the failure of so many others? How did some organizations turn around transformation processes that had clearly stalled? In the course of five years of research into the nature and implications of the radically different organization and management models that have begun to emerge during the past decade ,  we studied more than  dozen companies as they implemented  succession of programs designed to rationalize their inefficient operations ,  revitalize their ineffective strategies ,  and renew their tired organizations 


-  In the process ,  we have gained some insight into the reasons that some made recognizable progress in their transformational change process while others only replaced the dead weight of their bureaucracies with change program overload 


-  ,  In observing how the successful corporate transformation processes have differed from those that struggled or failed outright ,  we were struck by two distinctions 


-  First ,  successful transformation processes almost always followed  carefully phased approach that focused on developing particular organizational capabilities in appropriate sequence 


-  Second ,  the managers of the successful companies recognized that transformation is as much  function of individuals behaviors as it is of the strategies ,  structures ,  and systems that top management introduces 


-  As  result ,  rather than becoming preoccupied with downsizing and reengineering programs ,  they focused much attention on the changes required to fundamentally reshape what we described in our previous article as  companys behavioral context 


-  ,  The problem with most companies that have failed in their transformation efforts is not that they tried to change too little ,  but that they tried to change too much 


-  Faced with the extraordinary demands of their highly competitive ,  rapidly changing operating environments ,  managers have eagerly embraced the flood of prescriptive advice that consultants and academics have offered as solutions  typically in the random sequence of  supply-driven market for management fads 


-  According to  recent survey ,  between 1990 and 1994 ,  the average company had committed itself to 11 


-  of 25 such currently popular management tools and techniques  from corporate visioning and TQM programs to empowerment and re-engineering processes 


-  Despite this widespread frenzy of activity ,  the study found no correlation between the number of tools  company used and its satisfaction with its financial performance 


-  The authors did conclude ,  however ,  that most tools could be helpful if the right ones were chosen at the right time and implemented in the right way 


-  ,  While such  generalization borders on the self-evident ,  we would endorse the importance that the conclusion gives to sequencing and implementing activities in  change process 


-  In many companies ,  we have seen front-line managers bewildered when faced with multiple ,  inconsistent priorities 


-  In contrast ,  we observed that the companies that were most successful in transforming themselves into more flexible ,  responsive organizations pursued  much simpler ,  more focused sequence of actions 


-  By the early 1990s ,  he had begun to create what he called  boundaryless and self-renewing organization 


-  Although he has faulted himself for not moving faster ,  Welch has remained firmly convinced of the logic in the sequence of his actions and of the need to make substantial progress at each stage before moving to the next 


-  It rests on the simple recognition that any companys performance depends on two core capabilities: the strength of each of its component units and the effectiveness of their integration 


-  This is true of the integration of individually strong functional groups along an organizations value chain as well as of the synergistic linking of  companys portfolio of business units or the global networking of its different national subsidiaries 


-  This assumption defines the two axes of the corporate renewal model represented in Figure  


-  ,  As they face the renewal challenge ,  most companies find themselves with  portfolio of operations  ( represented by the circles in Figure  )   few strong but independent units and activities  ( the tightly defined but separate circles in quadrant  )  ,  another cluster of better integrated operations that ,  despite their better integration ,  are not performing well individually  ( the looser ,  overlapping circles in quadrant  )  ,  and  group of business units ,  country subsidiaries ,  or functional entities that dont perform well individually and are also ineffective in linking and leveraging each others resources and capabilities  ( the ill-defined ,  unconnected circles in quadrant  )  


-  ,  The overall objective of the transformation process is to move the entire portfolio into quadrant  and find ways to prevent the units from returning to their old modes of operation 


-  ,  Some companies  General Motors during the 1980s ,  for instance  tried to take the direct route represented by the diagonal path  in the figure 


-  While intellectually and emotionally appealing ,  this bold approach of trying to improve performance on both dimensions simultaneously has typically ended in failure due to the complex ,  often contradictory demands that overload the organization 


-  GM discovered this during the 1980s when it pressured its five auto divisions to boost their individual market share and profitability while simultaneously improving cross-unit synergies 


-  It turned out that the demands of coordinating body styling and chassis design often conflicted with each divisions ability to respond to the needs and opportunities of its own particular market segment 


-  Like GM ,  IBMs attempt in the late 1980s to improve both unit performance and corporate integration also caused that companys transformation program to stumble 


-  ,  Other companies  Philips in the late 1980s ,  for example  followed  more focused path ,  pushing first for integration on the assumption that better synergies among units would help each improve its individual performance 


-  However ,  this change model ,  represented by path  ,  has also proved unsuccessful 


-  In  bold reorganization ,  company president Cor van der Klugt declared Philipss consumer electronics ,  professional electronics ,  components ,  and lighting businesses the companys core interdependent operations and tried to create structures and processes that would help them manage their perceived interdependencies 


-  As the company soon discovered ,  however ,  it was extremely difficult to integrate operations that were themselves struggling with enormous internal difficulties 


-  And even where they succeeded ,  the linkages connecting uncompetitive individual businesses served mostly to emphasize and reinforce the liabilities of each 


-  As corporate performance continued to decline and  new CEO was appointed to try another approach ,  Philips managers concluded ,  with classic gallows humor ,  that four drunks do not make an effective team 


-  It was  lesson that unfortunately was lost on Daimler Benz ,  which continued its efforts to integrate its diverse ,  overstaffed operations until  new top management team signaled  change in direction for the struggling transformation program in 1995 


-  ,  The third option ,  path  in our model ,  defines the most effective sequence of transformational change processes 


-  This is the path Jack Welch followed as he steered GE through an ongoing series of change processes that he initiated in the early 1980s 


-  As we reviewed this much-admired transformation of one of the worlds largest corporations ,  three distinct phases of activity were evident  phases we define as simplification ,  integration ,  and regeneration 


-  In the simplification phase ,  Welch focused on strengthening the performance of each of the companys businesses ,  attempting to make each number one or number two in its industry 


-  During the next five years ,  he sold or closed operations valued at almost $10 billion and acquired new businesses worth $18 billion 


-  He stripped away the heavy superstructure of sectors and groups that had long burdened front-line units and made drastic cuts in the size and responsibilities of corporate staffs 


-  While this streamlining cost the company some ability to integrate and coordinate activities across units ,  Welchs primary concern was to give the managers of the core businesses the freedom to develop new strategies and to control their operations 


-  ,  By the mid-1980s ,  with most of the acquisitions and divestitures completed ,  Welch evolved into  second phase ,  which we call integration 


-  With thirteen businesses running strongly at the companys core ,  he began to look for ways he could link them to exploit potential scale economies ,  leverage their individual resources ,  and capture opportunities for cross-unit learning 


-  Beginning with his top-level corporate executive committee meetings ,  he worked to develop an environment for interunit collaboration that would demonstrate the concrete benefits of cooperation 


-  He urged his senior executives to accept some high-visibility ,  symbolic proposals  putting sixteen pounds of GE plastics into every GE refrigerator ,  for example ,  or having the engineers from the locomotive division resolve  serious design problem in the appliance business 


-  During the next several years ,  he pushed collaboration deeper into the organization through programs designed to open minds ,  clear communications channels ,  and eliminate the parochial attitudes that had insulated functions ,  isolated businesses ,  and separated operating units from each other 


-  ,   decade after he began ,  Welch had simplified GEs organization and integrated its businesses ,  but he realized he had not yet created the kind of organization that he hoped to leave to his successor  one that continually replenished and renewed itself 


-  So he initiated actions that moved GE into the third transformation phase ,  one that would imbue GE with  capability that we call self-regeneration 


-  As he challenges employees with notions of boundarylessness ,  Welch is trying to develop an organization with the ability to balance the tensions and management paradoxes implicit in the drive to achieve superior unit performance while simultaneously collaborating with other units to leverage the organization-wide benefits of integration 


-  Like the first two phases ,  this one is also demanding profound behavioral change among the people who make up General Electric 


-  ,  The major constraint in any corporate transformational process  and the explanation behind the need for the carefully sequenced stages  lies in peoples capacity to accommodate change 


-  Indeed ,  the most successful companies in our study were those that recognized behavioral change as not just an outcome of the transformation but as its driving engine 


-  As  result ,  they focused their attention beyond the conventional concern about restructuring the hierarchy and reengineering its processes ,  and devoted most of their attention to the more subtle ,  demanding task of changing individual attitudes ,  assumptions ,  and behaviors 


-  ,  This realization struck Jack Welch in the mid-1980s ,   few years after he had initiated his bold ,  effective delay-ering and downsizing program that had eliminated several layers of GEs hierarchy and reduced its payroll by 70 , 000 employees 


-  Although he had been extraordinarily successful at meeting his initial objectives ,  Welch understood that he could not achieve his long-term goals unless he won the minds and changed the behaviors of many front-line employees who were suspicious and even cynical about the motivations of  man they had begun to call Neutron Jack 


-  In 1985 ,  he acknowledged to  group of employees ,  A company can boost productivity by restructuring ,  removing bureaucracy ,  and down-sizing ,  but it cannot sustain high productivity without cultural change 


-  ,  Successful corporate transformation ,  as Welch recognized ,  could not simply be imposed from the top through macro change programs 


-  It also had to be built from the bottom through activities designed to ensure that everyone understood and supported the change 


-  An effective change process needs to focus simultaneously on the companys hardware  its business configuration and organization structure  and on its software  the motivations ,  values ,  and commitments of the companys employees 


-  In other words ,  together with the changes in structure and systems ,  managers also need to change what we described in our previous article as the behavioral context of the company 


-  ,  As we observed GE and other companies evolve through the long ,  painful process of transforming bureaucratic hierarchies into self-renewing organizations ,  we became aware of the importance not only of the sequencing of macro processes  simplification ,  integration ,  and regeneration  but also of the changes to individuals behaviors that supported those broader initiatives 


-  The performance-driven actions implicit in Welchs call for speed ,  simplicity ,  and self-confidence ,  for example ,  were different from the more collaborative behaviors he was trying to elicit in his subsequent emphasis on a boundaryless organization 


-  Our observations suggest that discipline ,  support ,  stretch ,  and trust  the four vital elements of the transformational behavioral context  were most effectively developed sequentially in  way that supported the three stages of renewal 


-  Instilling discipline and support ,  for example ,  is crucial to managing the company through the simplification phase; instilling stretch and trust is essential to effective cross-unit integration; and balancing all four dimensions is the key to moving to  state of continuous regeneration 


-  Forced to divest 70 percent of its assets in an antitrust settlement ,  compelled to confront formidable global competitors in  suddenly deregulated business ,  and confronted with an industry fundamentally restructured by the converging technologies of computers and telecommunications ,  AT&T was  dinosaur on the brink of extinction for the first few years after the companys 1984 breakup 


-  Within four years ,  its near monopoly of long distance service had been reduced to  68 percent share ,  its once highly profitable equipment business was staggering under the attack of aggressive competition ,  and its computer business was floundering in  struggling partnership with Olivetti 


-  At this time ,  Bob Allen became CEO and initiated  series of initiatives that illustrate the actions most effective in the first stage of transforming  classic bureaucracy into  self-renewing organization 


-  ,  In  series of early moves ,  Allen signaled  radical departure from the previous integrative activities that management described as AT&Ts single enterprise strategy 


-  By deemphasizing cross-unit coordination ,  he was able to focus attention on simplifying the companys large ,  unwieldy organization ,  breaking it into twenty-one business units ,  each responsible for developing its own business model and for delivering its own results 


-  To reinforce this message ,  he implemented  rigorous economic value-added  ( EVA )  system that recorded and reported the return on capital employed for the newly created business units ,  each of which was required to manage not only its profit and loss account but also its own balance sheet 


-  The business unit managers ,  in turn ,  created more than 100 focused product groups ,  each with its own profit and loss account ,  thereby fragmenting AT&T into more than 100 distinct management units 


-  According to Allen ,  the dramatic improvement in AT&Ts performance during the next five years ,  reflected in the 200 percent increase in the companys market value ,  would not have been possible without the restructuring that allowed front-line managers to simplify their tasks and focus their attention 


-  ,  But simplifying the structure and systems was not enough to change the behavior of individuals who had spent their whole careers in an environment driven by directives ,  policies ,  and constraints 


-  In an organization demotivated by several years of competitive defeats ,  operating losses ,  and personnel cuts ,  Allen saw his main objective as helping our people learn how to win again 


-  While stripping out structural overhead ,  AT&Ts top management was also focused on the huge task of establishing strong norms of self-discipline and building  context of support and encouragement 


-  ,  Over several years ,  Allen and his top management team designed numerous initiatives to shift the internal cultural norm of compliance to  context that encouraged self-discipline 


-  Among these ,  the three that seemed the most influential  and common to other successful change processes we observed  were their attention to unambiguous performance standards ,  their commitment to feedback ,  and their process of clear ,  consistently applied rewards and sanctions 


-  ,  From his first day ,  one of Allens strongest and most consistent messages was that financial success could no longer be negotiated in Washington in discussions among lobbyists ,  lawyers ,  and regulators ,  but instead would have to be won in the marketplace through the actions of front-line managers 


-  Central to this communication effort was his introduction of the EVA concept 


-  As  result of managements relentless insistence that each business prove its economic viability and strategic potential ,  business heads were motivated to translate their broad EVA objectives into  much richer set of internal performance benchmarks that ,  in turn ,  were reflected in clearly defined individual targets right down to the front lines of their operations 


-  Supported by intense communication that helped managers understand the performance impact of their business decisions ,  EVA became more than just  mechanical control system; it became the basis of  behavioral context that resulted in  norm of fulfilling commitments and meeting tough standards   discipline not widely observed in the predivestiture AT&T 


-  AT&T accomplished this with  new accounting system that provided frequent ,  detailed ,  and disaggregated feedback to each unit and was designed to ruthlessly expose the truth about performance 


-  Again ,  it was not so much the system as the way senior management used it that was key to shaping the desired behavioral context 


-  Through their practice of conducting open reviews within each unit and between business units and corporate staff ,  Allen and his top team did more than just define standards and clarify expectations 


-  They used these exchanges to educate management to  new way of thinking and to provide honest ,  timely performance evaluations against the new expectations 


-  The intensity and quality of this review process greatly contributed to the institutionalization of discipline as an established behavioral norm 


-  ,  The third common contextual element in organizations that develop  strong sense of individual discipline is  consistently applied set of rewards and sanctions ,  clearly linked to the performance standards 


-  Equally important ,  the linkage was reinforced by the way senior managers implemented the system ,  not only awarding performance-based bonuses of up to 50 percent of base salary but also replacing managers and even selling or merging units unable to meet their EVA targets 


-  The replacement of  number of key nonperforming managers with outsiders from high-discipline organizations strongly reinforced the emerging norm that managers deliver on their commitments   centerpiece in AT&Ts gradual shift in behavioral context from imposed compliance to internalized self-discipline 


-  ,  Over time ,  however ,  such unalloyed emphasis on results can become corrosive 


-  In the course of our study ,  we found that the radical restructuring called for in the simplification stage was less likely to result in individual burnout or organizationwide rejection if the hard-edged tools of discipline were counterbalanced and complemented by managements nurturing and support of those spurred to action by the rigorous demands of the discipline-based context 


-  As AT&T discovered ,   commitment to legitimate empowerment ,  access to resources ,  and  management style based on coaching and guidance proved most effective in creating such an environment of support 


-  While he was holding business units accountable for their performance ,  for example ,  he was also radically decentralizing responsibility by giving unit leaders the authority to fundamentally change their businesses strategy and operations 


-  Instead of being designed primarily around senior managements control needs ,  reports were explicitly developed to provide disaggregated information to support the operating level managers activities and decisions 


-  At the same time ,  however ,  the system provided AT&T senior managers an effective early warning tool that gave them confidence to loosen their control ,  knowing they had timely ,  reliable information so they could intervene before major problems developed 


-  ,  Allens huge commitment to train new managers to use the data and accept the responsibilities they were given reinforced this systems change 


-  Furthermore ,  Allen took personal responsibility for appointments to all key positions and ensured that his selections were individuals with reputations as delegators and developers 


-  But his own personal management style provided the most powerful empowerment message 


-  He described his philosophy: I have never thought that  could be so knowledgeable about our businesses and markets that  could make the decisions 


-   have always been an advocate of shared decision making 


-  ,  As most companies soon realize ,  empowerment is legitimized only when those given responsibility are also given access to the resources they need to implement their newly delegated decisions 


-  Again ,  Allen initiated radical change by decentralizing many assets and resources traditionally controlled at the corporate level 


-  In  major restructuring of Bell Labs ,  for example ,  he gave business units the authority to control the budgets of more than 80 percent of the labs employees ,  thereby giving them direct access to and influence over AT&Ts enormous technological resources 


-  In middle-level managers view ,  this increased access to financial and technological resources was key to the companys rapid transition from  highly centralized bureaucracy to  more flexible organization in which those deep in operations could initiate and drive action rather than just write proposals and await approvals 


-  They must retreat from their historic roles as chief planners and controllers and redefine their core responsibilities in more supportive terms 


-  In the new environment of radically decentralized responsibility and authority ,  they must provide the coaching and guidance that separates legitimate empowerment from the knee-jerk version that often ends up as abdication 


-  When managers try to escalate issues for his decision ,  he is likely to tell them that his opinion is irrelevant and encourage them to solve the problem themselves 


-  ,  To spread this management model ,  he has broadened the evaluation criteria for all senior managers to include  development measure that AT&T calls people value-added  ( PVA )  ,  which has the same weight as the well-established EVA measure 


-  In typical fashion ,  Allen first applied the new process to himself and his top management team before introducing it to the company 


-  ,  Through  broad array of such tools ,  programs ,  and individual actions ,  AT&Ts management team created  supportive environment that smoothed the hard edges of the highly discipline-oriented demands that they had placed on the organization 


-  Indeed ,  it was this finely balanced change in the companys behavioral context that management felt was central to AT&Ts turnaround from  loss of $1 


-  While this simplification phase can improve the productivity of  companys resources ,  some very different efforts and abilities are required to restart its growth engine 


-  For example ,  although AT&Ts fragmentation into disciplined business units allowed it to reduce waste and cut expense ,  it also led to the creation of twenty-one highly autonomous units run by what one manager described as a bunch of independent business-unit cowboys 


-  Yet ,  to grow  whether by expansion into the dynamic new infocom business at the intersection of the computer ,  communications ,  consumer electronics ,  and entertainment industries or by exploiting the fabulous potential of the emerging Chinese market  the twenty-one entities would have to operate as one AT&T 


-  ,  Between 1993 and 1995 ,  AT&T struggled to turn around the momentum of its highly successful simplification process by creating the necessary coordinating mechanisms for the integration phase 


-  Management initiated  number of structural measures ,  from building  new regional management group to coordinate the disparate international initiatives of the twenty-one business units ,  to creating project teams to address the emerging multi-media ,  data communication ,  and other cross-business-unit opportunities 


-  To support the integrative behaviors required by these structural changes ,  the company made  huge effort to embed  shared vision that focused on how the different parts of AT&T could collectively allow people to communicate with one another anytime ,  anywhere ,  and to articulate shared values as  common bond to tie the whole organization together 


-  Yet ,  after two years ,  the company was finally forced to abandon this effort and break up into three separate entities ,  demonstrating the enormous difficulties of managing the transition from the simplification process to the integration phase 


-  ,  In contrast to AT&Ts difficulties in integrating the company by leveraging the interdependencies across its different businesses ,  ABB Asea Brown Boveri ,  the Swedish-Swiss electrotechnical giant is quite far along this path and illustrates some important requirements for managing the second phase of renewal 


-  Within three months of his appointment as CEO of the $17 billion company formed through the merger of Asea and Brown Boveri ,  Percy Barnevik expressed his vision for the new organization as three dualities: global and local ,  big and small ,  radically decentralized with central reporting and control 


-  For the first few years ,  however ,  Barnevik focused on only one part of each duality: he wanted to build the new company on  solid foundation of small ,  local ,  radically decentralized units 


-  To break the back of the old bureaucracies and strip excess resources ,  Barnevik radically restructured the company into  , 300 legally separate companies ,  giving them control over most of ABBs assets and resources 


-  At the same time ,  he slashed the old hierarchies from eight or nine levels to  structure that had only three management levels between him and the front line 


-  ,  By the early 1990s ,  however ,  Barnevik and his team began to pay more attention to the challenge of ensuring ABBs long-term growth 


-  This task needed the revitalization of activities in  mature set of business operations through the integration of the independent units and numerous acquisitions into  single company 


-  At this stage ,  ABBs managers began to focus on the other half of the dualities as they worked to capture the benefits of the companys size and reach 


-  By more effectively linking and leveraging the resources of the  , 300 local companies ,  ABB used its global scale and scope to build new capabilities in existing power-related businesses ,  to develop new business opportunities in areas like environmental engineering ,  and to enter new markets such as Eastern Europe ,  India ,  and China 


-  ,  Just as the behavioral change in the simplification phase is facilitated through certain changes in structure and process  fragmenting the organization into smaller units and developing simple ,  rigorous ,  and transparent systems ,  for example  the behavioral context that supports integration also requires some changes in the organizational hardware 


-  At ABB ,  the organizational structure designed to create the tension that drives cross-unit collaboration is provided by  carefully managed global matrix with  complementary overlay of boards ,  committees ,  and task forces at all organizational levels 


-  ,  Beyond changes in the organizational hardware ,  just as the simplification phase needs the behavioral software of discipline and support for effective implementation ,  the integration phase needs  behavioral context of stretch and trust to motivate the vital cross-unit collaboration 


-  ,  Stretch is an attribute of an organizations context that enhances peoples expectations of themselves and the company 


-  In observing the integration efforts at companies like General Electric ,  Intel ,  and ABB ,  we identified three elements at the core of the most successful efforts to create an environment of raised personal aspirations and extraordinary collaborative efforts 


-  First was development of shared ambitions that energized the organization; second was the need to establish unifying values to reinforce an individuals commitment to the organization; and third was an ability to give employees  sense of personal fulfillment by linking their individual contributions directly to the larger corporatewide agenda 


-  ,  To decouple individuals from the parochial interests that drive performance in the simplification stage ,  companies need to motivate them to collaborate 


-  In most organizations ,  this implies creating  shared ambition that exceeds the companys ability to achieve without cooperation: to stretch the organizations collective reach beyond each units individual grasp 


-  At the broadest level ,  Barnevik did this by building  corporatewide commitment to making ABB a global leader  the most competitive ,  competent ,  technologically advanced ,  and quality-minded electrical engineering company in our fields of activity 


-  But rather than leave this broadly framed vision statement unconnected to the organizations day-to-day operations ,  he and his top team traveled 200 days  year to communicate and translate it so that each operating unit began to share the ambition and understand its implications for their own particular objectives 


-  For example ,  ABB has  stated objective to contribute to environmentally sound sustainable growth and make improved living standards  reality for all nations around the world 


-  Depending on managements actions ,  such  statement has the potential to become  source either of unifying personal commitment or of organizational cynicism 


-  At ABB ,  Barnevik ensured that the stated values were not just displayed in the annual report but were part of documented commitments in the companys Mission ,  Values ,  and Policies book ,  which insiders referred to as the policy bible 


-  More important ,  the values became the basis for face-to-face discussion between top management and employees at every level and ,  over the years ,  were confirmed by corporate leaders actions as they acquired environmental management capability and committed to massive investments in the developing world 


-  ,  Finally ,  management must deal with the fact that modern societies in general and large corporations in particular provide individuals with few opportunities to feel they are making  difference 


-  To create  sense of stretch ,  companies need to counteract the pervasive meaninglessness that people feel about their contributions and replace it with  sense of personal fulfillment in their work 


-  At ABB ,   whole portfolio of new communication channels and decision-making forums was designed to give front-line managers access to and influence in the companys vital decisions 


-  Through these overlaid devices ,  ABBs top managers were able to invite the heads of national companies to serve on the internal boards of other local units or even on their worldwide business boards 


-  Similarly ,  local functional heads can serve on one of the many functional councils that the company uses to identify and transfer best practice worldwide 


-  Through such service ,  these individuals can see firsthand how they fit into the larger objective and ,  more important ,  how their individual efforts contribute to  broader agenda 


-  It has become  highly motivating characteristic of the companys behavioral context 


-  ,  The ability to link resources and leverage capabilities is central to the integration process ,  and this intensively collaborative behavior cannot be induced solely by stretching peoples goals and expectations 


-  Like discipline ,  stretch lends  hard edge to the behavioral context that gives rise to individual energy and enterprise but ,  in its raw form ,  can also lead to organizational exhaustion 


-  In the second stage of the renewal process ,  the appropriate offsetting quality to stretch is trust ,   contextual characteristic vital to the development and nurturing of the collaborative behavior that drives effective integration 


- 10 ,  Unfortunately ,  the level of trust in  company just emerging from the major restructuring implied by the simplification process is often quite low ,  with autonomous units intensely competing for scarce resources and once loyal employees feeling that their implicit contracts with the company have been violated by serial layoffs and cutbacks 


-  Most of the companies we studied seemed to accept this erosion in individual and group relationships as an inevitable by-product of  necessary process 


-  While they tried to minimize its impact during that phase ,  the task of rebuilding individual and intergroup trust was primarily left to the integration stage when frequent and spontaneous cooperation among individuals and across organizational units became vital 


-  Clearly ,  trust is an organizational characteristic that is built only slowly ,  carefully ,  and with  great deal of time and effort 


-  Among the most common behaviors exhibited by managers in organizations that succeeded in developing this vital contextual element were  bias toward inclusion and involvement ,   sense of fairness and equity ,  and  belief in the competence of colleagues 


-  As we described earlier ,  local company managers were appointed to their business area boards where they participated in decisions affecting their businesss global strategy and operations ,  while their functional managers membership on worldwide functional councils gave them  major role in deciding the policies and developing the practices that governed their area of expertise 


-  ,  This bias toward inclusion and participation extended beyond the formal boards and committees ,  however ,  and ABBs senior managers made employee involvement integral to their daily operating style 


-  For example ,  in one of ABBs business areas that we studied ,  the new global strategy was formulated not by the global business manager and his staff or even by the more inclusive business area board 


-  It was developed by  group of managers drawn from deep in the worldwide operations who were asked to define the businesss objectives ,  options ,  and priorities as perceived by those closest to the customers ,  the technologies ,  and competitive markets 


-  The process of developing this strategy and top managements subsequent approval created  strong bond among those on the team and trust in their superiors 


-  ,  Such widespread involvement in the activities and decisions relating to issues beyond their direct control created  vital openness for creating fairness and equity ,  the second component in  trust-building context 


-  The formal matrix organization  the core design element that management believed allowed ABB to manage the dilemmas in its objective to be local and global ,  big and small ,  radically decentralized with central control  required the development of such an organizational norm to resolve the tension implicit in the structural dualities and to manage the conflicting demands in the strategic paradoxes they reflected 


-  The function of the numerous boards ,  teams ,  and councils was not only to allow widespread involvement but also to create the channels and forums in which often conflicting views and objectives could surface and be debated and resolved openly and reasonably 


-  ,  But fairness cannot simply be designed into the structure; it must be reinforced by managers words and actions ,  particularly at the most senior level 


-  Backed by the policy bibles commitment to build employee relations on the basis of fairness ,  openness ,  and respect ,  ABBs senior management conducted the constant stream of decisions surrounding ongoing plant closing ,  employee layoffs ,  and management reassignments in an environment of transparency and rationality rather than through backroom political maneuvering 


-  The resulting perception of fairness protected and ,  indeed ,  enhanced feelings of trust ,  despite the inherent tensions and painfulness of the decisions 


-  ,  Finally ,  trust requires people to believe in the competence of their colleagues and particularly their leaders ,  because it is in these people that individuals place their confidence as they relinquish the traditional safety of incrementalism to achieve new stretch targets 


-  At ABB ,  Barnevik set the tone in selecting his senior management team 


-  Recognizing that their drastically delayered ,  radically decentralized organization placed  huge premium on high-level competence ,  he personally interviewed more than 400 executives from both Asea and Brown Boveri to ensure that ability assessment rather than horse trading dominated the selection for the top positions in the newly merged companies 


-  His actions not only provided  model that influenced the whole selection and promotion process but also signaled that the identification and development of human resources was  vital management responsibility 


-  ,  This integration process ,  supported by greater cross-unit collaboration ,  has allowed ABB to leverage the onetime productivity gains from the massive simplification program that radically restructured the company between 1988 and 1990 


-  It helped the company develop new products and enter new markets during  recession that caused almost all its competitors to retrench in the first three or four years of the 1990s 


-  It was  critical stage of the renewal process that was made possible by managers behavioral changes framed by an expectation of stretch and supported by  growing culture of trust 


-  ,  The hardest challenge for companies that have reconfigured their structures and realigned behaviors through the simplification and integration processes is to maintain momentum in the ongoing transformation process 


-  This is particularly difficult for companies that have been through two successive processes and are striving to maintain an internal context to support both the individual initiative for driving the ongoing performance of front-line operations and the collaborative team-based behaviors for supporting resource linkages and best-practice transfers across individual entities 


-  The final stage of self-renewal is when organizations are able to free themselves from the embedded practices and conventional wisdom of their past and continually regenerate from within 


-  As ABB executive vice president Gran Lindahl saw it ,  this final stage would be achieved only when he had succeeded in  long ,  intense development process he described as human engineering ,  through which he hoped to change engineers into capable managers ,  and capable managers into effective leaders 


-  Indeed ,  of the many companies that have undertaken organizational transformation programs during the past decade ,  few have moved beyond the rationalization of the simplification stage ,  and even fewer have successfully revitalized their businesses in the manner we have described in the integration process 


-  Nonetheless ,  in our study ,  we observed  handful of companies that had reached the stage of constantly regenerating themselves by developing new capabilities and creating new businesses on an ongoing basis 


-  ,  In most of these companies ,  like 3M in the United States or ISS ,  the Danish cleaning-services company ,  this elusive self-regenerative capability is based on long-established ,  deeply embedded corporate values and organizational norms ,  often linking back to the influence of the founder or other early leaders 


-  But we observed  few companies in which  more recent transformation process led to the creation of this impressive organizational capability 


-   good example is Kao ,  the Tokyo-based consumer packaged goods company 


-  ,  For its first fifty years ,  Kao had been  family-run soap manufacturer ,  eventually expanding into detergents in the 1940s as the company modernized by unabashedly copying leading foreign companies  ( even Kaos corporate logo was amazingly similar to Procter  Gambles famous moon and stars symbol )  


-  Only after Yashio Maruta took over as president in 1971 did the company gradually develop  self-regenerative capability 


-  As Maruta stated ,  Distinct creativity became  policy objective ,  supporting our determination to explore and develop our own fields of activity 


-  By 1990 ,  after it had expanded into personal care products ,  hygiene products ,  cosmetics ,  and even floppy disks ,  Kao was ranked by Nikkei Business as one of Japans top ten companies along with Honda ,  Sony ,  and NEC ,  and ahead of such icons as Toyota ,  Fuji-Xerox ,  Nomura Securities ,  and Canon 


-  ,  In our analysis of Kao and other successful self-regenerating companies like 3M ,  ISS ,  Intel ,  and Canon ,  we developed some notions about two management tasks that inevitably played  central role in the development of such capabilities 


-  The first was an ability to integrate the entrepreneurial performance-driving behavior shaped by the contextual elements of discipline and support with the equally vital cross-unit integrative learning framed by the managerial characteristics of stretch and trust 


-  The second was the somewhat counterintuitive task of ensuring that these basic contextual elements were kept in  state of dynamic disequilibrium to ensure that the system never became locked into  static mode of reinforcing and defending its past 


-  Over the years ,  he embedded two strong Buddhist values and beliefs into Kao as  basis for its self-regenerating capability 


-  Central to this environment was one of the most sophisticated corporate information systems in the world 


-  Instead of designing it to support top managements need for control ,  as most such systems were ,  Maruta had spent more than twenty years ensuring that its primary purpose was to stimulate operating-level creativity and innovation 


-  For example ,  one internal network linked the company directly with thousands of retail stores ,  allowing marketing managers not only to monitor market activity and trends in  direct way ,  but also to give those retailers analyses of store-level data 


-  Kao also developed an artificial intelligence-based market research system that processed huge volumes of market ,  product ,  and segment data to generate clues about customer needs ,  media effectiveness ,  and various other marketing questions 


-   third information gathering process ,  based on Kaos consumer research laboratory ,  combined  traditional monitoring of product usage in  panel of households with an ongoing analysis of calls to customer service 


-  Managers used the integrated output to define new product characteristics and fine-tune existing offerings 


-  ,  In launching the companys new Sofina cosmetics ,  the new-product team members used these and other data resources and intelligence systems to define  product-market strategy that defied the industrys conventional wisdom 


-  They developed  uniquely formulated product line based on technical data and scientific research rather than on new combinations of traditional ingredients; they positioned it as  skin care product ,  rather than on the more traditional image platform; they sold it through mass retail channels rather than through specialty outlets; and they priced it as  product for daily use rather than as  luxury item 


-  ,  Although respect for individual initiative was central to Kaos philosophy ,  so too was the commitment to organizationwide collaboration ,  particularly as  way to transfer knowledge and leverage expertise 


-  Collaboration was aimed at achieving what Maruta described as the power of collective accumulation of individual wisdom and relied on an organization designed to run as  flowing system 


-  ,  Throughout Kao ,  there was much evidence of this philosophy ,  but  most visible manifestation of its commitment to the sharing of knowledge and expertise was the open conference areas known as decision spaces 


-  From the tenth floor corporate executive offices down ,  important issues were discussed in the decision spaces ,  and anyone interested ,  even  passerby ,  could join the debate 


-  Likewise ,  R&D priorities were developed in weekly open meetings ,  and projects were shaped by laboratories hosting monthly conferences to which researchers could invite anyone from any part of the company 


-  In all the forums ,  information was freely transferred ,  nobody owned an idea ,  and decision making was transparent 


-  ,  Through such processes ,  individual knowledge in particular units was transferred to others ,  with the process becoming embedded in policies ,  practices ,  and routines that institutionalized learning as the company way 


-  Similarly ,  isolated pockets of expertise were linked together and leveraged across other units ,  in the process developing into distinctive competencies and capabilities on which new strategies were developed 


-  ,  The vital management role at this stage was to create and maintain an internal environment that not only stimulated the development of individual knowledge and expertise to drive the performance of each operating unit ,  but also supported the interunit interaction and group collaboration to embed knowledge and develop competencies through an organizational learning process 


-  This demanded the creation of  delicately balanced behavioral context in which the hard-edged norms of stretch and discipline were counterbalanced by the softer values of trust and support to create an integrated system that Maruta likened to the functioning of the human body 


-  In what he termed biological self-control ,  he expected the organization he had created to react as the body does when one limb experiences pain or infection: attention and support immediately flows there without being requested or directed 


-  But ,  while  context shaped by discipline ,  support ,  stretch ,  and trust is necessary for organizational regeneration ,  it is not sufficient 


-  It needs  second force to ensure that the contextual frame itself remains dynamic 


-  ,  Less obvious than the task of creating  behavioral context that supports both individual unit performance and cross-unit collaboration is the complementary management challenge of preventing such  system from developing  comfortable level of fit that leads toward gradual deterioration 


-  This capability risks becoming  liability when unquestioned conventional wisdom and tightly focused capabilities constrain organizational flexibility and strategic responsiveness ,  leading the system to atrophy over time 


-  ,  Recently ,  the popular business press has been full of stories about once great companies that fell victim to their own deeply embedded beliefs and finely honed resources  the so-called failure of success syndrome 


-  Digital Equipments early recognition of  market opportunity for minicomputers grew in its strong commitment to VAX computers that blinded managers to the fact that the segment they were serving was disappearing 


-  Despite the widely advocated notion of organizational fit ,  the top-level managers in the self-regenerating companies we studied were much more concerned about doing what one described as putting  burr under the saddle of corporate self-satisfaction 


-  ,  Contrary to their historically assumed role of reinforcing embedded knowledge through policy statements of the company way and reaffirming well-established capabilities as core competencies ,  top managers in dynamic ,  regenerating companies perceive their task to be almost the opposite 


-  While creating  context in which front-line and middle managers can generate ,  transfer ,  and embed knowledge and expertise ,  they see their role as counterbalancing and constraining that powerful process 


-  One approach that Maruta adopted to prevent his management team from too readily accepting deeply ingrained knowledge as conventional wisdom was his practice of discouraging managers from referring to historical achievements or established practices in their discussion of future plans 


-  As one senior manager reported ,  If we talk about the past ,  the top management immediately becomes unpleasant 


-  Instead ,  Maruta constantly challenged his managers to tell him what new learning they had acquired that would be valuable in the future 


-  Yesterdays success formula is often todays obsolete dogma ,  he said 


-  We must continually challenge the past so that we can renew ourselves each day 


-  ,  At  more macro level ,  Maruta created  dynamic challenge by continually alternating his emphasis on simplification and integration 


-  Soon after assuming Kaos presidency in 1971 ,  he initiated the so-called CCR movement ,   major corporate initiative to reduce work-force size through  widespread computerization of activities 


-  This efficiency-driven initiative was followed in the mid-1970s by  TQM program that focused on organizationwide investments and cross-unit integration to improve long-term performance 


-  By the early 1980s ,  an office automation thrust returned attention to the simplification agenda ,  which ,  by the mid-1980s ,  was broadened into  total cost reduction  ( TCR )  program 


-  By the late 1980s ,  however ,  top management was reemphasizing the integration agenda ,  and the companys TCR slogan was reinterpreted as total creative revolution requiring intensive cross-unit collaboration 


-  ,  Through this constant shift between simplification and integration ,  Maruta created an organization that not only supported both capabilities but embedded them dynamically to ensure that no one mode of operation became the dominant model 


-  This organizational context was vital for ongoing business regeneration 


-  ,  Managers in many large companies recognize the need for the kind of radical change we have described 


-  company gave us perhaps the most plausible explanation for this gap between intellectual understanding and emotional commitment to action: The tragedy of top management in large corporations is that it is so much more reassuring to stay as you are ,  even though you know the result will be certain failure ,  than to try to make  fundamental change when you cannot be certain that the effort will succeed 


-  We have seen several companies that made effective ,  sustainable change toward the self-regenerative capability we have described 


-  In all such cases  Motorola ,  GE ,  AT&T ,  ABB ,  Lufthansa ,  and several others  we observed the same sequential process ,  with distinct ,  though overlapping phases of simplification ,  integration ,  and regeneration 


-  At the same time ,  others like IBM ,  Daimler Benz ,  DEC ,  Philips ,  and Hitachi that have tried alternative routes have made little progress until  change of top management led them to something closer to the model we have described 


-  Similarly ,  when such  phased approach failed ,  as it did at Westinghouse ,  it was because changes in the organizational hardware were not matched with changes in the behavioral software 


-  The model we have presented is general ,  and while we have inferred it from observations of practice ,  recent theoretical advances suggest that the particular sequence we have proposed is necessary to break down the forces of organizational inertia 


- 11 ,  We do not mean ,  however ,  that leading  company through such  renewal process will be easy ,  quick ,  or painless 


-  In the process of transformation ,  it goes blind ,  its legs fall off ,  and its body is torn apart ,  as beautiful wings emerge 


-  Similarly ,  the transformation from  hierarchical bureaucracy to  flexible ,  self-regenerating company will be painful and requires the enormous courage of its leaders 


- The information products industry ,  broadly defined to include products based on data ,  information ,  and knowledge ,  is intensely dynamic in terms of growth and the pace of new product introduction 


-  The complexity in the variety of product offerings and the number of firms offering those products in this industry is shown by the fact that there are more than 36 , 000 information product suppliers in the United States; 90 percent of these have less than $1 million in annual sales 


-  Revenues for the information industry are large; for example ,  radio and TV accounted for $54 billion in domestic revenues in 1993; film and recorded music for $35 billion; newspapers ,  books ,  and magazines ,  $85 billion; and business information suppliers ,  another $26 billion 


-  ,  Despite the economic importance and the rapid pace of innovation of this industry ,  no previous research has examined the design and development of information products 


-  Research in the management of innovation and new product development has focused primarily on physical ,  assembled products such as automobiles ,  video-cassette recorders ,  portable cassette players ,  power tools ,  computers ,  and various types of production equipment 


-  This focus has been broadened by studies of innovation in nonassembled products such as ice and glass and of innovation in software products 


-  In this article ,  we focus on information products 


-  We define information products broadly to include information provided in either electronic or printed form and sold to external markets as well as that provided by information systems departments within firms to internal customers 


-  Our research was guided by several basic questions: What can firms in information products industries learn from research on physical products? How are information products designed and manufactured ,  and how can information technology be used to support these processes? More fundamentally ,  what is the architecture of an information product and what are the strategic ,  organizational ,  and technical implications of the architecture for firms competing in this arena? ,  To answer these questions ,  we build on research and knowledge about the design of physical products 


-  We first summarize that research and then extend it into the non-physical realm ,  proposing  framework for the architecture of information products 


-  We then illustrate the architecture framework with data from two information product businesses 


-  The first case ,  Corporate Technology Information Systems ,  Inc 


-  ,  demonstrates how  company can create competitive advantage through the information product platform 


-  The second case ,  Individual Inc 


-  ,  focuses on the process platform and shows strategies for achieving advantage by refining information 


-  We then conclude by considering how companies can manage the architecture of information products to achieve competitive advantage 


-  ,  Other authors have stressed the importance of managing the evolution and renewal of product architecture for sustained competitive success 


-  The architecture of  product refers to its overall design concept 


-  Different architectures result in different product functionality ,  cost ,  quality ,  and performance 


-  Architectures are both  basis for product innovation and  constraint on the variety of product versions that  company can offer 


-  ,  For example ,  Lehnerd described  classic example of product family and platform renewal that Black  Decker achieved in consumer power tools in the 1970s 


-  The old architecture in the companys major tool groups had little in common with other product groups or even within them 


-  Traditionally ,  the company had redesigned its products one at  time 


-  There were more than  hundred different motors ,  which were manufactured on different production lines involving substantial labor content and materials waste 


-  Lehnerd and his colleagues decided to redesign the entire product portfolio ,  utilizing elements of common product architecture for all tools ,  whether  drill ,  sander ,  circular saw ,  or hedge trimmer 


-  On  single ,  high-volume ,  highly automated production line ,  motors for hundreds of different power tool products could be produced at substantially lower per-unit costs 


-  ,  Black  Decker applied this approach to other key subsystems of the product architecture with  similar effect 


-  The result was striking:  drill formerly marketed at $20 was replaced with  more durable ,  lighter drill profitably sold for less than $10 


-  Rather than product architecture constraining product variety ,  Black  Deckers common subsystems enabled variety ,  allowing engineers to focus on the other features of their power tools ,  such as new types of bits ,  sanding surfaces ,  or blades 


-  Product variety increased over time 


-  The companys cost advantage drove dozens of competitors out of the business ,  and its market share in the consumer power tools industry grew from 20 percent to  dominant share during  five-year period 


-  ,  Every product has an architecture 


-  That architecture has the potential to become  platform ,  as in Black  Deckers case ,  if it is explicitly managed and used to create  number of derivative products 


-  For example ,  platforms have formed the basis for creating families of automobile products 


-  Chrysler derived many successful versions of its basic automobile offering from its K-car platform 


-   well-designed platform enables  company to create new versions of its basic product rapidly and efficiently to respond to or anticipate changing market needs  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  In the arena of physical ,  assembled products ,  the effectiveness of  firms new-product generation lies in its ability to create  continuous stream of successful new products during an extended time and in these products attractiveness to the chosen markets 


-  Streams of related products are product families 


-  For physical products ,   family is  set of products that share common technology and address related market applications 


-  The commonality of technologies and markets leads to efficiency and effectiveness in manufacturing ,  distribution ,  and service ,  enabling  firm to tailor each resource or capability more efficiently to specific market niches 


-  ,  The technological foundation of the product family is the product platform architecture or design 


-  Platforms ,  their derivative products ,  and platform extensions or renewals have been described for vacuum cleaners ,  electronic imaging systems ,  portable cassette players ,  and power tools 


-   product family evolves over time by incorporating new technologies into its designs and by targeting new customer requirements 


-   product platform is made up of common subsystems and interfaces for deriving related products 


-   new generation of an existing product platform occurs when the number and types of subsystems and interfaces remain constant but several undergo substantial enhancement 


-   new platform forms an entirely new architecture when subsystems and interfaces from prior generations are carried forward and combined with new subsystems and interfaces in  new design 


-  ,  For an effective platform design ,  the interfaces between subsystems must be seamless and standardized 


-  In an assembled product such as  camera ,  for example ,  subsystems include the shutter mechanism ,  lenses ,  various operator controls and focus mechanisms ,  flash ,  power source ,  and camera housing 


-  Experience suggests the critical importance of specifying clear internal and external interfaces in new product design ,  standardized to the point where the interfaces may be assigned part numbers ,  similar to the components 


-  ,  The process platform is composed of the technologies ,  facilities ,  and processes for manufacturing  firms products 


-  For an assembled product ,  such as  camera ,  the process platform encompasses the stages of producing or sourcing of components  ( with intermediate testing processes )  ,  assembly of the components ,  and final testing 


-  For non-assembled products ,  such as materials and petrochemicals ,  sustained success requires creating and renewing process platforms 


- 10  ( For  general representation of the process platform ,  see Figure  


-  )  ,  For both assembled and nonassembled products ,  the process platform evolves primarily by increasing volume or capacity 


-  However ,  process platforms are also an opportunity for innovation to facilitate greater product variety during  product familys evolution 


-   lack of such innovation ,  in terms of the flexibility built into the production process ,  constrains the variety of product versions derived from the basic process 


-  Abernathy and Hayes noted this in the stagnation of the Model  automobile caused by Fords high-volume but inflexible mass production system 


- 11  study of an industrial manufacturer also showed the problems encountered when management focuses on capacity expansion for its existing manufacturing processes at the expense of introducing new process capabilities 


- 12 ,  Well-designed product and process platforms enable product innovation and the generation of derivative products rapidly and at low incremental cost ,  creating leverage in  firms R&D activities 


-  Each of the two types of leverage that  firm can achieve in  well-managed product family  technological and market  has substantive financial implications 


-  ,  Technological leverage is the extent to which investments in basic product and process platforms  ( either original developments or platforms extensions )  serve as  foundation for efficiently developing derivative products 


-  Thus engineering these derivative products should cost substantially less than the development costs incurred in making the underlying product platform 


-  proposed as  metric of technological leverage the average engineering cost of product derivatives divided by the engineering cost of underlying platforms 


- 13 They found that this measure of platform efficiency for creating derivative products for successful families of industrial measurement systems was in the range of  


- 10 for every dollar of investment in creating the underlying product platform 


-  They also proposed  corollary measure of platform efficiency focusing on time cycles 


-  While product platforms tended to take three to five years of elapsed time to develop ,  derivative products were created in three months to one year 


-  Robust product platforms therefore enable  firm to develop new derivative products and bring them to market in  fraction of the time and cost required to create the underlying product platform 


-  Recent research at  large consumer products company also showed that successful process platforms allow new products to be introduced into manufacturing without excessive ramp-up and retooling costs 


-  ,  The market leverage from  product platform is the return provided on product development investment 


-  proposed  measure of platform effectiveness ,  similar to measures of platform efficiency ,  as the accrued sales for  set of derivative products divided by the total engineering costs of those products 


- 14 For the industrial measurement system families in that study ,  sales of successful product families were from thirty to fifty times engineering costs 


-  Ratios of market leverage vary from industry to industry 


-  For example ,  data gathered from  printer manufacturer showed rates of market leverage across its most successful product platforms to be more than 100 times engineering costs 


-  Market leverage can also be considered as the extent to which product and process platforms enable  firm to diversify from initial target market applications into others that are related by virtue of common customer requirements 


-   robust platform facilitates the type of expeditionary marketing that Hamel and Prahalad describe 


- 15 ,  We have discussed the concepts of product and process platforms as the bases of the evolving product family 


-  We have also described measures of efficiency and effectiveness that apply to the development of physical products 


-  In the remaining sections ,  we extend these concepts to information products 


-  ,  The architecture of information products is not as readily apparent as that for physical products 


-  The internal interfaces are how these parts fit together; the external interfaces are the standardized telephone wire plug and the design and use of the handset and push buttons 


-  The architecture for an information product such as an electronic news service requires rethinking the concepts we have presented 


-  These concepts are critically important because managing the architecture of an information product is as essential to design quality and to  firms survival as managing the architecture of  telephone 


-  ,  Information products exhibit characteristics of assembled and nonassembled products: there are product families ,  product and process platforms ,  and derivative products 


-  Therefore ,  the architecture of an information product reflects an integration of the product and process platforms to generate individual products within the information product family  ( see Figure  for  framework )  


-  ,  We posit that the product platform of an information products business is best viewed as  repository comprising information content and structure 


-  Information content is the data held in the repository that ultimately forms the substance of the information products 


-  The type of business will ,  of course ,  be reflected in the unique content of the repository 


-  For example ,  life insurance companies ,  when underwriting new business ,  may access computerized third-party repositories containing data on physicians examinations ,  blood and urine laboratory results ,  and motor vehicle records 


-  The insurance company ,  in turn ,  may integrate these data into its own internal proprietary repository used to provide products and services to its in-house underwriting ,  claims ,  and research units 


-  ,  Beyond the information in the repository ,  the overall structure and arrangement by which the content is stored ,  manipulated ,  and retrieved is  key design element 


-  The basic structural dimension of the repository is the information unit ,   formally defined atom of information to be stored ,  retrieved ,  and manipulated 


-  For example ,   relational database defines data elements  ( attributes )  as the basic information unit ,  while  more document-oriented repository might define various elements  (  


-  ,  subtitled text segments ,  graphic elements ,  title ,  and byline )  as basic information units 


-  ,  Different businesses tend to employ uniquely meaningful information units 


-  For example ,  in Mead Data Systems Nexis ,   repository of financial statements ,  the footnotes are defined as an information unit 


-   user can then select particular financial statements for analysis based on key attributes of the footnotes 


-  ,  The structure of the repository further includes schemes for labeling ,  indexing ,  linking ,  and cross-referencing the information units comprising the repository content 


-  For example ,  consider  reference catalog listing firms and their products 


-  Printed fact sheets might be stored in binders with tables of contents and indexes for locating information by product or firm 


-  In this case ,  the user looks for the appropriate binder and finds the answer to  particular query 


-  The user queries by company name ,  industry affiliation ,  or product set to find specific information 


-  In another example ,  an electronic newspaper links the text of  story to its headline ,  byline ,  and graphic elements 


-  ,  The repository becomes the foundation from which  firm creates its families of information products 


-  The greater the scope ,  depth ,  and complexity of the platform structure ,  the greater the flexibility for deriving products and thus the greater the potential variety within the product family derived from that product platform 


-  The greater the complexity of the platform structure ,  however ,  the greater the cost and effort to maintain the repository 


-   well-designed repository will enable  firm to mine the most value from the content for  given maintenance cost 


-  ,  The levels of complexity and granularity and the associated scheme for structuring the repository can constrain basic product design 


-  The more ways  firm can slice and dice its repository ,  the greater the potential for rapidly and efficiently creating products for new market niches 


-  Then success becomes  matter of market development to create brand and niche dominance 


-  For example ,  while some book publishers have converted hard copy to electronic media by storing text blocks by subject and others have stored text by chapter ,  some have stored by entire book ,  which offers little flexibility in creating new versions of the basic product 


-  The flexibility in product design from being able to combine subject-oriented text blocks far exceeds that of combining chapters 


-  Yet the flexibility to respond rapidly to customers product requirements carries  high cost of infrastructure development with respect to creating and sustaining the repository structure 


-  ,  We also posit  generalized process platform for information products 


-  The manufacture of information products resembles  refining process ,  composed of five information processing stages: acquisition ,  refinement ,  storage/ retrieval ,  distribution ,  and presentation or use 


-  ,  The process platform may be supported by  process knowledge repository containing the rules by which the information product repository is itself created 


-  These rules are part of the process platform ,  not the product platform 


-  One type of process rule in an information refinery is front-end knowledge 


-  Such rules may include methods to identify source information ,  acquire it ,  refine it ,  and subsequently add it to the firms information repository 


-  For example ,  Lincoln National Reinsurance Company has developed  sophisticated expert system that builds the information repository needed to underwrite life insurance policies 


-  The system electronically determines the information needed by the underwriter and where to get it ,  accesses the appropriate information vendors computers ,  evaluates the information received ,  integrates it within the repository ,  and evaluates the need to acquire additional related information based on what was learned 


-  The back end of the process platform  that is ,  the distribution and presentation of information as products  may also be rule based 


-  For example ,  in subscription-driven markets ,  such as industry analysis ,  rule-based limits guide users as they access on-line publications 


-  Other rules may restrict their access to other products 


-  ,  The two platform elements  the repository and the refinery  combine to enable the generation of specific products  ( see Figure  )  


-  Supporting these respective platforms are the firms core capabilities in computer hardware ,  software ,  and telecommunications ,  its internal knowledge about its business and external knowledge about its current and emerging markets ,  and how it organizes and manages itself 


-  The design of the information technology infrastructure is especially important; it is the information product firms core manufacturing capability and how it administers business 


-  ,  Similar to physical products ,  information product platforms should be the source of considerable technological and market leverage 


-  For an information product ,  technical leverage refers to  firms ability to rapidly and efficiently engineer new products based on the existing common repository 


-  There are several ways in which products can vary: by actual content; by packaging ,  formatting ,  and presentation; by distribution; and by degree of interactivity 


-  The combination of different variations can lead to  range of distinct products within the product family ,  all derived from the same information repository 


-  ,  For example ,  consider the export information databases sold on  CD-ROM by  number of firms 


-  One product could be  printed volume of information for  particular country ,  including import regulations ,  sources of trade financing ,  and sales agents 


-  Another product could be similar information provided on-line through an Internet server 


-  Another product may be an aggregation of individual country information into continental regions ,  printed or placed on-line 


-  ,  Different on-line products provide varying levels of interactivity between the user and information products 


-  Interactivity is the users ability to dynamically select ,  manipulate ,  integrate ,  and format the information to suit particular and changing needs 


-  It is similar to baking  cake: some customers want to start from scratch  ( access to raw data )  ,  others prefer  cake mix  ( access to preprocessed cells or units of information )  ,  while others choose to purchase  ready-made cake from  bakery  ( access to finished reports and analyses )  


-  Providing users direct control over the packaging and content of the product itself can be  highly desirable product feature 


-  As information products become more dynamic  (  


-  ,  interactive TV ,  magazines ,  and information services )  ,  mechanisms to allow individualized ,  useful ,  and relevant feedback to the information supplier will produce even greater product variation 


-  ,  The flexibility to create numerous product derivatives from the repository becomes the basis of  firms ability to realize market leverage from its information assets 


-  Like any other producer ,  the information products firm must identify new market niches that need the firms assets ,  in part or in whole 


-  ,   combination of characteristics makes the information products industry distinct in technical and market leverage 


-  First ,  the pace of market identification and exploitation is often rapid ,  with consequences for the style and process of market R&D 


-   firm that plods along in its market research may never get its product to market ,  while  more agile competitor creates  franchise in  new market niche 


-  Second ,   flexible repository combined with  highly automated refinery can make the incremental cost of creating new products unusually low compared to physical products 


-   new product ,  for example ,  may simply be  matter of performing  different type of sorting function or statistical analysis on the computer 


-  Third ,  information products supported by  computer-based refinery are more easily and dynamically decomposed to create new products 


-  For example ,  textbook publishers can sell chapters of books rather than entire volumes once text is stored and distributed electronically 


-  Fourth ,  ease of product decomposition also enables ease of reintegration to create composite products 


-  In the textbook example ,  new books can be custom designed for particular customers or uses by recombining selected chapters from many books into  new book 


-  Fifth ,  one-time purchases seem to be the exception for information products 


-  Once customers perceive information as valuable ,  they are more likely to provide revenue to the supplier through an ongoing subscription 


-  ,  An information products company entrepreneur described his industry and the opportunities for leverage in it: ,  To sustain product leverage and avoid product obsolescence over the long term ,  we believe that information products companies must also plan for the renewal of their repository and refinery platforms ,  just as  physical products company must renew its product designs and manufacturing processes 


-  Renewing the information product platform requires rethinking the basic content and structure of the information repository to enable more efficient creation of newer versions of existing products or ,  more important ,  introduction of radically new products such as the composites we described earlier 


-  The opportunities include establishing greater depth and detail of information content ,  greater scope of content integration ,  more sophisticated and complex linking structures to facilitate integration ,  and greater standardization in the definition of information units 


-  For example ,   number of information products companies are presently adopting Lotus Notes as  way to electronically distribute and present their information products 


-  We believe that great opportunities lie in renewing the front-end acquisition and refinement stages of the refinery 


-  Here ,  the application of information technology has lagged in many of the firms we have studied 


-  Finally ,  firms seeking to improve their information refineries must also strive to improve and standardize the interfaces between each process stage to achieve  seamless pipeline of information processing within the firm ,  as well as between it and its suppliers and customers 


-  The first case ,  of Corporate Technology Information Systems  ( CorpTech )  ,  focuses on the product platform  that is ,  the information repository  and how products may be derived from that platform 


-  The second case ,  of Individual ,  Inc 


-  ,  focuses on the process platform ,  especially the role of information technology in providing the appropriate processing infrastructure for creating and delivering products to meet market needs 


-  ,  Founded in 1985 ,  CorpTech ,  located in Woburn ,  Massachusetts ,  provides business ,  management ,  product ,  and employment information on 40 , 000  


-  companies operating in technology-intensive industries 


-   team of trained telephone surveyors regularly contacts existing information providers to verify or update company names ,  executives names ,  product descriptions ,  sales levels ,  employment levels ,  and projected growth rates 


-  The data are stored in  computerized relational database that forms the information repository 


-  From this repository ,  the company creates  variety of products using internally developed software for searching ,  formatting ,  and distributing the information 


-  Each product has  subscription orientation ,  whereby customers license the right to use the data and receive timely updates with new information 


-  As our framework suggests ,  each product can be differentiated by its content ,  distribution ,  and presentation 


-  ,  The primary product contains the full database 


-   subscribers sales force might use it to generate leads ,  or university placement offices and employment agencies looking for leads might access information about companies in specific regions and industries 


-  For customers requiring  search and browse capability ,  CorpTech distributes the database via mail on  CD-ROM 


-  Search and presentation of the data is supported by CorpTechs proprietary data access software provided as part of the product 


-  CorpTech also sells  printed version of the product ,  with  national and several regional versions for those without PC support or the need to browse the database interactively 


-  In another derivative product ,  CorpTech generates information for subscribers based on various criteria through  data-on-demand service 


-  ,  Management continually considers ways to process the basic repository data to add new ,  higher value-added products to the family 


-  For example ,  CorpTech recently introduced  newsletter ,  the Technology Industry Growth Forecaster ,  that presents sales and employment growth trends by region and industry and information on companies that are growth leaders in their respective fields 


-  While all these products are packaged and priced differently ,  the company creates all from the same information repository 


-  The repository has grown from  , 000 technology-based firms to approximately 40 , 000 firms 


-  ( For CorpTechs product family map ,  see Figure  


-  ( Figure  shows CorpTechs information repository and refinery process underlying its product family 


-  )  ,  The technical leverage achieved in the form of derivative products is clear 


-  CorpTech has generated  variety of computer-based and printed products by segmenting and analyzing the underlying information repository 


-  The market leverage achieved from these products is shown by cumulative economic benefit: sustained increases in sales accompanied by  healthy level of corporate profitability 


-  ,  We might expect CorpTech to have many competitors because the information it gathers and the process for gathering it is quite simple 


-  Yet CorpTech has used its repository to create  defensible competitive advantage 


-  The sheer size of the repository and labor cost for continual maintenance represents  formidable barrier to entry 


-  Therefore ,  information about these companies has not been free and could not be electronically acquired from  government database 


-  Rather ,  CorpTech has had to generate leads and solicit firms through individualized telephone calls and mailed surveys 


-  Once it reaches firms ,  it focuses on specific characteristics of the companies products 


-  As  result ,  CorpTech has created  front-end franchise with its information suppliers 


-  For their efforts ,  suppliers know that their information will be distributed accurately and professionally 


-  ,  CorpTechs management has viewed the development and maintenance of its repository as  distinct investment area 


-  Since  major focus of data gathering consists of product details ,  CorpTech invested in the development of  proprietary technology classification system early on 


-  This system is an index of product types that are industry and technology specific 


-  The index is based on approximately 15 , 000 generic product descriptors that ,  combined ,  form about  , 000 unique product codes 


-  These product codes are then organized in  hierarchical system that contains 17 specific industries and 255 product areas within these industries 


-  The  , 000 product codes are then applied at the finest level to all the products of  firm participating in the CorpTech research 


-  The careful application of these codes to the products of all the 40 , 000 firms in the repository creates CorpTechs commercial strength and serves as an effective barrier to entry to potential competitors 


-  For example ,  Digital Equipment Corporations products alone are assigned more than 200 unique product codes to allow  granularity of information reporting that can be exceptionally useful 


-  That is ,  as CorpTechs repository of companies and customers grows ,  its position in the middle of this information exchange network becomes ever more valuable to all stakeholders 


-  There is  disincentive for provider companies to withdraw from CorpTechs listing because CorpTech holds the de facto franchise in the target market 


-  Both forces feed on themselves in  reinforcing spiral ,  providing CorpTech with  competitive advantage 


-  CorpTech has been quite successful in building reputation and franchise rapidly to attain  defensible critical mass 


-  ,  in Burlington ,  Massachusetts ,  is  repackager of news information 


-  The firm creates  customized set of news stories for each of thousands of customers ,  based on their unique preferences and needs 


-  Since its founding ,  the companys sales have doubled annually based on the proposition that less information  as long as it is the right information  is more 


-  ( For Individuals platforms and product family ,  see Figure  


-  )  ,  On any given day ,  Individuals information repository is fed with about 20 , 000 news stories indexed and stored in  computerized database 


-  The repository becomes distinctive and valuable because of the companys refining process platform 


-  The firm acquires news stories  ( the raw material )  electronically from about 600 suppliers through computer and telecommunications networks 


-  Next ,  it matches story content to customers reading interest profiles stored as keywords in  database separate from ,  but complementary to ,  the information repository 


-  Using  software search program called SMART ,  the refinery matches the customer profiles to streams of incoming stories ,  prioritizing the matches ,  and identifying those with the highest probability of reader interest 


-  ,  The company has further enhanced its refining process by creating predefined keyword filters or templates by industry and market 


-  Each template contains terminology and company names deemed useful for finding stories relevant to readers interested in  particular industry 


-  Templates currently exist for electronics ,  computers ,  health care ,  biotechnology ,  telecommunications ,  finance ,  energy ,  and government ,  among others 


-  The company employs editorial managers who create and improve industry templates as well as identify additional sources of news information 


-  Then ,  as they receive information ,  they provide feedback on the news stories usefulness 


-  ,  After extracting appropriate stories from the repository ,  Individual formats the selected news stories into one of four product designs and distributes them 


-  The primary product ,  called First! ,  provides the full text of the selected articles via an on-line browser 


-  However ,  through interactive ,  on demand ordering software ,  readers can order the full text for any particular news summary 


-  The third product is iNews ,  an even simpler news-flash service 


-  Last ,  the company supplies  direct feed of its entire repository to  number of large corporations 


-  They may then use their own database software or integrate Individuals repository into their own information 


-  As with CorpTech ,  these products are all priced differently ,  and licensing arrangements are structured on  subscription basis 


-  Individual also has  new product called NewsPage ,  which is  Web home page providing access to all of the companys stories at the broad level of headlines and abstracts 


-  ,  The design of Individuals supporting information technology infrastructure resembles  human organization with different functions allocated to groups operating under  hierarchical control structure  ( see Figure  )  


-  At the front end of the process ,  work is allocated to PCs based on volume and type of source input ,  such as file transfer ,  e-mail ,  telephone lines ,  or satellite 


-  Dozens of PCs gather these data; more can be added as the number of information suppliers increases 


-  Here too ,  the company can add workstations to handle increased volume 


-  Last ,  for the back-end process of product distribution ,  clusters of PCs are organized around the firms products and delivery mechanisms 


-  Attached are dedicated PCs for the respective fax ,  e-mail ,  Notes ,  and direct-feed product variations 


-  As the business grows ,  more clusters can be added 


-  This clustered ,  client/server architecture has allowed Individual to address the great challenge facing any information products company once it has created  winning product design: scaling up production to achieve large-scale volume 


-  has achieved considerable technical leverage in its products and services 


-  The firm has used technology to create leverage in the form of product variety 


-  Each of the four basic product designs is tailored for every customer ,  based on desired information content 


-  These customers may be individuals at various levels in different industries ,  professional work groups needing to share  common subset of the daily news ,  or companies that receive  large portion of the repository and integrate it into their own information 


-  Individual has achieved leverage through  sophisticated ,  automated ,  and proprietary process platform ,  an intelligent refinery that automatically acquires information and filters it for customers with an artificial intelligence tool 


-  The refinery then automatically performs the distribution of customized products with the flexibility to employ the continuous advances in telecommunications technologies 


-  In market leverage ,  the firm is also successful 


-  Sales have continued to double every year 


-  ,  Given that any company may contract for electronic news feeds ,  purchase an intelligent text-based search engine ,  or build  network of PCs and workstations ,  where does Individuals advantage lie? Like CorpTech ,  it deals with  number of information sources ,  many not easily located 


-  Second ,  like CorpTech ,  it has created  franchise in the marketplace 


-  In addition ,  Individual enjoys economies of scale because it can amortize the cost of its news feeds across many customers and products 


-  But its competitive advantage lies mostly in its information refinery 


-  The refinery provides  unique level of service and functionality ,  not only by working directly with customers to create  valuable profile ,  but in gaining knowledge over time of how best to create profiles in general so that they add the most value for given readers 


-  continues to learn via customer feedback and ,  more important ,  to capture that learning 


-  ,  The information architecture concepts we have presented are  major aspect of competitive advantage in information products companies 


-  Robust repositories and refineries have given each the capability to respond quickly and profitably to new market opportunities 


-  For example ,  Equifax ,  with more than  billion dollars in annual revenue ,  traditionally provided credit information to lending institutions 


-  It then expanded its offerings by leveraging its existing product and process platforms to provide risk management information to life and property insurers 


-  Such successes are driven by  combination of entrepreneurial management and strong market focus 


-  They also exemplify senior managements awareness of the importance of acquiring and tailoring information to specific customers needs in rapid ,  increasingly efficient ways 


-  ,  The information repository is something to be managed aggressively for flexibility through modularity and standardization 


-  The repository consists of both information content and the structure by which that information is accessed ,  maintained ,  and enhanced 


-  Thus an information products organization ,  whether it publishes periodicals or provides on-line services ,  must first define its own repository 


-  This requires thinking more deeply ,  both within and across particular products and markets 


-  ,  The basic idea is to redesign the architecture underlying the product family or portfolio en masse ,  rather than to create new versions of individual publications ,  hard copy or otherwise ,  on  single product-by-product basis 


-  We suggest that an information products company address these questions: ,  An information products company can apply the repository structure laterally across different products to create product variety for customers ,  as shown in Figure  


-  Common information units are at the left of the figure ,  with noncommon information units at the bottom 


-  Across the top are the various product lines in the companys portfolio 


-  The inventory of content within these products is done by information unit and indexed accordingly 


-  The typical publisher currently distributes the standardized versions of each product to customers as hard copy 


-  Increasingly ,  through electronic search and distribution mechanisms ,  new customers will create their own customized publications by accessing the information unit inventory and selecting what they wish to receive 


-  Many publishers are creating new subscription and advertising revenues by turning to this electronic on-line form of customized publication that leverages content from existing magazines 


-  ,  Ziff-Davis Interactive in Cambridge ,  Massachusetts ,  the on-line division of Ziff-Davis ,  is  classic example 


-  It has taken the content of its computer-related magazines and placed them on-line with many of the leading on-line service providers  ( such as America Online and the Microsoft Network )  


-  For example ,  it has recently introduced  three-dimensional interactive world called Terminal Reality ,   mock-up of LaGuardia Airports main terminal that was developed with software from InterVista Software in San Francisco 


-  Users visiting this site on the Internet can walk around ,  browse the virtual magazines at  newstand ,  and in the future ,  we suspect ,  board airplanes to visit such places as virtual trade shows 


-  ,  As we prepared our business courses ,  we accessed an Internet site developed by  division of McGraw-Hill called PRIMIS 


-  It has gathered  wealth of publications ,  such as articles ,  cases ,  and textbook chapters ,  for  host of subject areas that professors can peruse ,  select ,  and customize into  textbook 


-  In another example ,  International Data Corporation gathers information on market growth trends and vendor participation rates in  host of computer-related market segments and packages these data into fifty different reports that are distributed as hard copy and electronically through Lotus Notes 


-  IDCs ability to mix and match the information contained in its various industry-focused repositories enables it to rapidly create new composite reports for emerging markets 


-  ,  Once  company defines the structure of its repository and makes an inventory of information units within that structure ,  it must then carefully consider the standard mechanisms by which it or its customers may integrate or combine information units 


-  For PRIMIS ,  the integration problem is simple: individual items are simply assembled into  customized text and sent to the professor for final approval 


-  However ,  in other situations ,  integration may be complex and require additional resources 


-  For example ,  IDC develops market forecasts for various market segments in the computer industry 


-   customer requesting an aggregate report containing information on multiple market segments will demand that individual forecasts be reconciled into  reasonable whole 


-  ,  Companies tend to think about how information is refined ,  integrated ,  and published in technological ways 


-  However ,  the improvement of the information refinery is essentially  redefinition of how the business works 


-  ,  We have yet to visit an information products company that is not looking at the World Wide Web and tools such as Lotus Notes and HTML home-page development kits for electronic distribution of its products 


-  Many have placed their publications on-line in part or in whole by creating Web servers 


-  ,  The greatest potential for redefining the information refinery comes from more careful application and integration of both human and technological capital to the front end of the process ,   


-  ,  the acquisition ,  refining ,  and synthesis of raw information 


-  In redefining its information refinery ,   firm might ask three key questions: ,  From the answers ,  managers can begin to think about how better to structure their organizations information refinery ,  applying both management and technology to improve work with functional stages and integration between them 


-  ,   peer-reviewed academic journal provides an example 


-  Typically ,  authors write an article on  word processor and add bibliographic references from their computer database of authors and publications 


-  The editor reads the printed material ,  likes it ,  calls potential referees ,  and mails the anonymous article to several referees for blind review 


-  The referees then draw on related articles in their own file systems ,  type their criticisms into their word processors ,  and print and mail them to the editor 


-  The editor assesses them ,  packages them with an accompanying letter ,  and mails the lot back to the authors 


-  Once the article is accepted for publication ,  the editorial staff people transfer files from the floppy disk to their own computers ,  do line editing ,  and prepare graphics 


-  By the time the final product is scheduled for publication ,  typically within  year of acceptance ,  the thrill of publication has passed 


-  ,   new refinery for the journal might use technology to help authors ,  editors ,  reviewers ,  and readers get on with their respective activities faster and more effectively 


-  The journal could create  Web site on the Internet through which authors could submit new articles and where editors and reviewers could pick up time-stamped versions and attach their criticisms and editorial revisions 


-  The journal could maintain previously published articles ,  indexed by subject matter and author ,  on the Web site ,  so that authors and reviewers could quickly access specific managerial frameworks ,  data ,  or bibliographic references to help them write ,  critique ,  and respond 


-  The editorial staff could also identify Internet links to other repositories of articles and data and build these into the journals home page for the authors and reviewers convenience 


-  Once an article was accepted by the editorial board ,  the staff could edit and prepare graphics directly on text and graphic files on the server ,  with more direct communication to authors 


-  ,  For the back end ,  the new refinery could facilitate faster access to accepted articles through customized ordering of articles 


-  The journal would still produce its printed products for subscribers ,  including complete issues and reprints 


-  At the same time ,  readers could peruse abstracts of forthcoming articles and order  complete copy of articles through the server 


-  ,   multitude of academic ,  industry ,  and mass market publications are implementing the scenario we have painted 


-  Most academics have e-mail addresses and access to the Internet ,  which now handles multimedia objects as readily as text 


-  The greatest challenge ,  of course ,  lies beyond the technology: journal managers ,  their staff ,  academics ,  and readers have to learn to communicate and work in new ways 


-  ,  If we were discussing physical products such as power tools or automobiles ,  we would identify the subsystems and interfaces of  common product platform 


-  But since we are talking about intangible information products ,   different terminology is more appropriate: information units instead of subsystems ,   repository instead of  product platform ,  and an information refinery instead of an assembled or nonassembled production process 


-  However ,  the meaning and application of the basic product and process platform concepts are indeed very similar between both classes of products ,   


-  ,  Repositories and refineries exist merely to serve the needs of the products that the firm wishes to create 


-  In turn ,  these products exist solely to serve the needs of customers 


-  Thus ,  as with any physical product ,  customer needs must drive the design of information products 


-  ,  Two categories of customer needs shape product development 


-  Market research departments are adept at identifying these known needs by studying competitors products and administering surveys 


-  However ,  learning what customers explicitly know only takes  firm farther down the path of incremental innovation 


-  ,  What is far more difficult ,  but more rewarding and exciting ,  is to uncover those needs that users have but cannot clearly express ,   


-  ,  latent ,  unperceived needs 


-  We believe that such needs lie at the heart of new platform design 


-  If the architecture can satisfy these needs ,  an enterprise can bring new excitement to an industry and generate additional levels of demand ,  even in traditional ,  mature businesses 


-  ,  For example ,  how many of us could clearly express the need for an inexpensive color ink-jet printer? But once Hewlett-Packard introduced its color Desk-Jet line ,  vast numbers of people said ,  Thats exactly what  need 


-  HP found itself riding  tidal wave of newly created demand for nonlaser printers 


-  The new platform made something possible that was not possible before: users could print in color on  reliable unit costing about $500 


- 18 ,  The same idea holds true for intangible products 


-  The managers of an information products company must charge its best new-product thinkers to identify latent customer needs 


-  Only then can they define the design of the companys information repository and refinery so that they can deliver what people need in  pleasurable ,  convenient manner 


-  This is especially important for information products ,  such as those appearing fresh on the Internet almost daily ,  in which customers often have relatively little purchasing experience relative to most physical products 


-  It changed America ,  bringing products formerly constrained by the physical proximity of manufacturers and retailers right to the doorstep of rural America 


-  Before mail-order distribution ,  most users could not conceive of not going into  store to buy something 


-  But once mail-order catalogs became fully featured ,  they were exactly what vast numbers of consumers realized they needed 


-  Similarly ,  before on-line shopping on the Internet became available ,  if you asked consumers how they preferred to buy goods ,  most would answer in  store or through  catalog 


-  Yet ,  now that there is on-line shopping ,  on either TV or the computer ,  there are significant growth opportunities for  broad variety of firms 


-  ,  What will be the next wave of demand based on  need that consumers have but have not yet clearly expressed? Take two friends ,  for example ,  one living in Massachusetts and the other in California ,  who want to go on  camping trip in the Caribbean 


-  Each logs onto the Internet ,  and together they go to  particular World Wide Web server that has descriptions ,  pictures ,  and reservation facilities for campgrounds on the islands 


-  They browse through the portfolio together ,  discuss ideas through the computer ,  make  decision ,  and reserve  site 


-  Then they call up another Web server that contains  virtual shopping mall and walk together into  virtual store of camping supplies 


-  One of them then orders the products through the computer with an electronic funds transfer 


-  ,  Our two friends ,  if asked today ,  might consider this scenario preposterous  ( unless ,  of course ,  they work for  software company or an on-line services provider )  


-  The repositories of most travel and retail concerns do not currently have the logical and physical structure to support this type of complex ,  distributed ,  and interactive activity 


-  However ,  many firms are working hard to change this ,  using new technologies such as three-dimensional Internet browsers to create and sustain electronic communities ,  teams ,  and individual liaisons 


-  It would clearly make it possible for them to go shopping together even though they live far apart 


-  ,  Because timing will always be critically important for information products companies ,  firms that first identify emerging markets get  step ahead 


-   modular ,  flexible repository backed by an efficient refinery will help firms to quickly establish market franchises by rapidly offering new products targeted to their customers specific interests and needs
