- For 50 years ,  management theory and practice have adopted  technical ,  analytical approach in which the role of the so-called soft factors like emotions and feelings has largely been denied 


-  That trend is now being reversed ,  with both academics and managers recognizing the powerful role that emotions play in shaping corporate behavior 


-  The real challenge ,  however ,  is to link emotions to performance goals and objectives 


-  The central leadership responsibility is to ensure that the companys vision and strategy capture peoples emotional excitement ,  engage their intellectual capacities ,  and produce  sense of urgency for taking action 


-  In essence ,  it is  task of unleashing organizational energy and marshaling it in support of key strategic goals 


-  )  ,  Research suggests that the best leaders first mobilize organizational energy ,  then focus it 


-  But how to define  force like the wind ,  both invisible and powerful? Organizational energy is seen only in its effect: the force with which  company functions 


-  Just as burnout is said to have three dimensions  ( emotional ,  cognitive and physical )  ,  so is organizational energy considered the interplay among  companys emotional ,  cognitive and physical states 


-  Though difficult to directly observe or measure ,  organizational energy is palpable when put to use  driving the intensity ,  pace and endurance of  companys work ,  change and innovation processes 


-  ,  Organizational energy is related but not identical to the sum of the energy of individuals 


-  Individual energy ,  especially of leaders ,  influences organizational energy ,  and the energy state of the organization affects the energy of individuals 


-  Long recognized by managers ,  the distinction between individual and organizational energy is now receiving more attention in academic circles 


-  ,  Companies differ in both intensity and quality of energy 


-  Intensity refers to the strength of organizational energy as seen in the level of activity ,  the amount of interaction ,  the extent of alertness and the extent of emotional excitement 


-  Symptoms of low energy are often obvious: apathy and inertia ,  tired-ness ,  inflexibility and cynicism 


-  Qualitatively ,  organizational energy can be characterized as positive energy  ( for example ,  enthusiasm ,  joy and satisfaction )  or negative energy  ( fear ,  frustration or sorrow )  


-  In fact ,  it is the intersection of intensity and quality that determines an organizations energy state ,  which usually falls into one of four categories 


-  )  ,  Although different parts of an organization can be mapped to different energy zones ,  most organizations are characterized by one particular zone at any given point 


-  The exception would be  highly diverse and decentralized company ,  in which the business unit may be the most appropriate level for analyzing and managing energy 


-  Sometimes diverse energy states within one company suggest the need for greater intraorganizational integration 


-  ,  Companies in the comfort zone have low animation and  relatively high level of satisfaction 


-  With weak but positive emotions such as calm and contentedness ,  they lack the vitality ,  alertness and emotional tension necessary for initiating bold new strategic thrusts or significant change 


-  ,  For  long period before its listing in the London Stock Exchange ,  Old Mutual Plc  South Africas dominant insurance company  exemplified this energy state 


-  Populated with decent ,  educated people  almost entirely white  and widely considered upright and responsible ,  Old Mutual was South Africas Ma Bell 


-  They spoke politely ,  avoided contentious issues and worked at  steady pace 


-  The financial results ,  although not spectacular ,  were average ,  and the company was well-liked 


-  ,  Post-apartheid ,  Old Mutual began to experience aggressive competition in financial services ,  along with new opportunities ,  such as international expansion 


-  OMs new leadership recognized the need for drastic action: changing the legal structure ,  establishing  corporate center in London and launching  massive transformation program 


-  ,  Companies in this energy state demonstrate weak ,  negative emotions  frustration ,  disappointment ,  sorrow 


-  People suffer from lethargy and feel emotionally distant from company goals 


-  ,  Aktiebolegat SKF  the Swedish company that invented the bearing business  was in the resignation zone for most of the last two decades 


-  It was only modestly profitable despite outstanding technology ,  brand strength and global footprint 


-  Market share inched down ,  and there was constant incremental restructuring and rationalization 


-  ,  An engineers company ,  SKF was always attractive to technically qualified ,  mild-mannered people who disliked open competitiveness 


-  Until Sune Carlsson  ( CEO from September 1998 to April 2003 )  jolted SKF into action ,  SKF managers operated in  state of mild frustration 


-  ,  Companies in the aggression zone experience internal tension founded on strong ,  negative emotions 


-  Tension drives their intensely competitive spirit ,  which manifests itself in high levels of activity and alertness  and focused efforts to achieve company goals 


-   software company  operates in the aggression zone 


-  Employees live by the mantra: Its never good enough to win; all others must lose 


-  Oracles comparative advertising reinforces this intensely aggressive culture 


-  Driven by individual-level financial incentives and CEO Larry Ellisons personal embodiment of aggressiveness ,  Oracle has attracted employees who love to fight and win 


-  ,  Directing that aggressiveness toward competitors has led to outstanding results for Oracle 


-  Salespeople earn double commission whenever Oracle products or services supplant those of its main competitors 


-  At each stage of its evolution ,  Oracle has surpassed competitors: Remember Ashton-Tate? asked Ellison ,  two years before his 2003 unsolicited bid to acquire PeopleSoft Inc 


-  ,  In the passion zone ,  companies thrive on strong ,  positive emotions  joy and pride in the work 


-  Employees enthusiasm and excitement mean that attention is directed toward shared organizational priorities 


-  Perrin stimulated organizational exuberance for 20 years and moved the French luxury products company from $50 million to $1 


-  ,  Although the Perrin-led Cartier engaged in intense competition with Rolex ,  Chanel and Christian Dior ,  competitors were never its focus  creativity was 


-  Well-established Cartier norms strengthened that passion for creativity ,  including one requiring that all new products bridge the old and the new 


-  Designers were to capture the zeitgeist of an early Cartier piece and combine it with inspiration from the finest contemporary art 


-  Companies in the comfort zone or the resignation zone operate at low levels of attention ,  emotion and activity 


-  Companies in the aggression zone or the passion zone display higher levels of focused emotional tension ,  collective excitement and action taking 


-  ,  High-energy companies display an urgency that makes them more productive 


-  Being constantly alert allows them to process information and mobilize resources quickly 


-  Low-energy companies prefer standardization and institutionalization 


-  They try to avoid the surprises ,  exceptions and risks on which high-energy companies thrive 


-  ,  High energy helps align employees perceptions ,  emotions and activities 


-  Low-energy organizations suffer from conflicting priorities and lack of cooperation; high-energy companies bundle and channel their forces for shared goals ,  creating  foundation for organizational cohesion 


-  ,  Energy is not an unmixed blessing ,  however ,  and unless managed wisely ,  it can degenerate into one of three main pathologies or energy traps 


-  Companies that keep adopting major change initiatives without making time for regeneration are susceptible to the acceleration trap 


-  Most change-management programs assume that the change is an exceptional episode 


-  In reality ,  most employees contend with ongoing change ,  which tends to dilute the credibility of management demands to give ones all 


-  ,  But ABB was continuously under pressure ,  and the strains began to show 


-  For example ,  according to numerous media reports and our interviews and research ,  internal conflicts in the power-generation sector mushroomed 


-  What had formerly been  healthy level of tension in ABBs organizational energy degenerated into intense rivalries 


-  ,  In September 1998 ,  new CEO Gran Lindahl added one more initiative to the already tired company:  drastic reorganization 


-  Once again ,  people had to forgo established relationships orchestrated by mature geographical managers and start working for young ,  ambitious and aggressive business-area executives 


-  ,  Classic organizational exhaustion resulted ,  bringing with it fragmented managerial attention and increased difficulty with prioritizing 


-  Pressured field managers ended up spinning their wheels 


-  The exhaustion caused Lindahl and his successor ,  Jrgen Centerman ,  to exert even more pressure ,  and the acceleration trap finally took complete hold of the company by 2002 ,  with little reserve energy left to revitalize this nearly burned-out organization 


-  ( Today ,  under CEO Jrgen Dormann ,  there are positive signs ,  but he nevertheless has  tough fight ahead to ensure the companys survival 


-  Energy is first built as  capacity   potential for intense action  and then that capacity must be used in phases 


-  Successful application of organizational energy is self-reinforcing ,  expanding the energy potential 


-  To manage the process of creating and deploying energy ,  managers must adopt  rhythm of highly intense and less intense phases 


- 10 ,  Weakening  companys ability to leverage resources is the inertia trap 


-  This trap ensnares victims after too long  stretch of either success or poor performance 


-  ,  Long success in  stable environment may convince companies  ( say ,  Old Mutual )  that they have found the ideal system 


-  As long as the environment does not change too radically ,  the companys tight alignment of strategy ,  organizational structures and culture improves performance 


-  But inevitably the environment does change 


-  The alignment becomes  handicap as companies find they cant muster the energy to overcome its rigidity 


- 11 Similarly ,  with too long  stretch of operating below capacity ,  companies lose elasticity  ( like SKF )  


-  Mediocrity makes them lose confidence; they become either reactive or passive 


-  ,  Old Mutual escaped inertia by initiating  listing on the London Stock Exchange 


-  The complete change in OMs operating context and its new ,  forceful leadership jolted managers out of complacency 


-  In SKFs case ,  Carlsson and ,  later ,  Tom Johnstone openly broke with company norms to focus on productivity and profitability 


-  ,  When  company faces external threats  ( or opportunities )  at the same time as it confronts internal discord ,  it may fall into the corrosion trap 


-  Instead of working together to meet external challenges ,  people channel their energy into internal fights 


-  We have observed that often the behavior of senior managers is responsible 


-  Leaders who act in  patently self-interested way or demonstrate little personal involvement with the external challenges erode peoples passion for business ,  their optimism and their readiness to collaborate 


-  ,  Consider one large ,  Europe-based corporation that suffered  crisis in 2002 


-  Senior managers successfully created  sense of urgency that employees could identify with ,  and workers manifested their commitment by accepting  modest 3% raise 


-  The sense of betrayal was corrosive ,  leading to massive strikes and the frostiest labor relations in company history 


-  In the end ,  top management was obliged to leave 


-  ,  Corrosive energy leads to self-reinforcing negativity 


-  Because people unconsciously respond to one anothers emotional displays by imitating or exaggerating them ,  even relatively minor events evolve into negative emotions that spiral out of control 


- 12 ,  When Paul Lego was at Westinghouse Electric Corp 


-  ( between 1990 and 1993 )  ,  his arrogance and isolation within  coterie of favorites led to  breakdown of trust and self-confidence among managers 


-  Divisional heads focused anger on colleagues rather than on outside competitors 


-  Eventually ,  the corrosive forces of internal rivalry destroyed the company 


-  ,  Companies that succeed at radical change generally adopt one of two approaches for unleashing and channeling organizational energy: the slaying the dragon strategy  ( moving into the aggression zone by focusing peoples attention ,  emotions and effort on  threat )  ,  or the winning the princess strategy  ( moving into the passion zone by building enthusiasm for an exciting vision )  


- 13 On the rare occasions when  company can combine the strong positive and negative emotions of both zones ,  the results are spectacular 


-  Companies with neither strategy fall victim to an energy trap and decline to mediocrity or to crisis 


-  ,  This strategy involves  clear articulation of an imminent threat ,  the release of strong ,  negative emotions and the channeling of those emotions toward overcoming the threat 


-  Threats such as bankruptcy ,   dangerous competitor or  disruptive technology require moving employees from the comfort or resignation zone to the aggression zone 


-  )  ,  In July 1990 ,  when Dutch giant Philips Electronics shocked the financial world with  huge loss ,  the semiconductor division was the primary culprit 


-  The new division CEO ,  Heinz Hagmeister ,  moved employees from the comfort zone  ( people in the profitable passive-components business )  and others from the resignation zone  ( those in unprofitable integrated circuits )  to the aggression zone 


-  ,  Jan Timmer ,  the new corporate CEO ,  started the ball rolling 


-  In  senior-team meeting that came to be called Centurion  ,  he presented  dummy newspaper postdated by seven months with the headline Philips Declares Bankruptcy 


-  Only drastic cost cutting would avert bankruptcy 


-  ,  Hagmeister used the same shock therapy within his division 


-  revealed dramatic gaps not only in inventory levels ,  sales expenses and overall costs ,  but also in customer delivery and in the time it took to develop new products 


-  Given the crisis in the overall company ,  divesting  ( or even closing )  the semiconductor division was  real possibility 


-  ,  Having aroused strong negative feelings ,  Hagmeister channeled them into dragon slaying 


-  He created projects for reducing head count ,  cutting sales cost ,  improving delivery time ,  pruning the product portfolio and integrating the  


-  arm of the business into the divisional structure 


-  For each project ,  managers specified accountability ,  milestones ,  measurements and deadlines 


-  In some instances ,  the majority of team members had no other operational responsibility 


-  By means of  regular review ,  called Centurion II ,  executives monitored the progress of each project in detail ,  backed by new norms 


-  ( For example ,  managers offering excuses were asked to leave the meeting and were allowed to return only after devising  new plan consistent with the agreed-on goals )  


-  He stayed engaged ,  never avoiding or delegating  necessary task because it was unpleasant 


-  People must experience the threat personally in order for collective emotions to be unleashed 


- 15 Second ,   highly disciplined process must channel the emotions 


-  Third ,  leaders must continuously guide ,  monitor and control the process 


-  Their visible involvement and personal commitment are essential 


-  ,  Because anger ,  fear ,  hate or shame are such powerful emotions ,  slaying the dragon can effectively shock people into action 


-  However ,  the strategy has its downside 


-  Sometimes it leads to organizational myopia ,  with people overly focused on one well-defined threat 


-  Also ,  companies with the slay-the-dragon strategy rarely create major innovations or succeed in building new growth trajectories 


-  And once the dragon is slain ,  there may be  rush for the comfort zone 


-  ,  This strategy relies on strong ,  positive emotions  ( excitement ,  enthusiasm )  to move people into the passion zone 


-  To engage peoples dreams and openness to heroic effort ,  leaders have to create an object of desire  the princess  and invoke passion so strong that people will overcome passivity and satisfaction with the status quo 


-  ,  As the new century dawned ,  few companies were changing as fundamentally as Sony 


-  Historically  producer of analog-technology-based stand-alone audio and video products ,  Sony was confronting  transformation of its business 


-  The IT ,  media and consumer electronics industries were converging toward  digital ,  Internet-based home entertainment business 


-  Sony CEO Nobuyuki Idei articulated  new vision to enlist the organization in an adventure: Young and old alike are truly mesmerized by digital technology ,  he said 


-  We must also become dream kids at all levels of Sony to create something new ,  something that will meet our future customers expectations 


-  ,  To make the princess real ,  Idei created VAIO World ,   way for Sonys employees to visualize how linking Sonys diverse offerings could help the company excel at meeting the new worlds entertainment requirements 


- 17 ,  Although its too early to judge whether Sony will be successful with its winning-the-princess strategy ,  Ideis vision has dispelled the self-doubt that many within the company were voicing and has created an energy spurt resulting in new VAIO computers 


-  ,  Thus ,  slaying the dragon requires high-energy ,  brave and commanding leadership; winning the princess needs calm ,  gentle ,  inspiring and empathic leaders 


-  Because the former strategy channels aggressive energy into disciplined execution ,  it requires top-down instructions and meticulous plans 


-   strategy that unleashes passion ,  however ,  needs leaders who create an environment of curiosity ,  excitement and ownership 


-  When his first call for  new personal computer found no volunteers ,  he did not force anyone to develop one 


-  Instead ,  he and Kunitake Ando ,  who later assumed the role of Sonys chief operating officer ,  created the VAIO Center ,   virtual organization intended to help employees from all product divisions fall in love with the concept 


- 18 ,  Making people see ,  believe in and commit to an opportunity is inherently more difficult than getting them to acknowledge  threat 


-  The first and most difficult task in pursuing the winning-the-princess strategy is to define ,  describe and substantiate the intangible 


-  It must be simple ,  clear ,  convincing and moving 


-  Second ,  leaders must embody that vision 


-  Their personal credibility and symbolic actions are key in attracting and retaining peoples commitment ,  suppressing the noise of day-to-day activities and creating space and excitement for what is initially  fragile aspiration 


-  Third ,  leaders have to balance the often playful activities involved in seeking an intangible future with the comparatively unexciting protection of the ongoing business 


-  ,  The ideal would be to combine the aggression zones immediacy ,  discipline and decisiveness with the passion zones enthusiasm ,  joy and pride 


-  But its  major challenge to blend top-down ,  planned change that is focused on survival with the experimentation ,  creativity and playfulness of pursuing  long-term vision 


-  One risk is that the contradictions and ambiguities inherent in integrating the strategies might lead to the worst of all worlds in which neither works 


-  ,  The only way to combine the two strategies is to create  path to the princess that automatically involves slaying the dragon that is ,  to envision  future that can only be realized if current problems and threats are overcome ,  as Larry Ellison is attempting to do in his dramatic makeover of Oracle 


-  ,  The princess  ( the vision )  is to see Oracle transform the IT industry into  utility ,  with hardware ,  data and applications residing in  central location and customers gaining access to them over the Internet 


-  In such  world ,  Oracle would evolve from  database company into  provider of integrated services ,  covering  full range of mutually compatible applications 


-  In addition to buying database products from Oracle ,  customers would rely on Oracle for all applications   fully integrated product and service offering 


-  ,  To Oracle employees ,  the princess is clear  if they succeed in making Ellisons vision  reality ,  they would be part of the worlds dominant software company 


-  To any software engineer ,  the idea of people everywhere in the world being able to access the full power of IT using only  PC and  Web browser has enormous intellectual and emotional appeal and thus is likely to spur involvement 


-  ,  But the dragon is built into the strategy 


-  In order to make the vision credible to customers ,  Oracle had to become its own test site 


-  Eat your own dog food ,  Ellison said ,  when he announced  target of saving $1 billion by adopting the approach internally 


-  Between 2000 and 2001 ,  the company succeeded in moving its operating margin from 14% to 37% 


-  This strategy is also in keeping with Oracles hotly competitive spirit 


-  For if the vision were to be realized ,  key competitors would suffer: IBM would lose its main source of revenue  systems integration  and Microsoft would cease to control business customers IT access 


-  ,  Leaders at some companies do not have  choice of strategy for creating energy 


-  If the company faces  visible threat ,  it has to create  dragon: Princesses mean little to people worried about survival 


-  Similarly ,  when there really is no imminent threat ,  no leader can make  dragon credible 


-  In most cases ,  however ,  the situation is neither black nor white ,  and managers have  choice 


-  ,   sound strategy choice is rarely founded on external factors such as competition or market climate 


-  Internal organizational factors are more significant ,  in particular these three: top-management style ,  the companys existing energy state and its organizational heritage 


-  ,  First is senior managers behavior or style 


-  When managers try to behave at cross-purposes to their true nature ,  they create cynicism ,  not energy 


-  Most CEOs are inherently better leaders of one or the other strategy ,  and their companies are more likely to succeed when the strategy meshes with the leaders natural style 


-  ,   second criterion for strategy choice is the existing energy state of the company 


-  Slaying the dragon is easier to implement and more effective for unleashing energy in companies caught in the comfort zone 


-  Given  state of relative satisfaction ,  it is difficult to create excitement and sustainable energy in these companies by calling for  better future 


-  Companies trapped in the resignation zone ,  in contrast ,  already perceive  discrepancy between the reality and the ideal 


-  Winning the princess is best here because it can more easily transform latent desire into productive energy 


-  Companies experiencing low ,  negative energy have  harder time trying to slay dragons ,  because they risk sinking into deeper despair and passivity ,  even paralysis 


-  ,  Third ,  company history matters 


-  Its  lover not  fighter and prefers to spend its energy on creating new products that customers could not have imagined 


-  Winning the princess comes more naturally to  company that began with the express purpose of allowing engineers to have fun at work by playing with new technologies 


-  Oracles history ,  in contrast ,  is more like the history of the samurai warriors that Ellison is known to admire 


-  ,  In short ,  organizational energy creates the necessary combination of cognitive ,  emotional and action-taking capabilities and aligns the resulting force to achieve business goals 


-  That is why ,  without  high level of energy ,   company cannot achieve radical productivity improvements ,  cannot grow fast and cannot create major innovations 


-  It is time that corporate leaders acknowledge this simple reality and begin to pay explicit attention to how they can unleash the energy their organizations need if they are going to achieve the kind of performance they seek
