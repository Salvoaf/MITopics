- About halfway through the Wall Street Journals recent ECO:nomics conference   confab of several hundred A-list corporate executives and several dozen green-strategy headliners  there was  Moment 


-  Which means ,  he was implying ,  that if you think his climate goals are too high ,  its only\nbecause your notion of whats possible is underdeveloped 


-  But now it was question time ,  and first there was   ( self-identified )  scientist who questioned all Gores science; Gore effortlessly backhanded him by citing 3 , 000 scientists of his own 


-  It seems to me youre probably the most well-known person arguing that we should be spending  large sum of our money ,  and we should be spending most of our concern ,  on cutting carbon emissions ,  and cutting very very soon 


-  ,  He continued ,  I would argue that the Copenhagen Consensus ,  and  lot of well-esteemed Nobel laureates ,  tell us that scientifically and economically its not  very good way to spend our money 


-  So my point is to say ,  should we have that debate?  know youve sort of dodged that bullet before ,  and  dont mean to corner you 


-  Do you want to have  debate on that? Would you be willing to have  debate with me on that point? ,  Eyes swung from Lomborg to Gore  for whom this could hardly qualify as being cornered 


-  ,  Gore then proceeded to liken questioners of Lomborgs ilk to the tobacco industry rejecting the surgeon generals report and claiming that cigarettes werent all that bad for you ,  after all  and millions and millions of people died as  result 


-  ,  To several of us looking on ,  this analogy seemed  little hard on Lomborg ,  but maybe Gore wouldnt agree  and in any case Lomborg wouldnt be getting any chance for rebuttal 


-  ( Gores answer to Lomborgs request was plenty clear enough 


-  Lomborg: Wanna debate this? Gore: Um ,  no 


-  )  ,  We have long since passed the time when we as  civilization ,  Gore said ,  let alone we as the United States of America ,  should pretend that this is an on-the-one-hand ,  on-the-other-hand kind of situation 


-  ,  ( Now building momentum for his close )  Its really kind of silly ,  for those of us in this generation ,  to look at those coming after us ,  and figure out what were going to say to them if the North Pole ice cap goes away 


-  The Maldives had  new line item in their budget this year 


-  ,  And the punchline: It was listed as fund to buy  new country 


-  ,  At least two things are interesting about the Gore-Lomborg exchange  not to mention the ECO:nomics exploration as  whole ,  which was at every turn both smart and serious ,  if often puzzling 


-  Which was not the only time at the conference when all the ambiguous forecasts ,  authoritative but contradictory policy plans and certain predictions of uncertainty bred bewilderment 


-  No one could agree on anything 


-  It sometimes felt like screenwriter William Goldmans Hollywood ,  where nobody knows anything but everybody would have to go back home and run  business anyway 


-  ,  The second thing is how Gore-Lomborg epitomized another characteristic of not just ECO:nomics but most of the public discussion about sustainability and business: Its nearly always  policy makers debate ,  with managers left to fend for themselves 


-  If youre  business executive ,  its probably not 


-  The lowest return: efforts to immediately cut carbon emissions  ( $0 


-   global warming strategy was ranked second ,  garnering  nearly identical 30% of votes ,  but it wasnt the emissions-reduction approach that Gore and so many others advocate 


-  cap-and-trade ,  or how high to push the price of gasoline or whether to substitute natural gas for oil and build an auto transportation system that could run on it  ( the widely publicized pitch by executive  


-  Almost always the theme was energy  how to change its source  ( can renewables succeed? )  or how to use it more efficiently 


-  ,  And as policy making goes ,  these are seminal questions 


-  ( And the focus on them wasnt entirely unexpected 


-  )  ,  But it was hard to escape the notion ,  during coffee-break chats and in the taxi rank with our rollaways packed to leave ,  that from  managers perspective there might have been  utility problem here 


-  ,  Of course ,  thats  gross oversimplification; no one expects to return from  conference with definitive operating instructions in hand 


-  In many ways ,  wed all better get used to being confused 


-  ,  Neither is the point here to undervalue the kinds of essential policy discussions being held in the press and at official meetings all over  ( and that were conducted especially well at ECO:nomics )  


-  ,  What were interested in at the MIT Sloan Management Review is not sustainability policy alone but its deceptively widespread management implications 


-  Our inquiry: Define and explore how the growing imperative for sustainable business practices will transform managerial decision making and strategy ,  how that imperative will require new organizational structures and ways of working ,  how it will reshape the organizations of the future  and how it will present leaders with new kinds of choices ,  whether they want to confront them or not 


-  To figure out ,  from  managers perspective ,  what to do 


-  ,  The invitation: As this issue goes to press ,  were launching  global survey about sustainability and its strategic management implications ,  and we hope youll join us by taking it and sharing your views  ( if you havent done so already )  


- edu/links/ and youll find  link to the survey along with other links related to this article 


-  Those interviews and now the survey itself aim to explore everything from how executives define sustainability to which sustainability-related issues will be drivers of competitive strategy to what sustainability-related opportunities and threats managers foresee  ( as well as what impediments they encounter when trying to address them )  


-  In other words ,  what will the new ,  sustainability-altered competitive landscape look like? And finally ,  what will businesses have to become in order to succeed in it? What new capabilities and characteristics will leaders have to cultivate in their organizations? In the emerging sustainability economy ,  what will businesses have to be good at in order to thrive? ,  In Thriving in the Sustainability Economy ,  you can see some preliminary answers to that last question ,  along with snippets of comment from the interviewees and follow-on questions that the preliminary answers prompted 


-  ,  The findings from all of the interviews ,  along with the results of the current survey ,  will be explored and interpreted in depth in the months to come  in the Review ,  at sloanreview
