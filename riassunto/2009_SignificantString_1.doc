-  ,  The good news is that ,  thanks to the Internet and other information technologies ,  we now have access to more data  sometimes much more data  about customers ,  employees and other stakeholders so that ,  in principle ,  we can gain  more accurate and intimate understanding of our environment 


-  But thats not enough; decisions still need to be made 


-  What if ,  though ,  we relied more on others to find those solutions? ,  To be sure ,  companies have long used teams to solve problems ,  focus groups to explore customer needs ,  consumer surveys to understand the market and annual meetings to listen to shareholders 


-  But the words solve ,  explore ,  understand and listen have now taken on  whole new meaning 


-  ,  But the proliferation of such technologies necessitates  framework for understanding what type of collective intelligence is possible  ( or not )  ,  desirable  ( or not )  and affordable  ( or not )   and under what conditions 


-  ,  Whether the goal is solution generation ,  evaluation or both ,  companies should consider three general types of approach to accomplish their objective: outreach ,  additive aggregation and self-organization 


-  Outreach When collecting ideas  ( generation )  or assessing them  ( evaluation )  ,   company might want to tap into people or groups that havent traditionally been included 


-  It might ,  for instance ,  want to reach across hierarchical or functional barriers inside the organization ,  or it could even desire to obtain help from the outside 


-  Both are needed in varying degrees ,  depending on the application 


-   number of those tasks have been successful ,  but the internal market tends to perform poorly when asked questions about the competition ,  which is apparently  topic about which Best Buy employees have limited knowledge 


-  Groupthink is but one example of the downside of self-organization 


-  At  minimum ,  managers need to consider the following important issues 


-  One is ,  simply ,  unwanted and undesirable outcomes  the collective makes  decision that could harm the company ,  revealing either  flaw in managers thinking or the improper application of collective intelligence 


-   third is unassigned liability  who is responsible for  poor decision made collectively? Moreover ,  companies need to be aware of the potential for snowball effects 


-  Through self-\norganization ,  an opinion might gain nonlinear momentum through self-amplification 


-  Not only will you be disclosing information about your organization to the external world ,  youll also be providing  forum for outsiders who might not always have your best interests at heart 


-  Another factor to consider is the actual composition of diversity: In the same way that sampling biases exist in polls ,  the diversity of  large population can also be skewed ,  leading to distorted decisions 


-  Thus ,  organizations need to decide which people to involve based on the ability of those individuals to understand the problem at hand and collectively make positive contributions to solving it 


- 10 Unfortunately ,  the season was  disaster ,  ending with PK-35 firing its coach and scrapping its fan-driven decision-making ways 


-  The lesson here is that many applications do require  large number of participants to ensure the quality of the output ,  but those individuals must still have the necessary knowledge to make useful contributions 


-  Incentives such as cash rewards ,  prizes and other promotions can be effective in stimulating individuals to participate in activities like prediction markets ,  for which explicit rewards seem to matter greatly 


-  With other applications  for example ,  submitting T-shirt designs to the Threadless Web site  cash rewards seem to matter less than recognition 


-  As the open-source movement ,  Wikipedia and other similar efforts have shown ,  participation in  community ,  the desire to transfer knowledge or share experiences ,  and  sense of civic duty can be powerful motivators 


-  Thus ,  organizations must provide  continuous flow of new ,  enthusiastic participants to keep engagement high ,  or they need to provide incentives to sustain peoples motivation over time 


-  The most obvious is that  company needs to disclose information about its problems to get others to think about them ,  and adjusting to and managing such transparency can be very difficult for many businesses ,  particularly those that have kept close wraps on their intellectual property 


-  Second ,  when  company seeks ideas from outside the organization ,  it needs to determine whether and how it will assume ownership of the resulting intellectual property 


-  ( It also needs to ensure that the intellectual property is the participants to give 


-  ,  Another basic question regarding mechanism design is whether to utilize distributed versus decentralized decision making 


-  Say someone uploads carbon-dioxide data for  particular geographic area and someone else uploads housing development information for that same neighborhood ,   third person could then study those two sets of data to investigate whether they were correlated 


-  For such situations ,  the organization can aid the decision-making process by effectively becoming  broker of information 


-  As  result ,  some organizations have decided to replicate an application exactly 


-  applications for  variety of purposes ,  including research and development ,  market research ,  customer service and knowledge management 


-  In such cases ,  managers should consider using key indicators to serve as proxies to assess an application before  final evaluation can be made 


-  Participants expect to be treated in  certain way and ,  more often than not ,  they also want the organizers of the application to be engaged as well 


-  applications has been less than optimal for  number of reasons 


-  Wikipedia might be the most well-known example of that ,  but there are many others 


-  ,  But  pressing question remains: Does collective intelligence really correct for decision biases? There is no simple answer 


-  elections ,  the Intrade Web site correctly predicted that the Democrats would gain control over both houses of Congress  something many political pundits and expert prognosticators had failed to foresee 


-  In  number of other documented cases ,  the collective decision-making process was shown to be biased 


-  Although  have come to appreciate the degree to which people want to express themselves ,  the quality of Wikipedia  ( and of many of its offspring )  is still surprising 


-  Today ,  with the one notable exception of prediction markets  ( for which  large body of work helps us understand what works and why )  ,  practice is still far ahead of theory in the field of collective intelligence 


-  ,  But the fact that we cant explain the success of many Decisions  


-  In fact ,  we use many tools on  daily basis that we dont fully understand  our intuitive minds ,  for example 


-  Research Division ,  to understand the dynamics of successful applications like Digg and Wikipedia 


-  Companies should consider deploying such feedback loops with greater frequency because the iterative process taps more fully into the power of  collective 


-  ,  But  growing number of applications have shown that  group of diverse ,  independent and reasonably informed people might outperform even the best individual estimate or decision 


- 14 At the very least ,  the emergence of Web-based tools for bringing people together in  variety of formats has made it possible to experiment with  number of different mechanisms for tapping into the decision-making capabilities of the collective 


-  application would do well to understand some fundamental issues ,  such as the balance between diversity and expertise ,  and the distinction between decentralized and distributed decision making 


-  After all ,  without such basic knowledge ,   business could easily end up tapping into  crowds madness  and not its wisdom
