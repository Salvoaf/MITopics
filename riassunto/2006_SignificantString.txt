- The story of the IKEA Group ,  the worlds largest furniture retailer ,  is well known 


-  This highly successful company ,  based in lmhult ,  Sweden ,  operates 220 stores in 33 countries and has annual sales of 14 


-  It has emerged as  global player in one of the most fragmented industries in the world 


-  IKEA has been studied and used as an example by prominent business authors such as Michael Porter ,  Gary Hamel and Philip Kotler 


-  ,  In general ,  IKEAs success is attributed to the fact that the company has redefined  number of organizational practices in the furniture business 


-  Its use of global product sourcing and customer self-service results in low costs 


-  IKEA has  tendency to choose the cheapest suppliers ,  and customers pick up ,  transport and assemble most furniture purchases from IKEA themselves 


-   portion of IKEAs savings from low-cost components and customer self-service is then passed on to customers in the form of low prices 


-  In addition ,  well-designed furniture and an unusual shopping experience result in consumers perceiving that they receive superior value for money spent 


-  Although IKEAs products are simple ,  most of them benefit from high-quality Scandinavian design 


-  IKEAs huge stores provide plenty of amenities as well ,  such as coffee shops ,  restaurants and even child-care facilities 


-  ,  Although much has been written about IKEA ,  one topic has remained virtually unexplored 


-  How did IKEAs revolutionary strategy come about? While it is important for managers to study the content of successful strategies ,  it may be even more important to understand the process through which they are created 


-  An in-depth examination of the history of IKEA ,  which was founded in 1943 ,  reveals that many specifics of the companys strategy were not brought about through  process of deliberate formulation followed by implementation 


-  IKEAs specific strategy then emerged as he both proactively developed  viable course of action and reactively adapted to unfolding circumstances 


-  ,  In the academic literature ,  this approach is known as logical incrementalism 


-  According to the logical incrementalism perspective ,  actual strategic management practices have little resemblance to the rational and analytic approach to strategic planning that is frequently advocated 


-  In the real world ,  the processes used by managers to craft  strategy are often fragmented ,  evolutionary and largely intuitive 


-  However ,  proceeding incrementally  ( instead of trying to plan everything out in advance and then trying to implement this plan )  is not sufficient 


-   general sense of direction is also necessary to guide the organization and its employees 


-  Kamprad wrote them down in  company publication titled Testament of  Furniture Dealer 


-  The essence of IKEAs strategy ,  he wrote ,  consists of offering  wide range of well-designed ,  functional home furnishing products at prices that are so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them 


-  ,  Interestingly ,  the initial decision to sell furniture was an adaptation to the market rather than  more deliberate strategy 


-  In the late 1940s ,  IKEA was  mail-order company that sold  variety of consumer items such as Christmas cards ,  seeds ,  fountain pens ,  wallets and picture frames 


-  Kamprad introduced the first piece of furniture in his mail-order catalog to imitate  successful competitor 


-  It is only because that initial piece of furniture was  huge success that he decided to focus on furniture and ended up discontinuing all other products  few years later 


-  ,  Similarly ,  many of the other major strategic decisions Kamprad made were incremental moves that grew out of experimentation rather than out of  preplanned strategy 


-  For example ,  IKEA owes much of its success to furniture that customers assemble and to flat packages that can easily be stacked in  warehouse or carried in  car 


-  Indeed ,  IKEA could never achieve such  low-cost position if customers did not agree to take on some of the tasks usually performed by manufacturers and retailers ,  such as delivering furniture to their homes and assembling it 


-  ,  It was Gillis Lundgren ,  one of IKEAs first employees ,  who came up with the concept of ready-to-assemble furniture kits in 1953 


-  However ,  it would be wrong to assume that Lundgren envisioned  new division of labor among customers ,  manufacturers and retailers the first time he took the legs off  table 


-  At that time ,  IKEA was  mail-order company ,  and insurance companies were complaining that  high percentage of its furniture was damaged while being shipped to customers 


-  Hence ,  selling unassembled furniture that could be packed and shipped in flat boxes was  way both to reduce the damages that occurred during delivery and to lower shipping costs 


-  It was only when IKEA began opening stores that the potential of customer-assembled furniture and flat packages was fully tapped 


-  It turned out that customers could create value for themselves by taking on the delivery and the assembly of the furniture they bought 


-  ,  Another key driver of IKEAs low-cost structure is global sourcing of products 


-  IKEA currently works with  , 300 suppliers in 53 countries ,  but Kamprad made the pioneering decision to source furniture from communist Poland as early as 1961 


-  Since manufacturing costs were 50% lower in Poland than in Sweden ,  his decision looks brilliant in hindsight 


-  However ,  that decision ,  too ,  was an adaptation to market circumstances rather than an outgrowth of  formal strategic planning process 


-  ,  In the 1950s ,  Swedish furniture retailers and manufacturers had an agreement to keep prices high 


-  Because IKEAs strategy consisted of selling furniture at considerably lower prices than its competitors ,  the Swedish retail cartel gave local furniture manufacturers an ultimatum: Retailers would no longer buy from manufacturers that sold to IKEA 


-  Most manufacturers didnt dare defy the retail cartel and so refused to do business with IKEA 


-  Thus ,  looking for suppliers outside Sweden was the only way for Kamprad to overcome  boycott that could have led IKEA to bankruptcy 


-  At that time ,  doing business with communist countries was unusual 


-  However ,  IKEAs long-term contracts for large volumes at low prices happened to match perfectly the way the Polish furniture export organization ,  PAGED ,  worked at the time 


-  ,  Furniture design is another key element of IKEAs success ,  and it ,  too ,  evolved in response to external pressures 


-  Before requesting local manufacturers to boycott IKEA in the late 1950s ,  the Swedish retail cartel had asked them not to sell the same furniture to IKEA as to its competitors 


-  The aim of the retail cartel was to make it harder for customers to compare prices 


-  At that time ,  designing furniture at IKEA essentially consisted of slightly modifying existing models to help suppliers avoid the retail cartels boycott 


-  In retrospect ,  however ,  the decision to perform design in-house was one of the best moves ever made by IKEA 


-  First ,  Scandinavian design helps differentiate the companys merchandise 


-  Second ,  IKEAs furniture design style is also instrumental in keeping costs and prices low ,  in part because it is adapted to automated manufacturing 


-  ,  Even IKEAs unique retail environment is in many ways the result of experimentation 


-  Most of what constitutes  typical IKEA store emerged as an aggregation of successful innovations made around the world 


-  For instance ,  the origin of the companys in-store restaurants can be traced back to the coffee and buns that Kamprad promised to visitors if they came to the opening of the companys first store in lmhult ,  Sweden ,  in 1953 


-  At the time ,  Kamprad feared that people would be reluctant to travel to lmhult ,   remote Swedish city ,  and so he used coffee and buns as an incentive 


-  ,  In many cases ,  store managers were forced to innovate by events over which they had no control 


-  For instance ,  when the first large IKEA store opened in Stockholm on June 18 ,  1965 ,  there were so many customers that the warehouse could not handle them 


-  This shopping frenzy could partly be attributed to the fact that the Swedish government planned to introduce  value-added tax in July 1965 


-  In order to cope with the rush of customers eager to make purchases before the value-added tax took effect ,  the store manager decided to let customers pick up their purchases from the warehouse 


-  At the time ,  opening the warehouse to customers was totally unheard of 


-  The result was so successful that all future IKEA warehouses were designed to allow for customer self-service 


-  ,  Finally ,  it is worth noting that even the decision to open stores in the first place was the result of experimentation 


-  Until 1953 ,  IKEA was  mail-order business 


-  However ,  cutthroat competition in the Swedish mail-order industry was driving prices down ,  and some competitors were skimping on quality to increase their margins 


-  As  result ,  the image of the entire mail-order industry was being damaged 


-  Together with Sven Gte ,  an early IKEA employee ,  Kamprad came up with the concept of  showroom 


-  The idea was to provide customers with an opportunity to see the products before ordering them through the mail 


-  ,  Several useful insights can be gained from the story of how IKEAs strategy evolved 


-  Specifically ,  understanding the process of strategy formation at IKEA offers four important lessons about how  revolutionary strategy can be developed using an incremental approach 


-  ,  Most successful strategies are based on  clear vision 


-  Today ,  Kamprads vision of offering  wide range of well-designed ,  functional home furnishing products at prices that are so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them guides the way IKEA furniture is designed ,  manufactured and sold 


-  ,  While it is important to have  sense of direction from the outset ,  an incremental approach may also be used to improve  vision over time 


-  ,  While  clear ,  overarching vision is necessary ,  success largely depends on the specifics of the strategy 


-  In the case of IKEA ,  the vision of offering well-designed furniture at prices much lower than competitors was innovative 


-  However ,   small Swedish company would never have become the worlds largest furniture retailer if Kamprad and his team had not also come up with new ways of designing ,  manufacturing and selling furniture 


-  ,  As we have seen ,  many of the specifics of IKEAs strategy emerged through  process of trial and error 


-  Kamprad tested  large number of different approaches on  small scale 


-  If an approach did not work ,  he refrained from using it again 


-  For instance ,  more than 90% of the products sold by IKEA are currently sourced from outside suppliers 


- 11 ,  The decision not to be more involved in manufacturing was actually made in the 1960s 


-  At that time ,  IKEA owned  television manufacturer 


- 12 ,  When using  trial-and-error process to craft  strategy ,  it is crucial to develop  corporate culture that allows people to make mistakes 


- 13 ,  Importantly ,  some of IKEAs most groundbreaking ideas emerged when the company faced difficult challenges 


-  For instance ,  sourcing furniture from communist Poland at the height of the Cold War was  bold move ,  but it is highly unlikely that Kamprad would have made such  risky decision if Swedish furniture manufacturers had not boycotted his company 


-  ,  In the history of IKEA ,  there are many other examples of problems turned into opportunities 


-  For example ,   fire destroyed IKEAs flagship store in Stockholm on September  ,  1970 


-  The store was rebuilt with the concept of self-service ,  using all the experience gathered over the previous five years 


-  In fact ,  in its early years ,  IKEA so often had its back to the wall that considering threats as potential opportunities became  key element of the companys corporate culture 


-  As Kamprad puts it: In IKEAs business philosophy ,  the whole matter should be transcribed as  golden rule: Regard every problem as  possibility 


- 14 ,  Many people think that coming up with  new concept is  prerequisite for developing  revolutionary strategy 


-  For example ,  as noted earlier ,  selling ready-to-assemble furniture is  cornerstone of IKEAs strategy 


-  It was his employee ,  Gillis Lundgren ,  who had the idea of taking the legs off  table and putting them under the tabletop 


-  At least one other Swedish company used to sell furniture kits before IKEA introduced them in its mail-order catalog 


-  However ,  according to Kamprad ,  managers from the other company failed to recognize the potential of their new concept 


- 15 ,  The IKEA case provides  unique opportunity to shed light on an underexplored topic: How are revolutionary strategies created? While this question is fundamental ,  there are surprisingly few answers in the academic and managerial literatures 


-  The story of IKEA suggests that even revolutionary strategies such as the one crafted by Kamprad can be traced back to  variety of small actions and decisions that were often made serendipitously and in response to external circumstances 


-  ,  This approach is common in entrepreneurial companies 


-  Entrepreneurs are ,  in essence ,  individuals with  vision that is not always fully articulated but that serves as an inspiration and guiding idea 


-  However ,  an experimental and incremental approach to strategy formation can also be useful for established corporations 


-  No matter the age or size of  company ,  there is  tension in strategy formation between the desire to shape the future and the need to adapt to an unfolding reality 


-  Logical incrementalism is  very useful conceptual tool for reconciling these two conflicting needs 


- When the weather is hot ,  7-Eleven Japans stores in Tokyo have plenty of bento boxes Japans cold boxed meals of rice ,  pickles and other foodstuffs  while on cold days there are lots of hot noodles for sale 


-  The stores operators always seem to have plenty of what their customers want; in fact ,  they order and receive fresh food deliveries three times  day 


-  It is no coincidence that the company is the nations most profitable retailer 


-  At least twice  week ,  every one of its 10 , 000-plus mostly franchised stores gets  visit from  7- Eleven Japan counselor 


-  The counselor works with the store manager or franchisee to improve the business ,  often by using data from the stores information systems to manage and order more effectively 


-  ,  By matching local practices and preferences to IT investments ,  the store can continually introduce and succeed with new product lines 


-  The typical store adds 70% new items for sale each year ,   higher rate than that of any other retailer in Japan ,  which helped double its average stores daily sales from 1977 to 2004 


-  The store managers regularly receive graphical data showing recent sales ,  weather conditions and product range information ,  so they always know just how many bento boxes to order 


-  ,  7-Eleven Japan makes effective IT investments and manages an IT portfolio that constantly matches its business strategy 


-  But the companys well-managed IT investments are only part of the story behind its 20-year track record of industry-leading financial returns 


-  The convenience-store giant blends its IT investments with  range of assertive IT practices and capabilities everything from the counselors visits that increase the store operators IT skills to the transparency of an information infrastructure that links 70 , 000 computers in stores ,  at headquarters and at supplier sites 


-  ,   primary objective of this article is to show that IT investments alone ,  even using the much-heralded IT portfolio approach ,  cannot by themselves ensure that all key business goals are met 


-  )  For example ,  for each dollar invested in IT infrastructure ,  companies with high IT savvy have higher net profits in the year after the investment than does the average company 


-  Those with low IT savvy have ,  on the other hand ,  substantially lower net profits in the following year  ( controlling for many other factors )  


-  But in our work at MITs Center for Information Systems Research ,  we have developed  definition that describes the core attributes while preserving the street smarts sense of the term 


-  To us  and in conversation with the business executives with whom we work regularly  IT savvy refers to the planned ,  ongoing use of  set of interlocking business practices and competencies that collectively derive superior value from IT investments 


-  For companies like 7-Eleven Japan ,  IT savvy is ingrained ,  informing almost all of the companys business decisions and sharply focusing its IT investments 


-  The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of IT savvy in order to reframe the discussion about the business value of IT 


-  ,  Just as investors address their objectives for risk and return using portfolios of financial investments ,  some companies use IT portfolio management to better enable their management teams to match IT investments to strategic objectives 


-  Successful IT portfolio techniques change the conversation from technical to strategic considerations by applying  commercial lens to IT investments; the result is an allocation of IT assets that is appropriate for the companys circumstances 


-  Transactional investments are used primarily to cut costs or increase throughput for the same cost  ( for example ,  think of  brokerage firms trade processing system )  


-  Strategic investments are used to gain competitive advantage by supporting entry into new markets or by helping to develop new products ,  services or business processes  ( ATMs were  successful strategic IT initiative for the first banks that introduced them but they became transactional over time )  


-  And infrastructure investments are the shared IT services used by multiple applications  ( such as ,  servers ,  networks ,  laptops ,  customer databases )  


-  Depending on the service ,  infrastructure investments are typically aimed at providing  flexible base for future business initiatives or reducing long-term IT costs via consolidation 


-  In the same way that any personal investment portfolio must weigh stocks ,  bonds ,  cash and other financial assets against personal goals ,  an IT portfolio must be balanced  and regularly rebalanced  so that it is constantly aligned with business strategy and provides the appropriate combination of short- and long-term payoff 


-  It is senior managements job to balance the IT portfolio ,  and to integrate these disciplines into the companys IT governance processes 


-  ,  The average company studied in 2005 allocates 46% of its total IT investment to infrastructure 


-  Conceptually ,  informational and strategic systems sit on top of and use the transactional and infrastructure systems ,  absorbing 17% and 11% of average IT investment ,  respectively 


-  For example ,  the executives of  multibillion-dollar  


-  software and IT services company allocated  recent multimillion-dollar investment in  customer relationship management system this way: 60% informational ,  5% strategic ,  25% transactional and 10% infrastructure 


-  As  relatively late adopter of CRM ,  the IT services company expected few strategic benefits from the investment 


-  By contrast ,   competitor had successfully implemented CRM three years earlier with  higher total project cost and  different allocation of resources more strategic and less informational 


-  ,  Pharmaceuticals leader Eli Lilly and Company has used the portfolio approach since 1999 to categorize its IT investments 


-  We tend to want to have 5% [of our projects] in strategic areas ,  15% to 20% in the informational category ,  and the remaining percentage split between the infrastructure and transactional ,  explains Sheldon Ort ,  Lillys information officer for business operations 


-  ,  The technique is also engaging business leaders in IT investment decisions at Mohegan Sun ,  the Connecticut-based casino 


-  CIO Dan Garrow reflects on the experience: Comparing our strategy against our plans for expenditures in each of the four management objectives for investments ,  we realized there was  disconnect between our long-range plans and our resource allocations ,  both human and financial 


-  Portfolio thinking helped us bring the day-to-day activities back into alignment with our long-range objectives 


-  Portfolio thinking helps us determine what type of company we are and the level of risk were willing to take ,  particularly around our strategic business efforts 


-  ,  The portfolio allocation approach works because it underscores the importance of how organizations use technology instead of focusing on the technology itself 


-  Making  sensible asset allocation requires senior managers to be crystal clear about what they wish to achieve and about who will be held accountable  hardly the stuff of technical specifications 


-  ,  Each asset class is linked to different types of business value 


-  )  For example ,  companies that invest more heavily than their competitors in transactional IT have lower costs 


-  Transactional investments pay off by using IT to support or automate repetitive business processes 


-  offers  good example: The company uses IT effectively to cut business costs and increase productivity 


-  For instance ,  it provides free package tracking information on its Web site or integrated into its customers enterprise resource planning systems 


-  Before online tracking was offered ,  customer calls to the companys call center cost UPS about $2 each; sometimes there were two follow-on calls to locate the package ,  for  total of $6 for one inquiry 


-  Now each tracking request costs UPS only  few cents ,  even during the Christmas rush ,  when the company gets up to six million such requests  day 


-  For any company that is eager to use IT to cut costs and improve productivity ,  it makes sense to tilt its IT portfolio toward transactional investments 


-  For example ,  Van-guard 


-  Some are designed to cut costs through standardization and consolidation  data center consolidation ,  for instance 


-  Others reduce time to market for new business initiatives or provide  platform for delivering companywide initiatives such as  shared customer database for  single point of customer contact 


-  offers  good example of the value created by  shared IT infrastructure 


-  The $20 billion company is  leader in the marketing ,  hospitality and travel businesses; its most recognized brands include Radisson Hotels  Resorts ,   


-  Although the businesses are run autonomously ,  Carlson has captured cost savings and synergies with  world-class shared services capability ,  which won the 2004 International Productivity and Quality Councils award for the best mature shared services organization 


-  ,  Carlson Shared Services is set up to operate as  business ,  offering IT and financial services  ( with plans to offer more )  it is governed by  board comprising the CIOs and CFOs of the business units; and its IT organization provides 89 infrastructure services to Carlsons businesses 


-  The IT unit compares the prices of its services to those of external vendors ,  and outsources whenever  vendor can offer  better price or quality proposition than what internal IT resources can offer 


-  As  result ,  Carlsons business units use the shared IT services as much as possible ,  even though use is not mandatory 


-  ,  Although the top performers  ( defined as the top third in terms of industry-adjusted return on assets ,  net margins and revenue growth )  have IT portfolio allocations similar to the average companys ,  collectively they spend 4% more on IT as  percentage of net sales 


-  ,  But the differences within specific industries are striking 


-  For example ,  top performers in financial services spend 10% less on IT than the average financial firm but have portfolios more heavily weighted toward IT infrastructure 


-  ( In that sector ,  IT investment is so fundamental to business processes that IT systems are quite mature ,  with much of the advantage coming from higher efficiency in executing basic transactions and providing infrastructure to foster innovation 


-  )  By contrast ,  the top performers in wholesale ,  retail and transport sectors spend 11% more on IT than their average competitors and weight their portfolios more heavily toward informational assets ,  indicating that theres still competitive advantage in the effective use of information 


-  ,  Clearly ,  companies that link their IT investments to their business strategies are well-placed to outrun their competitors along desired performance dimensions 


-  Above-average management capabilities are also needed to achieve above-industry-average returns from those IT investments 


-  Our research assessed each companys relative IT savvy by cataloging companies practices ,  processes and capabilities 


-  )  ,  The returns from IT infrastructure  the largest IT asset class and often the most difficult to cost-justify in advance  strikingly illustrate the impact of IT savvy 


-  By contrast ,  companies with low IT savvy have ,  on average ,  $909 lower net profits the next year per dollar spent on infrastructure  controlling for industry ,  size and other investments such as research and development and advertising expenditures 


-  ,  IT infrastructure is the foundation of all IT investments ,  including the communications network ,  shared customer data ,  laptops ,  data centers and servers; it accounts for close to half of the average companys total IT spend 


-  High-IT-savvy companies turn these enabling investments into value much faster than do low-IT-savvy companies  in one year compared with three years or longer 


-  They achieve this premium by following particular practices more rigorously  for example ,  by ensuring that more of their business processes are digitized ,  and by more quickly designing and implementing changes to crucial business processes 


-  Thus ,  instead of having their infrastructure investments hit the bottom line only as acquisition costs ,  IT-savvy companies put them to work faster ,  registering improvement on the bottom line in the next year 


-  ,  Raytheon Company illustrates how IT infrastructure investments can deliver cost savings and provide  platform for business agility ,  and it shows how business processes and decision-making practices must change accordingly 


-  She explains that the practices guiding Raytheon to  standardized technology infrastructure after the mergers were just  first step in generating value from IT: ,  You will outgrow the governance model that makes you successful 


-  It took me  while to figure that out because we had developed  governance model that was so effective  everybody was so supportive of it 


-  It was  governance model that helped us consolidate and shape up the company 


-  Thats what we needed to do over the first three to four years of being the new company ,  because if you dont get the synergy of the merger ,  youre not going to come up for air ever 


-  ,  However ,  Rhoads found that ,  following Raytheons cost-cutting successes ,  the focus needed to shift to agility ,  to questions of how the company would grow and how IT enables that growth 


-  ,  High-IT-savvy companies also see higher performance associated with transactional IT investments used to automate repetitive transactions ,  cut costs and increase throughput 


-  Not only does Wall Street value such investments in high-IT-savvy companies ,  but also these companies have higher profits 


-  Interestingly ,  companies with more transactional IT investment also have more sales from new and modified products 


-  Paradoxically ,  in high-IT-savvy companies ,  process digitization enables innovative new products and services by freeing up managers to innovate on the platform of these digitized processes 


-  For example ,  Amazon 


-  ,  the quintessential IT-savvy company ,  can relatively easily try  new service such as tailored recommendations based on the consumers purchase history and on other customers reviews 


-  The new service requires only marginal investment on top of Amazons current digitized processes 


-  Better yet ,  the product can be offered to only  few target customers and the impact can be measured immediately 


-  ,  Strategic IT ,  with its objectives to create new business value or growth ,  is historically  high-risk ,  high-return asset class 


-  In such companies ,  business management involvement and  culture of IT use in business processes are necessary for more successful strategic  ( and in other companies ,  risky )  IT investment 


-  Companies with strong IT savvy demonstrate particularly strong profitability because of the disciplines required to use common sets of information effectively 


-  There is no impact from informational IT on innovation ,  cost or market capitalization in the average company 


-  The situation for these companies is bleak ,  with value leaking from most of their IT spending 


-  Otherwise ,  they will continue to leak value ,  particularly from the longer-term and higher-risk asset classes such as strategic IT 


-  ,  What are the hallmarks of the IT-savvy company? Companies with high IT savvy have developed the five mutually reinforcing characteristics described below 


-  The first three characteristics are practices related to IT use ,  and the last two are competencies needed for high IT savvy 


-  )  ,  IT for communication  extensive use of electronic channels such as e-mail ,  intranets and wireless devices for internal and external communications and work practices 


-  For example ,  7-Eleven Japans system connects 70 , 000 computers in stores ,  at headquarters and at supplier sites ,  providing transparency across the entire value chain 


-   salesman for one of the companys food suppliers put it this way: [Their] information system is so good that we can instantly find out which goods of ours are selling to what types of customers and how much 


-  The collaboration between 7-Eleven Japan and its partners includes shared information ,  information systems and know-how about operations management as well as quality control throughout the value chain 


-  ,  Internet use  more use of Internet architectures for key processes such as sales force management ,  employee performance measurement ,  training and post-sales customer support 


-  ,  Digital transactions   high degree of digitization of the companys repetitive transactions ,  particularly sales ,  customer interaction and purchasing 


-  The underpinning for 7-Eleven Japans digital capability is the network of 70 , 000 computers that collect data at the point of sale on every customer and every item sold 


-  Each days data is analyzed for use the next morning 


-  Other digitized processes allow each store to place orders and receive deliveries three times daily ,  with deliveries organized by temperature  frozen ,  refrigerated ,  ambient ,  etc 


-  ,  Companywide IT skills  the ability of almost all employees to use IT effectively 


-  There are strong technical and business skills among the IT staff ,  strong IT skills among the business staff and an adequate market supply of highly skilled IT staff 


-  7-Eleven Japan trains its 200 , 000 employees to use available point-of-sale data along with information on product ,  local weather forecasts and regional demographic and purchasing patterns so they can propose and quickly test hypotheses about the appeal of different types of products in each store 


-  ,  Constant management involvement  strong commitment of senior managers to effective IT use 


-  Business-unit managers are heavily involved in IT decisions ,  strengthening partnerships between IT staff and business units to help generate value from IT investments 


-  Putting it another way ,  the companies that focus on strengthening IT capabilities have developed the IT practices and companywide IT skills that complement investments in the four IT asset classes 


-  The strong commitment of senior management encourages more business-unit managers to become involved in IT decisions 


-  This in turn leads to more companywide IT skills via formal and informal education programs ,  along with more use of IT for communication ,  work practices and transaction digitization 


-  ,  The results of IT savvy are clearly observed when measuring process digitization 


-  On average ,  the 147 organizations we studied completed 19% of their sales and 23% of their purchases electronically; there was little variation across industries 


-  However ,  the third of companies with the most digitized processes completed 50% of their sales and 55% of their purchases electronically 


-  ,  Our research identifies the returns on different types of IT investments for the average company ,  and demonstrates that even higher returns are available by matching IT-savvy practices and competencies with the IT portfolio 


-  But how can managers work to match IT savvy with the IT asset mix? Here are seven suggestions based on the experiences of the top performers: ,  Using our portfolio categorization ,  estimate your companys IT portfolios for the last three years and the proposed IT portfolio for next year 


- 10 At an IT investment committee or governance meeting ,  discuss whether these investments are appropriate for the companys business strategy 


-   recent discussion with an insurance company ,  looking back over the last four years of IT portfolios ,  raised these important questions: ,  By answering these questions ,  the insurer reconsidered its IT investment process and began increasing the IT savvy of the whole organization  starting at the top 


-  ,  Using the results reported in this article and other benchmarks ,  assess whether your current IT portfolios are appropriate for your companys or business units strategic goals ,  IT savvy and appetite for risk 


-  An attractive alternative to using benchmarks is to compare multiple business units in your company 


-  Since each business unit has  different strategy and IT savvy ,  comparisons of the alignment of their objectives ,  practices ,  capabilities and IT portfolios will help highlight where IT investments are applied thoughtfully and what changes should be considered 


-  Again ,  its informative to compare IT savvy across multiple business units 


-  Companies or business units with low overall IT savvy should consider re-weighting their IT portfolios toward the less risky transactional and informational investments 


-  )  To improve IT savvy ,  start with characteristics that provide leverage for the most important asset classes in the companys or business units IT portfolio 


-  Practices from strong IT-savvy business units can be codified and transferred to those with less IT savvy 


-  ,  Using the results from the previous three steps ,  senior management must make judgments about the companys IT portfolio 


-  The judgments are based on managements intuition concerning strategy ,  appetite for risk ,  the companys IT savvy ,  the economy ,  available capital ,  etc 


-  Having an IT portfolio process makes this judgment explicit and trackable over time instead of hidden within the budgets of each project or department 


-  ,  Like personal investments ,  IT portfolios need to be re-weighted as business and economic circumstances change 


-  For example ,  as companies achieve high overall IT-savvy ratings ,  they can invest more in IT and assume more risk  ( such as increase strategic or infrastructure investments )  in their portfolios relative to competitors or to previous investments 


-  ,  Effective IT governance specifies the decision rights and accountability framework to ensure that IT is applied in the right ways 


-  IT investment is one of the key IT decisions that needs to be governed 


-  Effective governance institutionalizes the disciplines of IT investment  ( often incorporating IT portfolio management )  in  repeatable process that is understood and followed by all managers and linked to the companys incentive and reward systems 


-  The shorter the time lag ,  the greater the number of opportunities to learn 


-  Tracking the impact of IT investment decisions and using these results to inform the next cycle of IT investment promotes enterprise learning  the faster the better 


-  Growing numbers of companies now include in their project budgets an allocation for development of people that includes education ,  training and post-implementation reviews  ( or even in-process implementation reviews )  


-  They are not meant to be  step-by-step how-to for overhauling the IT strategies of large ,  complex organizations ,  nor are they meant to provide  new organization blueprint for the IT-savvy company 


-  ,  Clearly ,  there are myriad pressing issues clamoring for the attention of the top management team 


-  In our experience ,  companies with average or low IT savvy can significantly increase their returns and reduce their IT risk without investing another cent in technology 


-  That should be reason enough for many business leaders to elevate the issue 


-  ,  More fundamentally ,  though ,  the story of IT savvy is  story of untapped potential  of money left on the table ,  and of competitors who can grab  lasting advantage 


-  In  time of unrelenting competition from all corners of the globe ,  managers must understand the consequences of not acting to enrich their organizations IT savvy 


- When people hear the word services ,  they often think about offerings that are neutral or routine 


-  They conjure up familiar experiences that they navigate regularly  for example ,  dry cleaning ,  haircutting or lawn care 


-  Such services are distinct from the types of services people aspire to use ,  such as those associated with travel and entertainment; for classification purposes ,  these might be labeled positive services 


-  We refer to these as negative services because they deal with events most people hope they will never have to deal with  things such as toothaches ,  leaky roofs or collision repairs 


-  Whereas much of the writing about services has looked at the nature of the activity  ( for example ,  whether it is tangible or intangible )  or has examined the activity from the provider perspective  ( for example ,  in medicine ,  whether the need is acute or chronic )  ,  we take  customer viewpoint 


-  )  ,  Most people feel confident in describing common problems and the routine services they require 


-  But negative services are different: Customers are not able to evaluate the content of the service  only the process  ( and then only after the service has been completed )  


-  Because the precipitating events that trigger the need for negative services are not everyday occurrences ,  many people are not equipped to diagnose their needs or make informed judgments about the solutions required 


-  They may know that they have  toothache or  flooded basement ,  for example ,  but they dont know the right response 


-  Furthermore ,  even after the service has been provided ,  they usually are in  poor position to judge its quality or the price paid for it 


-  Nevertheless ,  there are many cases of unnecessary medical procedures and of consumers wondering if the repair parts they purchased were truly necessary 


-  However ,  in recent years ,  they have become more visible in other industry environments 


-  For example ,  Sears ,  Roebuck and Co 


-  ,  one of the worlds largest retailers of appliances ,  tools and machinery ,  has made negative services  profitable part of its business 


-  health care industry  concerned with diagnosing and treating illnesses and responding to accidents  falls into negative services 


-  So do the tens of thousands of businesses that specialize in repairing cars and unclogging drains 


-  Services shift from being negative to becoming routine when the problems are largely under control and can be managed by the recipients themselves ,  as in the case of people with diabetes 


-  ,  Companies hoping to build positions in negative services face two major challenges:  (  )  how to access inexperienced customers ,  who are not in  strong position to evaluate the service being provided and may have  poor idea of its cost ,  and  (  )  how to organize and deploy their services to meet customer needs when demand is unpredictable 


-  ,  Prospect theory in psychology offers  fresh perspective on how individuals view risks and losses in decision making 


-  It suggests that people are not rational about decisions when they are fearful 


-  They do not study the facts ,  select strategies or weigh the probable outcomes 


-  People in need of negative services approach decisions in  similar fashion 


-  Our investigation suggests that people go through at least three phases when receiving negative services: awareness and selection ,  connection and provision 


-  ,  Though people are conscious of negative services ,  they often deny that the services are intended for them 


-  Consequently ,  the services can be divided into two broad forms: pre-event ,  in which the service recipient acknowledges  probable service need  ( risk )  or has some institutional inducement to anticipate the need ,  and post-event ,  in which the recipient reacts with some urgency to problem signs or symptoms ,  although the specific nature of the problem may not be known 


-  ,  When choosing  pre-event contract ,  few service recipients take the time to understand the quality differences between potential service providers ,  or they may find evaluation difficult 


-  Pre-event contracts ,  often selected on the basis of cost or ease of access ,  frequently lock service recipients into specific provider relationships 


-  An auto insurance company ,  for example ,  may not mandate  specific body shop ,  but it may suggest one 


-  ,  In situations where no pre-event contracts exist and services needs arise  ( that is ,  post-event )  ,  service recipients often assess their service options based on the magnitude of the problem  ( in terms of cost or personal requirement )  and on the time they have available 


-  If the need is urgent ,  as in the case of an auto accident or  broken furnace during winter ,  people may take any port in  storm 


-  They know they need help ,  and ,  unfortunately ,  they are not in the best position to sift through all the possible solutions to determine how much each will cost 


-  ,  Once the need for negative services is evident ,  people often tap into  large network of service providers ,  whether they are aware of it or not 


-   single car accident ,  for example ,  typically triggers the involvement of  towing company ,  at least one insurance company ,  an appraiser ,   body shop and  car rental agency 


-  Some services act as connectors ,  even if the end users dont actively choose them 


-  For example ,  ambulance services play  big role in hospital selection 


-  motorist calls AAA to request road service ,  he or she has no idea which towing company will appear on the scene 


-  ,  In Europe ,  Multiasistencia Group ,   large home assistance and repair company ,  has grown by leveraging relationships with  number of financial institutions; it has no direct relationship with the end users of its services 


-  The Madrid-based company  ( which operates in Spain ,  France ,  the United Kingdom and Portugal )  offers its services through insurance companies ,  banks and other affiliates ,  all of which are trying to cultivate the loyalty of their own customers 


-  For example ,  one of Spains largest banks recently contracted with Multiasistencia to provide  new perk to its credit card holders: 24-hour plumbing and locksmith service 


-  Bank customers pay no charge for service calls ,  and labor costs are discounted substantially below local rates 


-  ,  Many service recipients tend to think in terms of  specific service provider   surgeon ,  mechanic or repair-person  as opposed to  service network 


-  But the work of an individual service provider is often difficult to isolate from all the related services that contribute to the overall experience 


-  Following an accident ,  for example ,  the service recipient  ( in this case ,  the patient )  may perceive that the principal service provider is the attending physician ,  but the ambulances emergency medical technician may be the one who actually saved the patients life 


-  Nonetheless ,  the principal service provider  ( in this case ,  the physician )  is usually in the strongest position to use the goodwill to support his or her growth strategy 


-  Indeed ,  its hard to name  chain of boiler repair specialists ,  body shops or dental offices 


-  Each of these industries has several factors favoring scale economies ,  so the increased level of concentration is not surprising 


-  For negative service providers ,  significant market fragmentation raises important questions about how to approach the market and how to manage the business to achieve the best possible results 


-  )  ,   number of companies have tried  with varying degrees of success  to make negative services  central part of their overall corporate strategies 


-  In the course of analyzing the changing market dynamics within service industries ,  we have identified four core strategies for negative services growth: market-centric ,  provider-centric ,  network management and network enhancement 


-  ,  Since most people have only an infrequent need for negative services ,  it is difficult for specialized service providers to establish and maintain links with customers 


-  In medicine ,  for example ,  it takes  wide network of primary care physicians to keep  narrow specialist busy 


-  Although the likelihood that any one patient will face  specific negative condition is small ,  many primary care physicians referring their cases to  small group of specialists can make for  growth opportunity 


-  ,  Insurance companies have strong market connections and play an organizing role; they provide  pre-event link between service recipients and specific providers 


-  While they influence customer choice ,  they do not provide the actual service 


-  Other companies ,  particularly those with broad market visibility ,  such as Sears ,  have been drawn to the idea of service business expansion ,  even if it is difficult to orchestrate 


-  ,  Sears already had  $3 billion home services business when it established Sears HomeCentral in 1996 


-  Managements goal was to capture an even bigger share of the fragmented home services market ,  which Sears estimated at nearly $160 billion  ( including $60 billion for interior home improvement ,  $50 billion for exterior home improvement ,  $30 billion for residential maintenance and $20 billion for product repair )  


-  ,  Claiming relationships with more than 70 million households and more than 15 million in-home visits per year ,  Sears targeted revenues of $10 billion in 2000 through  mixture of negative and routine services: roofing ,  siding ,  service contracts ,  heating and cooling ,  pest control and windows and doors 


-  Its strength was in time-sensitive household repairs ,  but it anticipated that much future growth would be in areas in which customers had time to research and compare alternatives ,  such as heating and air-conditioning systems 


-  ,  In creating the Sears HomeCentral brand ,  the company launched  major ad campaign to draw attention to its service focus 


-  It offered to repair any appliance ,  not just those purchased at Sears 


-  It invested heavily in training  force of 15 , 000 technicians  ( both employees and independent contractors )  and armed them with the latest technology 


-  To underline its new service focus ,  it acquired  large remodeling contractor and  termite and pest control company 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  the market didnt respond as quickly as management had hoped 


-  Although services were much more profitable than the companys mainstream business ,  using the Sears brand to expand into other businesses was  struggle 


-  The company has closed some of its stores and has chosen to eliminate some of its home services lines  ( such as pest control )  


-  Among other things ,  management learned that the infrastructure for  rapid response to appliance repairs is very different from whats needed to manage services such as deck and siding installation ,  which have longer time frames 


-  ,  Other companies attempting to pursue the market-centric model have had more success in attracting new customers 


-  The Terminix International Company ,   leader in residential pest control ,  based in Memphis ,  Tennessee ,  is  rare example of  company that offers  focused negative service 


-  Acquired in 1986 by The ServiceMaster Company ,   provider of industrial services in Downers Grove ,  Illinois ,  it spends heavily on advertising to establish itself as the homeowners first choice for pest control 


-  In essence ,  Terminix has two segments of customers: those who think they have  pest problem that needs attention  ( because of ,  say ,   rotting deck )  and those who want or need pest inspections when homes are being sold 


-  ,  Gaining  reputation for being the best at what it does or providing good value at low cost helps  negative service provider build its market position 


-  Providers looking to grow need to find ways to create the conditions for easy evaluation by prospective customers 


-  ,  To understand this approach ,  consider the example of the Shouldice Hospital in Thornhill ,  Ontario ,  Canada ,  which specializes in hernia operations 


-  Based on its reputation for postoperative success ,  the Shouldice draws patients from across Canada and the United States ,  despite the fact that its surgeons tend to follow procedures that are more invasive than other treatments 


-  Because it specializes ,  the Shouldice operates more efficiently than hospitals offering  broader range of treatments ,  with less capital and fewer support staff and supplies 


-  ,  In  sense ,  the Shouldice has found  way to move its service of hernia surgery from the negative to the routine 


-  The placement of their centers around the country allows users to travel from their home base and still maintain their treatments 


-  Service providers looking to distinguish themselves as specialists need to figure out how to provide customers with credible and accessible information to evaluate their services 


-  ,   fairly common network management strategy is to piggyback on the business of other companies in order to gain access to customers 


-  This is what Multiasistencia does in the area of home assistance and repair ,  and what credit card loss-protection companies have done by using mailing lists of bank customers 


-  Another company that has pursued this strategy successfully is American Home Shield Corp 


-  ,  AHS is the leading home services warranty specialist in the United States ,  selling warranties to cover repairs throughout homes: major appliances ,  heating and cooling systems ,  plumbing and electrical systems ,  even swimming pools 


-  Founded more than 30 years ago ,  it grew by insuring home buyers against property faults 


-  Rather than marketing warranties directly to customers ,  AHS co-markets pre-event service contracts through banks and mortgage companies that are much better known ,  including Bank of America ,  Chase ,  GE Capital and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage 


-  When problems occur ,  homeowners place calls to AHS ,  which dispatches the appropriate contractor 


-  ,  Network enhancers study negative service networks to see how they can improve the overall service delivery process 


-  They do not manage the whole process or provide the major service content to the end user 


-  Rather ,  they look for opportunities that other network partners will value for managing their customers and integrating the supply network through information systems 


-  ,  which has the largest car rental fleet in the United States ,  has been successful in using this approach 


-   relative latecomer to the car rental business ,  it differentiated itself from the start by placing most of its offices in neighborhood markets ,  rather than focusing on airports and other transportation centers 


-  To appeal to customers ,  one of Enterprises best-known features is providing free transportation to the rental office 


-  ,  Enterprise specializes in renting to customers who need  car because of an accident ,  mechanical repair or theft 


-  Enterprise also tries to make things easy for the insurance companies and auto repair shops by streamlining the reports and using information technology to the fullest extent 


- 10 From  customers view ,  the service is seamless 


-  It links auto body shops to insurance companies  providing service to both  and to the owner of the damaged vehicle 


-  In doing so ,  it attempts to create enough goodwill to generate customer loyalty 


-  ,  the Mountain View ,  California-based financial software company ,  follows  similar approach 


-  Even though tax preparation services are mostly routine ,  Intuits TurboTax product likewise simplified the process of tax preparation by linking the taxpayers employer ,  brokerage service ,  bank and payroll management company 


-  In these circumstances ,  service recipients must communicate directly with service providers regarding the diagnosis of the problem and do their best to understand which repairs are absolutely essential and which can wait 


-  Laidlaw ,  for example ,   diversified company based in Naperville ,  Illinois ,  concentrated on routine services  ( school and intercity buses )  but then diversified into new areas ,  including chemical waste management and ambulance services 


-  Laidlaw management soon realized that combining different kinds of activities was more difficult than it appeared ,  requiring vastly different marketing and management skills 


-  They often attempt to sell both routine and negative services to the same customers 


-  But negative service providers are selected based on the magnitude of the problem and the time available for response ,  whereas customers select routine service providers based on their specific needs and the providers perceived ability to meet them 


-  Some customers have contractual or preexisting relationships; other customers are decision influencers rather than recipients 


-  Different types of customers represent different levels of knowledge and ability to evaluate the services being provided 


-  Contrary to how it may seem ,  there is usually very little on the demand side to justify one-stop shopping 


-  ,  ITS EASY TO SEE why managers have such difficulty understanding negative services 


-  In the course of receiving the service ,  they often feel anxious 


-  And there is no getting around the reality that many negative services are difficult to evaluate before ,  during and after the fact 


-  ,  Although customers tend to be loyal to service providers once they have established relationships ,  the nature of negative services makes for peculiar challenges 


-  Ironically ,  making products more reliable can lead to new challenges: If there are fewer product failures in  given location ,  logistics support on  per unit basis may become more costly to provide 


-  As many manufacturers known for their service can attest ,  being an excellent service provider is not sufficient to build  sustainable service business; it also requires  steady stream of customers 


-  To be successful ,  service providers need to look at both supply and demand and devise flexible relationships on the supply side to meet the fluctuating needs of the market 


-  )  ,  Most of the successful companies we studied achieved sufficient volume and built customer loyalty by broadening the scope of their services 


-  But those who excel in negative services seem to have difficulty broadening beyond them ,  perhaps because meeting negative service needs requires  highly responsive system in which low cost is not the primary concern 


-  ,  Most negative service providers tend to focus on service delivery outcomes  for example ,  successful tooth implants or  perfect auto body paint job 


-  Service recipients ,  on the other hand ,  tend to view things more from  process perspective  how it felt to be the customer or patient and how smoothly the service was delivered 


-  Service providers need to recognize these differences in perspective and develop better ways to educate customers in evaluating their services and the customer service experience 


-  To be successful ,  they must have  deep understanding of the needs of customers and how best to address them
