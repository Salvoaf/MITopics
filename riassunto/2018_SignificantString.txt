- Late last fall ,  after  semester of classes ,   young ,  white ,  male MBA student came to me and said ,  So ,   now realize just how badly women still experience gender discrimination ,  and it makes me really angry 


-  But  have no idea how to stop it or what to do about it 


-  His words communicated  genuine desire to combat attitudes and treatment that for many women are all too familiar 


-  ,   would have been surprised by his comments had  not witnessed  similar reaction months earlier when interviewing seasoned executives who serve on the boards of large ,  publicly traded  


-  ,  In both practice and research ,  we are doing  better job at bringing attention to the problem 


-  But we havent established enough tangible suggestions for how to challenge it 


-  One idea Ive been exploring: Giving people clearer language to use in their day to day encounters with prejudice 


-  ,   have been examining the effect of gender composition on the decision-making processes of corporate boards ,  as part of  research project with my coauthors  Dr 


-  After interviewing  couple dozen female executives ,  it became clear to my coauthors and me that female directors consistently experienced distinct barriers in the boardroom when they were the only woman ,  or one of just  few women ,  on the team 


-  ,  When investigating this issue from the male point of view ,  we found  significant lack of awareness regarding these obstacles 


-  Impediments include women having difficulties with nomination onto boards because they didnt fit the typical mold  white ,  male ,  former CEO  or ,  once on the board ,  being excluded from decisions that happened on the golf course or in mens executive lounges  ( yes ,  bathrooms )  


-  ,  As we recounted these examples to our male interviewees ,  we witnessed disbelief ,  shock ,  and disappointment 


-  We saw real frustration at the realization that their female colleagues were routinely experiencing obstacles that they and their male colleagues were not 


-  ,  And again ,  we heard the sentiment ,  OK ,  this still exists and its worse than  thought it was 


-  What can  do about it?  want to help fix it 


-  ,  Of course ,  the fact that gender discrimination is alive and well should not be surprising ,  especially given the attention that the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements have given to sexual harassment in the last nine months 


-  However ,  in both practice and research ,  we have not moved past awareness of the issue to tangible recommendations on how to tackle it 


-  ,  One exception might be the recommendation that women seek out sponsors 


-  Sponsors go beyond mentors: Whereas mentorship involves providing advice and support ,  sponsorship involves advocating for  mentee and helping to position her for career-advancing opportunities 


-  Research shows that women are much less likely than men to receive active sponsorship ,  which some argue might be an especially fruitful pathway to career advancement 


-  ,  Mentorship and sponsorship ,  however ,  are strategies that take time to develop and enact effectively 


-  What happens when we hear or see discriminatory behavior actually happening? How do we respond in the moment to an off-color comment? Or to  male colleague exhibiting  common unconscious display of dominance by speaking just  little bit longer and louder and drowning out the voice of his female colleague? ,  What are the words that will call attention to the issue ,  without sacrificing work relationships? ,  In my research ,   have begun to investigate developing and testing the efficacy of what  call scripts 


-  There is currently no established set of scripts to address gender discrimination  that is ,   set of words or phrases that would signal to  peer that he has crossed  line ,  whether knowingly or unknowingly 


-   phrase as simple as: Can you repeat what you just said? when  biased remark is uttered or said as  joke can be  straightforward way to make someone aware that theyve said something out of bounds 


-   response like ,  Thats not cool ,  or That comment doesnt reflect the person  know you to be can bring  shot of level-headed interruption to an interaction ,  prompting the speaker to reconsider his perspective 


-  They allow us to plan ,  in more deliberate ways ,  on how to push back respectfully and effectively 


-  To be clear ,  lack of awareness is not an inherently male problem 


-  If women made up the majority in powerful ,  high-social-status positions and men comprised the minority in such positions ,  women would be likely to similarly fall into majority-favoring behavior that could become mostly automatic and unconscious 


-  Its how the human brain works  we prioritize what we are exposed to personally ,  and we have difficulty understanding the perspective of those who have different experiences than us 


-  ,  Another cognitive shortcoming that scripts could help address is the use of confirmation bias 


-  Humans make decisions about people based on previous experiences and beliefs ,  and because people are generally exposed to more male leaders than female leaders ,  males are generally associated more with leadership positions than are women 


-  But if men were to adopt scripts to disrupt this self-reinforcing cycle ,  more equal weight could be given to womens voices in decision-making processes ,  leading to greater visibility ,  endorsement ,  and ultimately ,  promotion 


-  Indeed ,  given the threat of backlash effects that women experience when speaking up in response to this situation ,  the role of male colleagues  especially at the peer level  in expressing this script is particularly powerful 


-  ,  In the workplace ,  in schools ,  and in society in general ,  biased comments and everyday power plays may seem small individually ,  but they are cumulatively significant 


-  ,  Men ,  by virtue of their majority position ,  have  unique opportunity to directly combat gender discrimination 


-  Women can also contribute by responding with ideas and feedback in support of their male colleagues attempts to right the process 


-  Learning how to develop and enact scripts to disengage from the automaticity of our everyday interactions is ultimately  collaborative effort 


- When German car manufacturer Volkswagen was caught cheating on its diesel emissions testing regime  few years ago ,  the subsequent scandal launched numerous lawsuits ,  cost billions of dollars in fines ,  and severely harmed the companys reputation 


-  The actions  and inaction  of dozens of employees at all levels ,  across divisions and countries ,  contributed to this disaster ,  including the software engineers who designed the cheating device ,  the workers who installed it ,  the managers who approved the fitting and testing ,  and the members of the senior leadership team who either orchestrated the scam or simply turned  blind eye 


-  ,  Of course ,  VW isnt an isolated example 


-  Why do such scandals continue ,  despite the clear moral and financial imperatives for ethical action? And  perhaps more important  what can be done to change matters? ,  Although some argue that people are innately inclined to behave unethically out of self-interest ,  our research reveals that organizational ethics matter significantly to most employees and managers ,  and that people want to work for employers whose values and principles are aligned with their own 


-  Whats more ,  research has shown  link between ethical leadership and task performance ,  organizational citizenship ,  and other productive work behaviors6  companies have many compelling reasons to address ethical failings at the earliest opportunity 


-  organizations   national government department ,   nationwide retailer ,   nonprofit in the social services sector ,   county-level police force ,  and  construction company  to tell us about their experiences of both ethical and unethical practices on the part of their colleagues ,  line managers ,  and senior executives 


-  Over time ,   consistent mishandling of these micro-level issues can spiral into macro-level corporate scandal 


-  Here ,  we discuss several murky areas that employees must navigate and ways that organizations can help them make ethical choices day to day 


-  ( An ethically strong situation ,  in contrast ,  is one in which the right thing to do is clearly communicated to employees and people have the motivation and ability to behave in ways that are consistent with the organizations ethical code 


-  ,  Here are the daily dilemmas we found that tend to muddy the ethical waters for individuals in decisions both large and small 


-  Sometimes employees observe  gap between their personal ethics and those of the wider organization ,  and that makes them uneasy 


-  An abundance of studies show that people want to fit in at work9  but its not just  fit with the requirements of the job or even  fit with the organizations culture that matters 


-  New research is beginning to show that people have  strong desire to gain  sense of moral fit as well 


-  When they struggle to do so ,  they often withdraw and may quit their jobs altogether 


-  This sentiment is echoed by many 


-  Every organization has  range of stakeholders affected by its decisions ,  including employees ,  suppliers ,  clients ,  senior managers ,  the local community ,  wider society ,  and even the environment 


- 11 Organizations may have an explicit approach to balancing these competing needs  but that may not be the same as the implicit approach that employees witness every day 


-  ,  When we asked employees and their leaders to rank the order in which stakeholders matter in important decisions ,  consensus was rare 


-  As one employee in the retail sector said ,  Even though weve got  vision and weve got an ethical policy framework ,   personally feel very strongly that [in practice] its shareholder ,  company ,  colleague ,  in that order 


-  One manager told us ,  Sometimes ,  the choices we have to make are not overtly compromising ,  but they can make things difficult  people asking for access to services when theyre not entitled to them ,  or people jumping the queue 


-  Even different departments within the same organization face competing priorities when having to choose between stakeholder groups 


-  However ,  each time an employee or  leader makes  decision that implicitly or explicitly favors one stakeholder group over another ,  it sends  message to other employees about what really matters  and whose interests the organization is willing to sacrifice 


-  Witnessing unethical conduct by  colleague or superior forces people to decide: Do  take this further? If so ,  how? And what will be the consequences for me and for others? ,  Often ,  whether or not people challenge unethical behavior depends on the nature of the infraction ,  the setting within which it takes place ,  the seniority and roles of those involved ,  and the potential risks of challenging the behavior 


-  One government manager seemed to have realized this ,  saying ,  Im quite an outspoken person ,  and nobody has ever challenged my behavior ,  even though in some circumstances  recognize that  perhaps go  bit too far 


-  ,  Some employees we spoke with described instances when they chose to stay silent 


-  Discussing an event when bonuses were awarded to everyone except the hourly workers on the front line ,  one retail employee said: ,  And  junior police officer told us: ,  When employees choose to stay quiet  even with good intentions  alternate viewpoints are silenced ,  levels of engagement and commitment are likely to diminish , 12 and others note that failure to challenge is the norm 


-  ,  Conversely ,  in the construction company ,  an employee was comfortable publicly challenging  colleague for the use of sexist language; when the perpetrator apologized immediately ,  the interaction sent  positive message to others about how to handle such situations 


-  Another challenge is deciding what to do when the ethical solution to  problem is not the expedient solution  often because there arent enough hours ,  dollars ,  or people to make the ethical solution happen 


-  As one retail manager put it: ,  In the context of the police ,  this kind of problem meant that officers had to make choices about which crimes to investigate ,  causing a huge amount of strain and stress to officers because they cant do the job theyre trained to do ,  that theyre paid to do ,  that they want to do ,  and is the reason why they joined in the first place ,  according to  leading officer on the force 


-  Our research and analysis suggest that the following six steps can help leaders set an ethically strong tone so that employees are better equipped to make the right choices day to day 


-  This drives individuals to internalize their decision-making processes  which can create  slippery slope 


-  ,  In the police force we studied ,  even though leading officers were well aware that budget cuts meant increased workloads and longer hours for the rank and file ,  they had not openly acknowledged these pressures with their staff and how they might affect day-to-day decision-making  preventing an authentic dialogue about the problems or possible solutions 


-  One leading officer said ,  We are really struggling ,  and were not admitting that to people on the ground 


-  Officers and staff felt the pressure but ,  given the lack of open discussion ,  assumed that senior leaders did not care 


-  ,  In organizations with  culture of transparency ,  people are more inclined to seek to understand the underlying rationale for decisions 


-  This has  positive effect on ethical decision-making because values are exposed when they are openly discussed rather than inferred from town hall meetings or company documentation 


-  We dont make decisions in hiding; we make decisions in  very consultative way 


-  ,  Most decisions will affect more than one set of stakeholders 


-  Although the needs of all groups can sometimes be met ,  trade-offs are usually necessary 


-  ,  In the retail company ,  leaders paid lip service to meeting customers needs above all others ,  but their behavior wasnt always consistent with that message ,  which created confusion 


-  Employees reported that decision-making was more often governed by immediate profit considerations and key performance indicators 


-  Some felt  degree of cynicism toward the companys customer first rhetoric ,  believing that in practice senior executives were more concerned about hitting performance and sales targets by persuading customers to buy add-on products and services than about caring for the customer or providing excellent customer service 


-  One employee said: You always have that tagline at the end ,  The customer comes first ,  but at the end of the day its  business and the people at the top know we need to hit  KPI figure 


-  ,  Providing employees with  clear statement of vision can help them weigh competing concerns and make appropriate trade-offs 


-  In the police force ,  for instance ,   widely shared Plan on  Page helped officers understand policing priorities  ( such as child abuse and exploitation ,  modern slavery ,  and violence )  and provided guidance on serving the needs of the community  ( by putting the victim first and communicating effectively with the public )  while also making the most efficient use of resources 


-  VW is  case in point: Though senior executives claimed to care about clean diesel ,  they apparently both condoned deliberate cheating on emissions tests and encouraged employees to hide or destroy its evidence 


-  As one employee in the construction business said ,  If your direct line manager isnt setting an example for you ,  it detracts from the message that the business is giving 


-  In the retail business ,  for example ,  the staff talked positively of the family atmosphere and shared values within individual stores and regions that counteracted the dominant cost control messages from the head office 


-  However ,   much more reliable approach is to set the desired example at the top 


-  The nonprofit fostered an ethically strong situation by clearly showing how core ethical dilemmas should be resolved: When  company bidding to work with it asked one of the nonprofits trustees to put in  good word for it ,  its leaders immediately ruled out the company as  partner due to  misalignment of ethical values 


-  As one police officer said ,  they help people understand why we need to behave ,  act ,  do things in  certain way ,  and what the consequences are for not doing that 


-  For example ,  at the nonprofit we examined ,  employees were frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas when working with clients ,  such as how to assess mental capacity or how to manage end-of-life issues and determine appropriate levels of treatment and support 


-  The organization helps its employees make ethical decisions by developing clear policies on approaches to care and providing training that specifically focuses on such challenges 


-  ,  Similarly ,  at the construction company ,  part of the recruitment process involves matching applicants ethical values with those of the business 


-  It has also adopted  code of conduct and  formal framework called What Good Looks Like to guide employee behavior 


-  Training on topics such as how to deal with anti-competition risks and health and safety issues is compulsory for line managers ,  and an online system allows for logging any health and safety issues as they arise 


-  Although employees sometimes feel that these processes slow decision-making ,  they provide clarity and consistency ,  and people know what is expected of them ,  according to  front-line manager 


-  Ethical breaches will inevitably arise ,  of course  whether through error ,  neglect ,  or deliberate action 


-  But ethically strong organizations explicitly say how people should deal with them when they do occur ,  in addition to trying to prevent them in the first place 


-  For example ,  employees in the construction company are required to challenge decisions and actions that could compromise the health and safety of employees and customers alike 


-  One manager said that the culture around this is so strong that in extreme circumstances ,  people have lost their jobs because they havent followed through on what really is their duty to either challenge it there and then or report it later to make sure remedial action can be put in place 


-  ,  In ethically weak organizations ,  challenging peoples behavior is not the norm 


-  Sometimes employees fear retribution ,  because they do not see others around them raising questions 


-  The construction companys ethical vision of sustainability translates into protecting the environment as well as safeguarding its employees and customers 


-  ,  When  companys mission or vision is unclear or divorced from ethics ,  or ,  as  senior leader at the retail organization said ,  when the why is missing altogether ,  an opportunity to provide guidance is lost and an ethically weak situation develops 


-  ,  Setting the stage for ethical behavior isnt just  top-down exercise  though clear direction and positive role-modeling from senior executives do help 


-  ,  No company is immune from ethically questionable decision-making 


-  The problem is that there is little evidence to support these new approaches 


-  We are not specifically arguing in favor of traditional ratings ,  nor do we believe most legacy performance and feedback systems are built to address todays talent management challenges 


-  The answer to complexity is not oversimplification; the right process is the one that leverages the known facts about what drives performance 


-  Today ,  HR too often ignores these facts ,  instead chasing bright ,  shiny objects ,  what John Boudreau and Steven Rice have referred to as flavor-of-the-day HR novelties 


-  1: Its  problem that employees dont like formal performance feedback 


-  Yes ,  there is certainly evidence that people dont like feedback 


-  An employees satisfaction with feedback has  powerful mediating impact on performance; if he or she is dissatisfied with feedback ,  other performance factors ,  such as accountability or confidence in performing the task ,  plummet 


-  And regardless of how happy you are ,  addressing the problem is the best possible outcome 


-  The risk of this approach is that leaders avoid giving feedback ,  or sugarcoat it to the point that it has no practical value ,  or simply deliver it poorly 


-  Studies show that positive feedback may lead to  decrease in effort ,  just as negative feedback may boost ones desire to achieve more 


-  Also ,  receiving only positive feedback keeps people from taking in negative feedback long term 


-  An experimental study of strategic decision-makers showed that resting on the laurels of past successes and consistently getting only positive feedback will impede people from listening to negative feedback in the future ,  when it may actually be needed to correct  faulty course of action 


-  Several factors should be taken into consideration to match the right message with the right person in  concrete situation 


-  For instance ,  motivation improves both when positive feedback is given to people with  promotion focus  ( those who want to achieve and take risk ,  who are sensitive to rewards )  and when negative feedback is given to people with  prevention focus  ( those who want to avoid trouble and are generally cautious ,  who are sensitive to punishment )  


-  Negative feedback can be especially beneficial in critical events  novel ,  uncertain ,  first-time situations when the individual cares deeply about the outcome ,  such as leading  new team or managing  crisis 


-  Yet  blanket belief that bad feedback is bad aligns with most peoples desire to avoid conflict 


-   study at  large Midwestern university demonstrated that there is  tipping point at which an increase in feedback frequency leads to  decrease in task effort and performance 


-   study conducted  few years ago tells us that too much feedback can be particularly harmful at the early learning stage 


-  Of course ,  this is only one study 


-  Yet its  helpful reminder that not all our long-held assumptions may be correct  and our mistaken assumptions may come back to haunt us if we hinge business decisions on them 


-  There are notable examples of companies that take  comprehensive view of performance management and the role of feedback 


-  Facebook is one of them 


-  Refusing to board the abandon-the-ratings bandwagon ,  the company published the article Lets Not Kill Performance Evaluations Yet 


-  Most HR leaders would accept this as fact 


-  Yet if there is lack of trust in the manager-employee relationship ,  the weight of the feedback decreases dramatically 


-  We learned from  study of bank workers that source credibility  trust in the person giving feedback  strongly correlates with perceived accuracy and with  desire to respond ,  both of which have an impact on performance 


- 12 When trust and engagement with managers are low ,  feedback wont drive the desired outcomes 


-  HR must then look for alternative sources of feedback ,  such as  360-degree assessment ,  because feedback from  low-credibility leader wont change anything 


-  For this myth to become truth ,  the manager has to deliver quality feedback that takes into account  variety of factors  ( such as task ,  context ,  and personal characteristics )  and synthesizes them into an appropriate message 


-  Such  message could ,  in fact ,  be  performance rating 


-  When people dont know how they objectively compare with others ,  they are less likely to put in discretionary effort 


- 14  rating is  helpful mechanism to ensure consistency in delivering the organizational message to the individual about the level of performance relative to expectations 


-  Even those managers who indicate they know what to say to help employees develop ,  and how to say it ,  need  support process to guide them 


-  Out of 500 managers surveyed globally ,  about  third confessed that they did not know how to help people change ,  and less than 10% said they knew how to make such behavioral change sustainable 


-  For example ,  CEB Inc 


-  Oversimplifying performance management in times when the managers need structure most is hardly responsible 


-  ,  Changes to performance management that respond to just one or two chosen facts ,  while ignoring the complexity of human performance ,  waste an opportunity to drive individual performance and organizational success 


-  ,  The examples above indicate the complexity of performance management and the dangers of relying on buzzwords and sound bites to redesign processes 


-  We know that feedback is  key component in gaining this self-awareness ,  and self-aware people are more successful 


-  In their seminal book The Leadership Machine ,  Mike Lombardo and Bob Eichinger outline six key sources of personal growth ,  and feedback is one of them 


- 18 Of course ,  other individual and organizational aspects contribute ,  such as  feedback-rich environment and the individuals desire to engage in the conversation ,  and we must embrace this multidimensionality 


-  Improving feedback is not only about training managers ,  but also about organizational culture ,   sharp focus on performance ,  and holding leaders accountable for people development 


-  ,  Understanding what good feedback looks like ,  and how it can be delivered ,  will help win over even the most feedback-averse manager 


-  ,  We think of feedback as an investment of time and resources: Bad investments destroy value ,  good investments add value ,  and the best investments create sustainable value 


-  How does HR make feedback  best investment? ,  Create an approach that links feedback to the business strategy or company philosophy 


-  When giving feedback ,  take time to explain how the business is doing 


- 19 And what are better words to describe the current business environment than complex and nonlinear? ,  Ensure your system focuses on performance first ,  development second 


-  Focusing on performance goals gets people to act more quickly and with more zeal than  personal development target does 


-  While the managers main goal is to increase performance ,  the positioning of feedback works best when it contains the expectation of change and when it provokes the recipient to think in terms of  learning goal ,  such as ,  Yes ,   am keen to know how to design responsive web pages 


-  In one study ,   group of students were given two challenging tasks separated by  period of time 


-  They received feedback on how well they performed the first time around 


-  Those with  proving-goal orientation  ( for example ,  I must prove  am worthy of  promotion or I must do better than George on this )  did worse 


- 22 ,  Employee satisfaction with feedback creates  virtuous circle 


-  When employees receive feedback that they perceive to be valuable and intended to help them improve ,  other factors of performance are unlocked: utility  ( I believe feedback will help me achieve my goals )  ,  accountability  ( I ought to do my job well )  ,  self-efficacy  ( I am able to perform the task )  ,  and social awareness  ( I take others opinions of my work seriously )  


-  Giving employees feedback on how their behaviors help or hamper their ability to achieve the desired business outcomes will be more effective and position them for success in the future 


-  The nature of derailers  behaviors that impede success  is such that most people are either unaware of theirs or unable to control them without help 


-  Focusing only on strengths can be detrimental to individuals careers ,  as organizations are quite unforgiving about limitations  managers deselect for things that people are not good at 


- 25 Delivering performance feedback in  manner that helps the employee realize his or her own nonproductive behaviors leads to  better mood at work ,  greater job satisfaction ,  and stronger organizational commitment 


-   study was conducted with two groups of students taking part in  computer simulation 


-  One group received generic feedback on their people management decisions ,  and the other got more specific feedback 


-  For specificity ,  point out the exact behaviors that need to be improved ,  using facts and concrete situations from the recent past ,  and relate them to customer or peer feedback ,  if available 


-  To switch to the more generic level ,  ask open-ended questions  ( Changing which one behavior will make the biggest difference for your results? )  ,  link individual results with the companys strategy ,  or encourage employees to compare their performance with that of the best in the company and the industry 


-  There are moments in life when less is more 


-  Choose one or two critical points to deliver and focus on those 


-  Being structured and focused helps 


-  It encourages feedback that is structured ,  and drives consistency both vertically within  department or  division and horizontally across the organization 


-  It makes it easy for leaders to identify and prioritize behaviors ,  by restricting feedback to critical points or limiting feedback to selected behaviors 


-  They must consider the complexity of the operating environment ,  the adversity of situations ,  and the support that has or has not been provided to help employees attain their goals 


-  We call these factors feedback modifiers 


-  They complicate the job of delivering accurate and useful feedback ,  but they are essential to how the employee will see the credibility of the feedback provider and to the accuracy of the feedback 


-  The fact that this adds complexity is why those who lead others are paid  premium 


-  Managerial discretion is part of performance evaluation and ,  we believe ,  usually  positive aspect 


- 30 Managerial discretion also enables leaders to take account of everything that determines performance ,  including mitigating factors that would rightly impact perceptions of fairness 


-  However ,  this same discretion can have negative consequences  through managers unconscious biases or more malevolent factors ,  such as the politics of the organization 


- 31 ,  These noise factors can make it hard to provide fair ,  consistent ,  and useful feedback 


-  Examples of noise include: ,  When managers have the right understanding of feedback ,  their job becomes much easier 


-  We change and update our views about how the world works all the time 


-   danger of that is that we are likely to be drawn to bright ,  shiny objects or trends du jour; psychologists call these salience and recency effects 


-  HR must help organizations and their leaders guard against such cognitive biases and work hard on building beliefs based on scientific evidence 


-  ,  GEs Jack Welch once said ,  As  manager ,  you owe candor to your people , 33 and collectively we need to do  better job at enabling better ,  more candid feedback 


-  But ,  of course ,  it takes two to tango ,  and it may be unfair to lay blame on managers alone 


-  All of these ,  too ,  are the managers job to address by  surprise!  giving timely and accurate feedback 


-  ,  We conclude that  lack of honest ,  focused ,  and timely performance feedback is  major constraint to organizational performance 


-  Unfortunately ,  we see too many examples of HR ignoring the difficult facts in favor of simplistic ,  flavor-of-the-month solutions that will only make matters worse 


-  Lombardo and Eichinger ,  experts on derailment ,  put it in no uncertain terms: Getting no developmental feedback or feedback on strengths alone are time bombs which explode in managerial and executive roles 


- 35 It is HRs job to take on the difficult challenge of instilling  robust and comprehensive approach to feedback and performance management that fits the particular needs of the organization 


-  The approach must give managers the tools to truly improve  companys performance and give employees the path to self- and career improvement
