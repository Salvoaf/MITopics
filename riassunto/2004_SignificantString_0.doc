- Should birds of  feather flock together? Not if the goal is to promote innovation ,  says Rachelle  


-  Sampson ,  assistant professor of logistics ,  business and public policy at the University of Marylands Robert  


-  After studying hundreds of research and development  ( R&D )  alliances ,  Sampson reports in her 2004 working paper R&D Alliances and Firm Performance: The Impact of Technological Diversity and Alliance Organization on Innovation that alliances work best when there are moderate differences in technological capabilities between the partners 


-  Whats more ,  she finds ,  the organizational form of an alliance can have  significant effect on the amount of innovation it yields 


-  ,  Alliances have become increasingly popular as companies look for  higher return on their R&D investments 


-  They often offer  nimbler alternative to that of in-house development ,  while allowing companies to share risks and costs 


-  But many alliances fall short of their founders expectations 


-  Knowledge transfer is  tricky business ,  particularly when knowledge is complex or tacit 


-  Moreover ,  mutual distrust often hinders learning within alliances 


-  Todays partner ,  after all ,  may turn out to be tomorrows competitor 


-  ,  In order for alliances to succeed ,  Sampson observes ,  the partners must be both able and willing to share knowledge-based capabilities 


-  First ,  the level of technological diversity shapes an alliances potential payoff  if the partners are too different ,  theyll have little to say to one another; if theyre too similar ,  theyll have little to learn 


-  Second ,  an alliances organizational form helps determine the likelihood that its potential will be achieved 


-  Drawing on two complementary theoretical perspectives  transaction-cost economics and the knowledge-based view  Sampson argues that knowledge transfer is easier within more hierarchical organizational forms ,  such as equity joint ventures ,  which benefit from clear lines of authority and common routines 


-  In addition ,  cooperation may be more likely in these types of alliance 


-  Managers sometimes hesitate to invest in an alliance out of concern that it might be captured by the other side 


-  Giving alliances greater organizational independence and more formal governance can help allay these fears 


-  ,  These advantages are likely to be especially important when technological diversity is high 


-  When knowledge sharing is relatively straightforward ,  equity joint ventures may not have  significant advantage over looser organizational forms ,  such as alliances that are based on bilateral contracts 


-  But once the barriers to cooperation start to rise ,  mechanisms that facilitate and encourage knowledge transfer can really pay off 


-  ,  To test these hypotheses ,  Sampson collected data on all 463 R&D alliances formed by firms in the telecommunications equipment industry between 1991 and the end of 1993 


-  She identified the level of technological diversity in each alliance by calculating the degree to which the partners patent portfolios overlapped 


-  She also constructed  measure of postalliance innovative performance for each firm by counting the patents the company applied for in the four years following an alliances formation and weighting each patent by the number of citations it received in later patent applications 


-  ,  Within this sample ,  Sampson found that firm patenting initially increased with the level of technological diversity in an alliance but then decreased 


-  For the median firm ,  participating in an alliance with moderate diversity contributed nearly 14 times more to postalliance patenting than participating in an alliance with low diversity 


-  Similarly ,  moderate-diversity alliances outperformed high-diversity alliances by  factor of  


-  ( This analysis controlled for  variety of factors ,  including pre-alliance patenting ,  alliance scope ,  experience with alliances and prior linkages between the partners 


-  )  ,  Splitting the sample by organizational form produced similar results 


-  Of the 463 alliances Sampson studied ,  398 were based on bilateral contracts ,  and 65 were organized as equity joint ventures 


-  In both subsamples ,  postalliance patenting initially rose and then fell with technological diversity 


-  However ,  equity joint ventures had  significant advantage over bilateral contracts once an alliances diversity exceeded  


-  )  At  moderate level of diversity ,  equity joint ventures delivered 35 times more innovation than contract-based alliances 


-  When diversity was high ,  the median firm was found to have benefited over 100 times more from  joint venture 


-  ,  Sampson is wary of basing out-of-sample predictions on these findings  in other words ,  your mileage may vary  or even of endorsing equity joint ventures outright 


-  After all ,  all forms of organization have disadvantages  ( including higher setup costs and more bureaucracy in this particular case )  


-  Instead ,  she says ,  managers should draw two broad conclusions from her research 


-  First ,  there is an optimal level of technological diversity within an alliance 


-  And second ,  organization matters 


-  Its not something you throw to the in-house counsel after youve closed the deal 


-  Its  critical strategic variable that can help determine how much bang an alliance delivers for each R&D buck
