-  ,   new tool for assessing what constitutes best-practice ITPM is the IT portfolio management maturity model 


-  For example ,  an IT audit of  major Fortune 500 investment bank found four customer-relationship-management  ( CRM )  projects under way in three divisions using software from different vendors 


-  Having developed methods for evaluating and prioritizing investment proposals ,  the corporate IT department also has instituted central budget oversight and ,  most likely ,  maintains  central project-management office 


-  Pertinent IT personnel have  basic understanding of the financial metrics used to make investment decisions  the portfolio having been defined in terms of an initial set of agreed-upon facts 


-  Their portfolios are managed in the sense that they are part of existing management-control processes 


-  Those analyses translate into benefits-realization reviews at the end of each project 


-  ,  The more successful companies therefore link strategy to IT portfolio investments using  process similar to one first laid out in the late 1990s: Define the companywide strategic intent and business objectives; understand the strategic context of the company; develop business and IT objectives matched to corporate strategic objectives; develop an appropriate portfolio of business and IT investments to support the strategic business objective; and keep updating 


-  We ask ,  What is the business need? What does the business owner want the technology to do or the investment of information technology to provide? If it provides that ,  what are the business outcomes that will change? For example ,  what will change in terms of customer satisfaction? What will change in terms of increased revenues? What will change in terms of decreased costs? Then on the basis of the total cost of ownership of putting the investment in place ,  they ask ,  What is the increased support and infrastructure that might be required? Every project goes through such an analysis 


-  Says Boushy ,  In 2002 ,  we sent out 228 , 000 customer-satisfaction surveys 


-  This enables us to objectively measure the value of customer-satisfaction IT initiatives and ties back into the IT portfolio-management process 


-  Qualitative data analysis of the interview transcripts revealed what the interviewees considered to be the top 10 benefits of ITPM 


-  We have developed strong application-development and project-management skills 


-  We are training other parts of the organization in project-management techniques 


-  ,  the largest waste-management-services company in the United States ,  with $11 billion in revenues in 2002 ,  is the result of  series of acquisitions 


-  ,  Forty-six percent said business leaders didnt understand that ROI is not always applicable 


-  As many as 36% of respondents saw  lack of mutual respect between IT and business executives; 30% perceived business leaders as lacking basic technological understanding; and 28% said business executives regarded IT as  necessary evil 


-  They were used to giving us rough ideas ,  and we would use our imagination to define what we thought they wanted 


-  As the CIO of  major financial-services firm observed ,  Each business unit would manage its own IT budget 


-  It was  big concern for them ,  and it took us four years to change their mind-set 


-  Says the CIO of  capital-goods manufacturer ,  We ran into  strong desire to keep costs under the radar screen 


-  ,  The ambiguity inherent in quantifying ITs business value ,  the lack of communication ,  executives limited understanding of and low respect for IT ,  and IT staffers inadequate business skills  all translate to major organizational challenges for successful implementation 


-  When the North American division of  large foreign car manufacturer decided to subject its 352 e-commerce initiatives to the rigors of portfolio diagnosis ,  only 30 core initiatives survived 


-  ,  Recognizing it was misspending IT dollars ,  the car company set out to create an inventory of all projects ,  reassess business-capability needs and develop an investment-prioritization and decision-making mechanism 


-  Each criterion was built from two to nine questions  each translating to  10-point scale  such as Does this project address an identified need? What is our expected payback period? and What is the expected risk- and time-adjusted return on investment? In the end ,  only five of those 58 desired capabilities were judged to be business-critical 


-  ,  Finally ,  at the fifth stage ,  new capabilities are incorporated into existing budgeting and decision-making processes 


-  ,  Training people in the ITPM process as well as in financial and project-management skills enables them to develop better metrics to define IT success and failure for the particular situation 


-  ,  The key to bridging the business-technology divide and improving results is early communication 


-  Not only must senior business managers understand more about how IT affects both strategy and the bottom line ,  but CIOs also need to learn to communicate the vision ,  strategies and goals of the IT organization in terms that non-IT executives can understand
