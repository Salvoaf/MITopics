-  Peter Senge ,  director of MITs Center for Organizational Learning ,  then proposed characteristics that tomorrows organizations will need to foster ,  and the group responded to those 


-  Which is harder to manage ,  technology or people? Which matters more? Will the trend toward radical outsourcing continue ,  or are we learning that ,  by outsourcing ,  we lose control? Are organizations increasingly unpleasant places to work? Will the gap between the haves and have nots continue to grow and ,  if so ,  at what price? ,  Walter Kiechel III ,  former managing editor ,  Fortune ,  moderator ,  Edgar Bronfman ,  Jr 


-   think this combination underlies the changes that companies are experiencing 


-  What do you think? ,  Tizado: Well have to get our people participating more 


-  For example ,  we need to develop stronger in-house research and development capabilities to keep up with the competition 


-  Those things happen through engagement with family or work  so the key to motivation is designing organizations congruent with those needs 


-  We tend to see technology as the driving force behind change ,  instead of as one enabling factor 


-  We try to stick close to our competencies and create products that consumers are prepared to pay  bit more for ,  which involves branding ,  marketing ,  communicating ,  innovating ,  and being  low-cost manufacturer 


-  At the end of the day ,  its what you need to do to keep your brands first in the consumers mind 


-  ,  Kiechel: Some people say that the model of the effective organization will not be the hierarchical industrial firm ,  but rather the professional service firm ,  with networks of expertise and  capacity for knowledge building 


-  Do you see that? ,  Schiro:  dont think theres one answer 


-  ,  Kiechel: Whats proven hardest about trying to foster change in your organizations? ,  Teerlink: Most of us grew up in  command-and-control environment ,  and ,  as much as we want to move away from that ,  its very difficult 


-   think that products like Lotus Notes can help deconstruct power relationships  and we use our products before we sell them  but learning to relate horizontally as well as hierarchically is our hardest organizational issue 


-  Isnt this sort of in our genes? Can we really expect to change even if we need to? ,  Goldstein: North American business culture revolves around command and control 


-  In that sense ,  empowerment might be easier in Europe 


-  ,  Turner: Surely the problem is that we have gradually acquired knowledge and structures that no longer work 


-  How do we unlearn the past practices? Perhaps we need an Institute of Unlearning 


-  ,  Bronfman: Its difficult to unlearn something when you dont know what it is youre meant to be learning 


-  How did you change in the process? ,  OBrien: Work is both objective and subjective 


-  We get better and better at the objective part 


-  What has been disregarded ,  except in  superficial way ,  is the subjective nature of work  what the work experience does to the human being 


-  ,  Kiechel: How do you reconcile the necessity to engage the subjective nature of the worker with the necessity of keeping the organization profitable in an increasingly competitive world? ,  Goldstein: Bills comments are not inconsistent with that model 


-  We can easily share standardizable bits of information ,  and those get spread widely ,  but theres no evidence that we can use technology to share the more refined aspects of human understanding 


-  If we dont make that distinction ,  well think were sharing everything important 


-  It drives me nuts when people talk about knowledge-sharing computer systems 


-  ,  Kiechel: Im  little troubled by this notion that there is something we cant share via technology 


-  Our fixation at Lotus is on communication as much as it is on information putting information in motion ,  allowing richer forms of communication to develop around it ,  so that ,  instead of thinking about what it is  information  you think about what youre going to do with it 


-   question that concerns me more is What do we want in the first place? The most important thing technologies do is to reduce the constraints on whats possible 


-   think the cats out of the bag on centralization 


-  As  result ,  it makes no sense for eight white guys at the top of the company to make decisions for 400 , 000 people around the world 


-  ,  Malone: Its interesting to consider what kind of leadership is needed to make coherence emerge from  decentralized system 


-  ,  Goldstein:  wouldnt want you running my R&D program 


-  Maybe there are other ways to create  context in which the things you want to occur will occur 


-  ,  Malone:  group of us at MIT are thinking about what the twenty-first century organization will consist of ,  and the scenarios  describe today grew out of our work 


-  Many of the functions that large organizations fulfill today would need to be fulfilled in some other way 


-  Who would you talk to? How would you learn things? Who would worry about health insurance? Who would think about your income ups and downs? It seems to us that these functions could be performed by organizations independent of the task structure itself maybe professional societies ,  fraternities ,  service clubs ,  or unions 


-  Now ,  the cost of coordinating network technology is ,  increasingly ,  the factor that determines the size of an organization 


-  But the extreme scenario  who knows? ,  Kiechel: Tom ,  could you explain what coordination means and why networking technology can substitute market mechanisms for vertical integration? ,  Malone: Whenever two activities interact ,  you have to coordinate that interaction 


-  Why? Theyre trying to minimize the cash-flow variations ,  and ,  more important ,  they want to reconnect with  professional community 


-  They develop  sense that the tank is being drained and they need to refill it 


-  ,  Senge: The world of individual craftspeople  hundred years ago might have been similar ,  and it worked ,  but the underlying social structure was reasonably coherent and stable 


-  In any big city ,  youll find  Polish community ,  an Irish community 


-  Yet in the United Kingdom during the past year ,  weve lost something like 200 , 000 full-time jobs ,  and weve seen 800 , 000 people become self-employed in part-time jobs 


-  In our organization ,  we no longer see the need to employ  bank cashier full-time; instead we employ two or three cashiers part-time 


-  ,  Kiechel: Let me argue that social maintenance organizations wont emerge 


-  Are we creating  world of radical individualism? ,  Bronfman: Organizations in 2020 will give employees what they want  not the other way around 


-  Traditionally ,  organizations have delivered what people wanted  stability ,  steady income ,  community ,  career advancement 


-  Those things are breaking down ,  but people will figure out what they need instead ,  and organizations will deliver 


-  ,  Manzi: The human need for affiliation wont disappear; as social disintegration proceeds ,  well adapt ,  and other forms of affiliation will emerge 


-  ,  Schiro:  want to go back to what Edgar said about organizations being pushed by their own employees desires  we see this in our organization 


-  Our consultants ,  for example ,  travel 70 to 80 percent of the time; they dont need  home-based office ,  and ,  in some cases ,  they dont want one 


-  ,  Kiechel: How are they meeting their need for affiliation? ,  Goldstein: We still find opportunities to bring people together ,  but much less than when we all started every week by going into the office on Monday morning 


-  To make cars ,  for example ,  you still need  critical mass somewhere 


-  Those people in manufacturing wont have the kind of high-tech life were describing 


-  Fewer people will work in manufacturing ,  but there will still be  lot of them 


-  ,  Kiechel: If we had been sitting around this table one hundred years ago ,  we probably would have been talking about agriculture; were always going to need to raise food ,  we would have said 


-  The number of manufacturing operatives is less than 17 percent of the work-force ,  which is  little less than the number of ,  say ,  Irish Americans in the total population ,  and ,  while we value their contributions ,  we dont consider Irish Americans paradigmatic citizens 


-  ,  Senge:  think the point of scenario thinking is not to validate or invalidate the prediction ,  but to think through the implications 


-  As  think about Toms scenario ,  the question that arises is about collective rather than individual production 


-  At Fortune ,  would it be enough to have  group of talented free-lance writers? Or is there  style ,   collective quality of investigation and thinking that ,  if unshared ,  would make even the most talented writer incapable of producing  good Fortune article? How does that need for collective knowledge ,  collective capability ,  get addressed in this scenario? ,  Malone: In the car design vignette ,  we postulated  huge database of information on things related to the project 


-  Peters question ,  which is very interesting ,  encompasses not only how you share the task-related knowledge ,  but also how you share the other kinds of knowledge that create  sense of community 


-  ,  Melbourn: Top management is  control factor 


-  He decides the shape and format of this system 


-  We cant get results without  control factor ,  whether its government intervention ,  or the editor ,  or the designer 


-   think this disintermediation will be fairly short lived ,  because it makes control so much harder to exert 


-  ,  We assume that these huge companies would provide cradle-to-grave life maintenance needs for their employees 


-  The company would take care of your health insurance ,  your education ,  your social networking ,  your reputation ,  your sense of identity ,  your community ,  your job security ,  your income 


-  We even assume that it would be unusual for two people in the same family to work for different companies 


-  ,  Schiro: You have just described something  saw at the beginning of my career in the capital-intensive mining companies of the 1950s and 1960s 


-  Its  necessity 


-  ,  Goldstein: Thats the pivotal point ,  isnt it? If theres no infrastructure in an emerging market ,  then by necessity you create one 


-  Weve done some of that ,  but we eventually decided it wasnt what we were about 


-  ,  Kiechel: What would it be like to work in one of these organizations? ,  Senge: Its hard to see how youd create  sense of affiliation in an organization with five million people 


-   wouldnt want to work there 


-  ,  Kiechel: Doesnt Price Waterhouse have something similar to elections? Would you recommend it as  model? ,  Schiro: Yes ,  it works for us 


-  In theory ,  at least ,  the stock market is the mechanism we use to vote our opinion of management 


-   raise this point because  think were in danger of taking the scenarios too literally 


-   dont think of them as literal at all 


-  Theyre intended to push us to think about whether theres  trend this way or that way 


-  ,  Kiechel: Peter Senge ,  tell us about the biggest human issues well have to face if we want to be around in 2020 


-  ,  Senge:  find Im less concerned about predicting what the firm of 2020 will look like than  am about developing  shared understanding of the capabilities well need on the way 


-  We wanted to learn to produce more reliably  kind of conversation that weve probably all experienced  where we suspend our normal instinct ,  which is to win our point ,  so we can end the conversation thinking in ways we didnt before it started 


-  We thought it was important ,  but we hardly thought the firms we worked with would consider it  top priority 


-  The principle is simple: to converse productively ,  we need to know where the other persons coming from 


-  ,  As  result ,  Im beginning to think that we have an immense hunger to reestablish the art of conversation 


-  ,  OBrien: If  had the assignment of transforming the culture in  corporation ,   would spend 90 percent of my resources on the organizations ability to converse and think 


-  In our culture ,  while were extraordinarily good at small talk ,  we are deplorable at talking about serious subjects on which we have differing assumptions and opinions 


-  ,  Kiechel: How do you get conversations going? ,  Schiro: You talk about something people are interested in 


-  ,  Kiechel: One can understand why an employee would be fearful 


-  How can you drive out fear in that kind of climate? ,  Melbourn:  dont think you drive it out 


-  Theres an enormous need for the senior management team ,  and especially the person in charge ,  to model behavior 


-  We need to dig  little deeper and ask ,  Under what circumstances do  derail? What assumptions do  hold that ,  when looked at  little harshly ,  are contrary to open communication? For example ,  do  think  know whats going on? When top managers describe reality  what they perceive as reality  with an air of certainty and authority ,  they create an incredible mantle of ineffectiveness ,  because everyone then looks up to them to solve the problems ,  to do the thinking 


-  ,  Kiechel: What values do organizations need? ,  Harris:  dont think  generic set of values applies to all organizations 


-  Apart from that ,  the organization needs to align values with the direction and mission 


-  ,  Kiechel: What does each panelist think about most when looking ahead? ,  Melbourn: How do  keep my feet on the ground? How do  remember my traditional values? And how do  take the 90 , 000 people in my workforce with me? ,  Scott Morton: In twenty years ,  the world will be  vastly different place 


-  In every organization Ive worked with for more than  couple days ,  everyone realizes how much baloney is going on 


-  Theres always  deep sense of frustration 


-   think we mask all that with rhetoric about the need to change and the commitment to profits 


-  Its  bunch of nonsense 


-  Results are about three or four down on our priority list ,  not in rhetoric ,  but in fact 


-   believe that the future CEO will understand that employees are the issue 


-  We have to create an environment that attracts and nurtures talented people ,  so that we can help our clients anticipate and adapt to change 


-  My biggest fear is that our desire for other kinds of fulfillment will be subverted ,  or diverted ,  by hypocrisy 


-  We have to create new business to do that in order to protect the stock of knowledge that weve built in our organization 


-   think that comes back to the critical difference between management and leadership 


-  ,  OBrien: Im driven by the need to design organizations around values so that we can achieve two things: disperse power but maintain order and discipline ,  and bring the moral culture down through the organization to the front line 


-   think were making organizations into more and more unpleasant places to work 


-   dont think thats sustainable
