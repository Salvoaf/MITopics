- The event was running over ,  the car was waiting ,  but the keynote speaker did not seem to mind 


-  Whats the best way to get ready?  woman asked 


-  Leaders in every sector seem to agree: Learning is an imperative ,  not  clich 


-  We want to learn ,  but we worry that we might not like what we learn 


-  Or that we will have to give up cherished ideas 


-  There is often some shame involved in learning something new as an adult ,   mentor told me at the start of my career 


-  What if ,  in the process ,  were found lacking? What if we simply cannot pick up the knowledge and skills we need?  have spent two decades studying adult learning ,  helping companies design and deploy learning initiatives ,  and teaching and coaching thousands of high potentials and executives all over the world 


-  And  have found that mentors words to be wise: Nothing truly novel ,  nothing that matters ,  is ever learned with ease 


-  In my work ,   hear the same complaints over and over again: ,  Even though we want to learn and companies need us to ,  its hard ,  and we get little space for it 


-  Part of the problem ,   have found ,  is that we often think of learning as something that happens at work or alongside it 


-  ,  So how can employers make space for learning ,  and how can we as individuals tackle the work of learning ,  especially the sort of learning that transforms careers and organizations? Both endeavors require understanding that learning is plural 


-  There is more than one kind ,  and each kind needs its own space and challenges us in different ways 


-  Despite their history of strong performance ,  both were saddled with  perception that they were not agile enough  ( management-speak for stuck in their ways )  


-  ,  When  met Andrew ,  it did not take him long to admit that he did not really want to change 


-  He wanted  hack 


-  ,  Learning threatened Sandra in  different way 


-  Trying something too new felt reckless in her role 


-  The pull of habits and the push of expectations are familiar to anyone who works hard to earn others trust 


-  The more valuable our identities and commitments are ,  the less space we feel we have to question them 


-  On the contrary ,  we shore them up ,  developing ways to keep potential shame at bay ,  such as focusing on performance and the organizations demands 


-  ,  Managers could be forgiven for concluding  ( like Andrews and Sandras bosses did )  that we are not learning much when we proceed this way 


-  ,  We are all ,  in fact ,  learning every day 


-  We expand our knowledge and refine our skills in ways that strengthen our identities and commitments 


-  Incremental learning does not alter the way we see others ,  the world ,  and ourselves 


-  ,  The kind of space we need for learning ,  and the way to make the most of that space ,  depends on what kind of learning we are after 


-  For incremental learning ,  we need  more focused ,  less distracting ,  safer replica of our workplace   boot camp of sorts ,  where we can practice the best possible way of doing things ,  get feedback ,  and try again 


-  If we are after transformative learning ,  what we need is  familiar yet open frame   playground of sorts that magnifies our habits and the culture that breeds them so that we can examine both ,  and imagine and try new ways of being 


-  ,   boot camp must replicate workplace constraints to help us master ways of navigating them more efficiently 


-  Providing some distance from day-to-day reality allows us to get real in  deeper sense 


-   boot camp amplifies and exploits the shame of learning ,  helping us learn how not to be found wanting 


-   playground exposes and challenges that shame ,  helping us realize that if we were less anxious ,  it might be easier to claim what we want and discover how to get it 


-  ,  Thats what Andrew and Sandra needed but didnt have 


-  Andrew understood the classic trap of talent: What got him noticed as  future leader got in the way of becoming one 


-  Sandra feared the curse of successful executives ,  which is being seen as  monument to the past that stands in the way of the future 


- 10 What they did not get was that to make the leap forward ,  they did not need to master  new way to act but rather  new way to learn 


-  They both put emphasis on trying to find out what they needed to do better 


-  Boot camps cater to the performance mindset and focus on conformity at the office 


-  To help people shift to  new way of being at work ,  we need more open spaces such as leadership development workshops or strategy retreats where we are purposefully disoriented  spaces where we are freed up to question the status quo within and around us and invited to try out different directions 


-  We value and often remain loyal to them even after we leave ,  because they offer identity work spaces where we can learn to fit in and become who we aspire to be ,  as well as learn what it takes to deliver and what we need to develop 


- 11 In such spaces ,  there is focus on  broad vision and freedom to bring the vision to life in our own way 


-  We need to do the work to make the most of the spaces we are given  the work of learning from experts and experience 


-   cant argue with that 


-  But most people also admit that while we have expert mentors and plenty of experience at work ,  we do not always have so much learning ,  and change remains hard 


-  We then consider the present to define the gaps in skills we need to fill with deliberate practice 


-  ,  Playgrounds often provide  clear frame for exploration but leave it broad enough that there is not one single way to fill it 


-  ,  The ability to learn from experience in the present  from moments ,  not models  is just what is needed when the past has become  hindrance and the future is unclear 


-  ,  Since this way of working with experience is less familiar than the deliberate practice outlined above ,  let us break it down with the help of  group of executives from  tech company that  shall call Star 


-  And yet ,  most of the executives involved agreed that the company was not changing as fast as they had hoped 


-  They felt the clock ticking and wanted to discuss what they should do differently 


-  They had little appetite to do what was needed most: slow down and understand why they acted the way they did before experimenting their way toward lasting change 


-  It is easy to dismiss such exercises as unrelated to the complex real world 


-   find that to be  flimsy defense against noticing ,  voicing ,  interpreting ,  and coming to terms with what is real about those activities  the way people think ,  feel ,  and act while working together 


-  There is nothing more real ,  and consequential ,  than that in the world of work 


-  Start from what you see around you ,  but dont neglect what you sense within 


-  It is easier ,  and more fruitful ,  to learn from patterns of experience if you can approach them with an open ,  curious mind 


-  ,  Once they started sharing what they had noticed ,  most of the group members seemed to agree: After realizing that they had two viable ideas ,  they had felt obligated to prototype both 


-  More than one person admitted mixed feelings about it 


-  Someone else asked ,  Why did they feel compelled to keep going? That question moved the work toward interpretation 


-  Continue to resist judgment about what should or could have happened or what you need to do next 


-  Try to come up with interpretations that challenge the usual excuses: We were short of resources; we did not have time; that is just the way we are 


-  How did you help sustain the status quo? ,  When they began wondering why they had kept working and ignored their own doubts ,  the first interpretation the Star executives landed on was pride 


-  It could not just be pride ,  reasoned one participant ,  because their creativity had been on full display and their execution was successful the first time around 


-  It became clear that not wanting to shame others or to be shamed had been  major driver for the group ,  one that had kept them going even when it was not necessary 


-  Once you put aside interpretations that focus on external factors ,  you can begin to learn  lot about yourself and the people around you 


-  How do your history and aspirations explain what is happening? What do the events unfolding say about your relationships with others involved and about the culture you share? Try to make links between those levels 


-  And since they did not want to be caught in that shameful place themselves ,  they also avoided putting others into it 


-  Seen that way ,  product choices became existential threats 


-  And it made the imperative to stop what they were doing and change feel like  condemnation of their competence rather than an opportunity 


-  We wanted to give everyone  chance to shine ,  managers usually tell me at first ,  when  challenge their obvious overwork 


-  Seen that way ,  overwork is not the cause of our struggle to learn but  consequence   defense mechanism 


-  ,  At Star ,  executives looked for small ways to prevent overwork without inducing shame and ways to find and offer affirmation without using project approvals and successes as proxies for it 


-  For example ,  one executive told me months after the workshop ,  I keep asking myself and others ,  Are we doing this because it is really necessary or because it would be embarrassing not to do it? Using this question as  prompt for reflection helped him distinguish between those activities driven by  sense of obligation and those that truly advanced his business units strategic goals 


-  He had also begun publicly praising people who stopped doing things that did not make sense or ,  more precisely ,  that made sense only from the perspective of the old culture 


-  We can give up the overwork without giving up pride ,  he kept repeating 


-  ,   often meet people who say they want to learn from experience and really mean it ,  but they find that it is hard to muddle through without clear parameters 


-  They want to be told what to focus on ,  assess their progress  ( and be assessed )  ,  and have  plan for putting what theyll learn to immediate use 


-  That response is understandable ,  and its compatible with incremental learning ,  which fosters alignment at work 


-  Just as shame impedes learning and hampers leadership ,  having the courage to learn gives us the courage to lead 


-  ,  Once we begin to master both ways of working with experience  deliberate practice and reflective engagement  they produce less shame and more courage 


-  People who regularly make room for both types of learning ,  especially under pressure ,  eventually no longer need to be offered formal learning spaces 


-  And once we are brave enough to care for our own learning ,  we usually begin to care for others too ,  becoming the leaders that every organization needs and every employee deserves
