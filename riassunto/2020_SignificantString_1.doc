- Ever since the 1997 publication of The Innovators Dilemma ,  researchers ,  management experts ,  and businesspeople have discussed ,  dissected ,  and debated Clayton Christensens Theory of Disruptive Innovation 


-  By now ,  the arc of disruption is well established: We know how disrupters enter the market ,  and we know how incumbents typically bungle their responses to such seemingly insignificant competition 


-  Numerous books and articles have offered to solve the dilemma of disruption ,  including Christensens own The Innovators Solution  (  2003 book coauthored with Michael Raynor )  ,  which suggests that leaders who understand how disruption transpires can inoculate themselves against the threats and seize the opportunities 


-  ,  Yet ,  despite so much insight and advice ,  the dilemma persists: 63% of companies are currently experiencing disruption ,  and 44% are highly susceptible to it ,  according to research by Accenture 


-  And in  thorough analysis of more than  , 500 publicly listed companies ,  growth strategy consultancy Innosight found that only 52 of them ,  about 3% of the sample set ,  had made material progress in strategically transforming their organizations 


-  The default positions ,  it seems ,  are to squeeze extra points from profit margins ,  search for companies to acquire ,  or simply pay lip service to innovation by setting up token incubators or having executives wear jeans and the occasional hoodie 


-  ,  Why are companies still so vulnerable to disruptive threats? Our view is that it isnt about not having the right playbook 


-  The problem is that well-intentioned leaders often delude themselves by downplaying disruptive threats or overestimating the difficulty of response 


-  This article explains these delusions about disruption and offers ways to help leaders avoid self-sabotage 


-  ,  Christensen and Raynor have done  superb job of creating  framework for helping to understand industry dynamics and for planning your own growth alternatives 


-  It was on the brink of taking over the booming cellphone market 


-  Over the next few years ,  the company would grow into  seemingly unstoppable force 


-  Then ,  in November 2007 ,  Forbes ran  prophetic cover with the headline ,  Nokia: One Billion Customers  Can Anyone Catch the Cell Phone King? ,  Well ,  yes 


-  ,  Despite having dominant market share ,  despite having the resources and capabilities to transition to the smartphone era ,  and despite having  leader who endorsed and presumably understood Christensens groundbreaking theories on disruption  ( though Ala-Pietil ,  admittedly ,  left the company in 2005 )  ,  Nokia stumbled 


-  Apple famously entered the market mid-2007 


-  Google formed the Open Handset Alliance ,  powered by the Android operating system ,  later that year 


-  In 2013 ,  CEO Stephen Elop sold Nokias ailing cellphone business to Microsoft for roughly $7 billion 


-   year later ,  Microsoft took  roughly $7 billion write-down on the transaction ,  suggesting the business was worthless 


-  ,  Nokias fall is just one of many cautionary tales: Eastman Kodak ,  Blockbuster ,  and Toys  Us were all destroyed by disruption 


-  Some of todays great companies look to be similarly snared in their own innovators dilemma 


-  FedEx started in classic disruptive fashion but today is under threat from Amazon ,  which could hollow out  significant portion of FedExs core business by picking off high-value lines between hubs ,  leaving FedEx  ( and UPS )  with small ,  unprofitable routes 


-  Netflix lacks the diverse portfolio these businesses have ,  and it may be overly focused on mainstream customers while ignoring the needs of less profitable ones ,  like all of those young people who prefer creating and sharing short-form videos on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok instead of watching shows like The Crown 


-  New habit formation is often an early warning sign of disruptive change 


-  For all its innovation prowess ,  why hasnt Netflix visibly pursued growth opportunities beyond video streaming and long-form content creation? ,  And why ,  after so many years since Christensen presented his original theory and so many cautionary tales ,  do leaders continue to miss the warning signs? Our view is that the disruptive playbooks leadership section is incomplete 


-  Leaders must learn how to build the individual and organizational capability to confront powerful self-deceptions that inhibit successfully dealing with disruption 


-  ,  Powerful deceptions hinder  leaders ability to respond to disruptive threats and seize disruptive opportunities 


-  Christensens original research highlighted one such deception ,  noting how ,  ironically ,  listening to your best customers drives the innovators dilemma 


-  Companies typically focus on satisfying their best customers  ( usually their most profitable ones )  by providing better versions of current solutions while ignoring their worst customers ,  the ones most likely to flock to cheaper or more convenient disruptive solutions 


-  This is because data lags disruptive change 


-  BlackBerry is  good example 


-  He dismissed the iPhone ,  didnt mention Android ,  and smugly said ,  I dont look up too much or down too much 


-  But consider BlackBerrys performance at the time and over the next few years that followed 


-  When Balsillie gave the interview ,  BlackBerry  ( then called Research in Motion )  had just reported revenues double those in the previous fiscal year ,  to roughly $6 billion 


-  Over the next three years ,  revenues tripled ,  reaching  peak of close to $20 billion 


-  ,  Ironically ,  leaders can be adept at spotting disruption in other industries and yet be blind to whats going on right in front of their eyes 


-  Kodaks case focused on digital imaging ,  for example ,  while Hallmarks focused on online greeting cards 


-  I thought this was going to be the most boring event ever ,  admits Clark Gilbert ,  an HBS professor at the time and now president of BYU-Pathway Worldwide 


-  None of the companies could see their own problem 


-  Mark Bertolini of Aetna provides  good example of  leader who didnt wait that long to act 


-  It would have been easy for Bertolini to execute yesterdays strategy for five years and ride off into the sunset 


-  Instead ,  Bertolini made the courageous decision to dramatically reconfigure the business ,  which ultimately resulted in Aetnas game-changing merger with CVS Health in early 2018 ,   first-of-its-kind combination of retail pharmacy and insurance capabilities 


-  The combination creates the potential for more affordable access to urgent and primary care 


-  The company was seeking to set  bold new direction and achieve ambitious performance targets 


-  Its leadership identified an opportunity to drive step-change growth by ,  for the first time in its history ,  bypassing traditional distributors to deliver highly customized products directly to end consumers 


-  The strategy would require substantial commitment ,  but it also promised substantial returns ,  including the ability to spur growth ,  combat commoditization ,  and increase margins 


-  Despite consensus and  serious commitment among the executive leadership team to the strategy ,  the outgoing and incoming board chairs decided  in the bathroom during  break  to significantly reduce the scope of the ambition ,  perceiving that leveraging digital technologies and bypassing traditional distributors was too risky and not in the companys short- and medium-term interests 


-  ,  The fear of messing up what has been  proven strategy is powerful ,  but the reality is that making bold investments in innovation doesnt carry systemic risks 


-  New Coke ,  Apples Newton ,  Microsofts Zune music player ,  Amazons Fire Phone ,  and Googles augmented reality glasses are all examples of big companies that made big bets that led to big write-offs 


-  But while none of these failures was good ,  of course ,  none sank their companies ,  either 


-  ,  Big moves look like they are really risky 


-  Because what you lose when you invest  ton of money is the money you invested 


-  When you win ,  you usually create not only an annuity but  new ecosystem that gives you the opportunity to win in new areas 


-  In the face of disruptive change ,  company leaders consistently invest too little ,  too slowly ,  in doing something different 


-  Walmart executives knew for years they had to embrace online retail ,  and yet from 1998 to 2015 ,  the company kept redirecting or scuttling significant investments to compete with Amazon and other e-retailers 


-  It didnt allow third-party sellers until 2009 and then for years had just six sellers on its website 


- com in 2016 has promise ,  but Walmart should have bet boldly years earlier when the capital investment required would have been much lower and the tolerance for losses  ( necessary to catch Amazon )  higher 


-  ,  Ironically ,  such late-breaking attempts to catch up on innovation after being too slow are often ,  wrongly ,  seen as proof that they offer systemic risk  Walmart is betting the store on its web strategy 


-  It might be The activists will pounce on me ,  or My shareholders wont like it ,  or The market just cares about short-term results 


-  Indeed ,  many leaders hide behind the maximize shareholder value maxim without understanding exactly what it means 


-  As Michael Mauboussin and Alfred Rappaport ,  prominent financial experts and coauthors of Expectations Investing ,  once noted: ,  Further ,  there are clear examples demonstrating that you can actively sell your shareholders on  new story ,  as long as it is indeed  convincing story and you demonstrate early success 


-  Aetnas Bertolini recalled  tense meeting early on in the companys strategic transformation where he fielded questions from investment banking analysts: I walked into  room of analysts and  said ,  You either think of me as stupid or that Im lying to you ,  neither of which makes me want to spend more time with you 


-   have had shareholders who have said to me ,  Why dont you double your dividends? Well ,   want to invest in the company 


-  So  said that one of my largest shareholders should get the hell out of my stock 


-  In 2018 ,  Harvard Business Review identified Bertolini as one of the 50 best-performing CEOs in the world and the highest-performing CEO in the health insurance industry 


-  Bertolinis decision to stand firm in the face of criticism helped drive Aetnas successful transformation 


-  4: My people arent up to the task 


-  Leaders often use their own people as an excuse not to take action 


-  For example ,  in 2018 ,  Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos told  group of CEOs that transforming his company had required turning over  staggering 80% of his top leadership team 


-  People resist change ,  he said 


- 10 Vounatsoss strategy underlines  popular perception that changing  company requires changing the staff 


-  The difficulty and pain of the rip and replace strategy is perhaps one reason why only 3% of companies researched by Innosight were embarking on significant strategic transformations 


-  ,  As  counterexample ,  DBS ,  the largest bank in Southeast Asia ,  went from  stodgy regulated bank to an innovative digital powerhouse without dramatically changing its workforce 


-  Soon after becoming CEO in 2009 ,  Piyush Gupta set  challenge: Given increasing technological change ,  DBS had to function like  27 , 000-person startup 


-  DBSs culture change effort rested on the fundamental belief that its staff had the inherent capabilities to become innovators but lacked the tools and support to realize them 


-  Under the leadership of Paul Cobban ,  chief data and transformation officer ,  the bank redesigned its offices ,  changed its meeting styles to encourage equal participation and greater collaboration ,  and introduced  new innovation team with an unusual mandate: Under absolutely no circumstances should the innovation team innovate 


-  Instead ,  the teams mission is to enable the broader community to incorporate the behaviors that enable successful innovation 


- 11 ,  To see these lies for what they are and successfully transform their organizations ,  leaders first need to transform themselves 


-  Successfully responding to disruption requires executives to simultaneously reinvent todays business while creating tomorrows business 


-  More specifically ,  they have to find new ways to solve customer problems while at the same time scoping out new growth opportunities 


-  The challenge isnt just that these missions are in conflict and involve periods of chaos and uncertainty; it also is that they require fundamentally different mindsets and approaches 


-  ,  Research by longtime Harvard professor Robert Kegan found that most leaders lack the cognitive flexibility required to toggle between being disciplined and entrepreneurial 


-  Kegan terms this flexibility self-transforming ,  where leaders have the ability to step back from and reflect on the limits of our own ideology or personal authority; see that any one system or self-organization is in some way partial or incomplete; be friendlier toward contradiction and opposites; [and] seek to hold on to multiple systems rather than project all except one onto the other 


- 13 ,  Its not surprising that so many leaders lack this capability 


-  Most grew up in  world that was either disciplined or entrepreneurial but rarely both and almost never both at the same time 


-  To transform themselves ,  leaders must focus more on mindsets ,  awareness ,  and inner capacities to combat basic biases that make it hard to make decisions in uncertainty and toggle between different frames 


-  More critical ,  and for our purposes here ,  mindfulness boosts awareness ,  increasing  persons ability to step back ,  pause ,  and become aware of not just habitual thought patterns ,  but also emotional reactions 


- 14 ,  Mindful leaders can ,  for example ,  see their reactivity ,  giving them the tools to identify and overcome the deceptions of disruption 


-   mindful leader is better at toggling between different mindsets:  disciplined focus on transforming todays business and more entrepreneurial thinking to create tomorrows business 


-  Mindfulness is  powerful ,  scientifically validated tool for improving self-awareness ,  which is  critical and underappreciated tool for senior leaders confronting the challenges of disruptive change 


-  ,  Some leaders who have successfully managed transformative change have touted the value of mindfulness 


- 15 ,  Another example of the power of mindfulness comes from Pierre Wack ,  who advanced and popularized the idea of scenario planning while working at Royal Dutch Shell in the 1970s and 1980s 


-  Successful scenario planning ,  Wack noted ,  requires being in the right state of focus to put your finger unerringly on the key facts or insights that unlock or open understanding 


- 16 He noted that the value of scenario planning is not about developing specific plans that will actually be implemented or getting to the right scenario but about helping leadership understand that the future can be dramatically different from the present ,  while fostering  deeper understanding of the forces driving potential changes and uncertainties 


-  The approach ,  he said ,  gives managers something very precious: the ability to reperceive reality 


- 17 By sharpening his ability to toggle between present reality and future possibility ,  Wack and his team transformed scenario planning from  passive manipulation of data into an active tool to stretch thinking and advance discussions 


-  This helped Shell to see what others missed and weather oil shocks in the 1970s and 1980s significantly better than its competitors 


-  For example ,   


-  Lafley drove substantial change at Procter  Gamble as CEO from 2000 to 2009 ,  but the company stumbled so badly when he stepped down that he was asked to return 


-  Lou Gerstner was an icon for transformation during his time at IBM ,  but by the time Sam Palmisano turned the CEO reins over to Ginni Rometty ,  IBM had missed the cloud computing revolution and its touted Watson platform was struggling to deliver results commensurate with its hype 


-  Single-shot leaders might have the personal ability to toggle between different mindsets ,  but they seem to struggle to codify core elements of their unique approach and institutionalize them 


-  ,  Kegan and coauthor Lisa Laskow Lahey noted in An Everyone Culture that you can create  deliberately developmental organization  ( DDO )  that consciously upgrades an entire organizations capacity to grapple with disruption 


-  Bridgewater ,  the worlds largest hedge fund ,  is  good example 


-  Some of the fundamental principles include radical transparency ,  where the goal is to review people accurately ,  not kindly; recognizing that internal exploration and struggle is important  ( pain  reflection  progress )  and sharing and supporting project work with complete transparency 


-  Bridgewater gives employee feedback not just to boost short-term performance but to enhance long-term capacity 


-  It consciously helps its employees develop reflective muscles to understand defensive routines and blind spots and to improve their ability to acquire ,  process ,  and make sense of multiple forms of data 


-  This commitment to developing everyones sense-making capacity as  mission-critical component of long-term performance sets DDOs like Bridgewater apart 


-  ,  Two final examples worth mentioning for their transformative efforts are SAP and Johnson  Johnson ,  which are helping staff develop creatively ,  emotionally ,  and mentally to tackle larger challenges such as disruption 


-  Recent efforts center on energy and performance ,  with  stated goal to help employees achieve full engagement in work and life 


-  Leaders serve as active role models for building these capabilities 


-  CEO Alex Gorsky ,  for example ,  has long worn  fitness tracker and speaks publicly about the link between mental well-being and productivity 


- 19 ,  In the first two decades of the 21st century ,  scholars and practitioners fine-tuned the technical solution to the dilemma of disruption 


-  It is high time for that community to more fully define  human solution  one that starts with senior leadership and carries through an entire organization
