-  It is so difficult that one scholar ,  Andrew Campbell ,  has argued in  recent debate inEuropean Business Forum against even trying to develop  strategic leadership discipline for dealing with internal corporate venturing as  dynamic internal force 


-  If ,  however ,  the prospects of the mainstream businesses are sufficient to meet the companys profitable growth objectives ,  there is little motivation to support ICV actively ,  and top management is more likely to pay lip service to it 


-  ,  If there are few uncommitted financial resources available ,  but the prospects of the mainstream businesses at the moment look sufficiently promising ,  top management is likely to consider ICV largely irrelevant 


-  ,   lack of uncommitted financial resources combined with  mainstream business with inadequate growth prospects is likely to lead top managers to latch on desperately to the first reasonable-looking ICV project that comes their way 


-  But if corporate venturing programs are typically closed before they have had  chance to prove themselves ,  other reasons than mere performance must be involved 


-  In general ,  these findings suggest that both top management and the executives involved in the ICV program fail to appreciate the role of ICV in  companys corporate strategy 


- 23 ODD developed innovative strategies ,  worked with business units to think of future scenarios ,  networked with many external experts ,  and ignited  grassroots movement of some 400 people 


-   more important reason was that management found it difficult to accept that the group was taking credit for strategy making ,  something that was considered  top-management responsibility and privilege 


-  ,  The combination of such administrative issues with  general lack of understanding of the role of ICV programs in long-term corporate-development strategy may lead to what game theorists call weakness of will 


- 25 That is one reason resistance to innovation is likely to be stronger within an established organization than support for it 


- 29 Realizing that ICV activity is actually hard to stamp out completely may increase top managements motivation to manage it better 


-  This is often the case in companies in Situation  ,  in which orphan ICV initiatives find it difficult to get senior management support ,  and even sometimes in Situation  ,  where the ICV initiatives that are likely to emerge are considered irrelevant 


-  By the time Bendix realized that electronic fuel injection would be  big opportunity and rushed to pursue it ,  it was too late ,  given the time remaining on its patents ,  to establish  position of market leadership 


- 35 ,  Even when not needed to support profitable growth objectives at  particular moment in time ,  ICV activity can be an important indicator of where the companys employees think future opportunities lie 


-  Management should try to understand what is so motivating and promising that people are willing to work on it ,  often after regular working hours or on weekends 


-  Currently ,  through its New Ventures organization ,  UPM is dedicated to exploring new areas in which the company has materials and manufacturing know-how ,  such as printed electronics ,  nanotechnology ,  smart labels and chemical indicators 


- 43 We should perhaps not be surprised that few companies have been successful in developing such  capability because the strategic leadership skills that are required to effectively explore and develop ill-defined and uncertain new-venture opportunities are different from those required to exploit well-defined and incremental core-business opportunities
