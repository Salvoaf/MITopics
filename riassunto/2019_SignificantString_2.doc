-  Conductors use them to establish tempo and feel ,  and to provide guidance on how to interpret the written rhythms  the patterns of sound and silence  that the ensemble is about to play 


-  Organizations now have  treasure chest of digital tools for collaboration  Slack ,  Teams/Skype ,  Chatter ,  Yammer ,  Jive ,  Zoom ,  Webex ,  Klaxoon  that they didnt have before 


-  )  Add to that email ,  texting ,  and messaging ,  along with the meetings that havent gone away ,  and the math is telling: Research shows that executives spend an average of nearly 23 hours per week in meetings  ( up from less than 10 hours 50 years ago )  ,  while McKinsey estimates the average knowledge worker spends 65% of the workday collaborating and communicating with others  ( including 28% of the day on email )  


-  ,  Indeed ,  given how hyperconnected most people are now at work ,  one might question whether they even have  rhythm of collaboration ,  not because they lack sufficient interaction  ( sound )  but because they lack any absence of it  ( silence )  


-  As collaborative tools make interaction cheaper and more abundant ,  opportunities to think without interaction are becoming more expensive and scarce ,  yet they remain critical 


-  In fact ,  our research shows that when people trade  rhythm of on-and-off collaboration for always-on connectivity ,  they coordinate and gather information more effectively ,  but they produce less innovative ,  less productive solutions 


-  In other words ,  weve designed organizational communication to make it harder ,  not easier ,  for human beings to do what were being told we need to do in the next decade or two  that is ,  differentiate our capabilities from the growing capacities of big data ,  automation ,  and AI 


-  ,  When we solve problems collaboratively  whether were making strategic decisions ,  fixing operational glitches ,  or generating ideas  we engage in two categories of actions:  (  )  gathering the facts we need to generate and develop various potential solutions ,  and  (  )  figuring out the best solutions 


-  Even among studies of collaboration ,  few have looked into how much we want to have 


-  ,  So we headed to the laboratory to explore that question 


-  ,  We found that connectivity had different effects on the fact-finding and figuring stages of problem-solving 


-  For finding facts ,  more connectivity was better ,  without limitation 


-  But figuring out what to do with those facts  actually creating the solutions  was undermined by too much connectedness 


-  If we were to describe this trade-off more generically ,  it is the question of whether the task primarily requires coordination or imagination 


-  If there are acute coordination needs  ( for instance ,  avoiding redundant effort by ensuring we dont all look under the same pillow for the keys )  ,  then always-on connectivity is helpful 


-  If imagination is more critical ,  then always-on connectivity can make it nearly impossible to manage the creativity of multiple minds ,  which requires  balance between allowing those minds to learn from one another and enhancing the capacity of each one to generate fresh ideas 


-  Too much communication ,  and all the minds end up in the same place ,  focusing on the same types of solutions 


-  ,  Does that have to be the case? Do organizations and teams need to choose between being great at fact-finding and being great at figuring? ,  To further investigate ,  we returned to the laboratory ,  this time with the goal of directly asking whether deliberately choosing  rhythm of collaboration  ( that isnt always on )  could help 


-  Each person was given  map with the locations of 25 fictional cities that they needed to visit 


-  ,  For decades ,  academics have been using the traveling salesperson problem to study complex problem-solving ,  in part because the set of all possible solutions forms what is called  rugged solution landscape: If you were to visualize all options as paths up  mountain  ( where the altitude reached is the measure of success )  ,  getting from  good solution to  better one might require you to hike back down the mountain and climb  very different path 


-  ,  Learning was  key factor: During periods of separation ,  people naturally struck out on their own and tried new and diverse approaches to the problem  but when they came together again ,  they could learn from these different solutions 


-  In this sense ,  intermittent interaction created the conditions for collective intelligence ,  rather than relying on  few leading individuals to come up with the strongest ideas 


-  ,  Flicking the collaboration light switch is something that leaders are uniquely positioned to do ,  because several obstacles stand in the way of people voluntarily working alone 


-  Individuals dont want to be  or appear to be  isolated 


-  For another ,  knowing what their teammates are doing provides  sense of comfort and security ,  because people can adjust their own behavior to be in sync with the group 


-  Its risky to go off on their own to try something new that will probably not be successful right from the start 


-  But even though it feels reassuring for individuals to be hyperconnected ,  its better for the organization if they periodically go off and think for themselves and generate diverse  if not quite mature  ideas 


-  Cathy Engelbert said she realized how closely people watch leaders for cues when an employee leaving the company  ( someone she didnt even know )  said that she didnt want to be like Cathy Engelbert ,  working and available to interact with colleagues at all hours 


-  But it also signals an end to collaboration and  start to individual time ,  something cherished at  company that depends so heavily on creativity 


-  One of the most seminal academic studies of work time in the 1990s showed how  software engineering team could reduce their feelings of having  time famine and improve productivity by instituting  policy of mandated quiet time ,  when interruptions were prohibited 


-  Plus ,  just because  team is sprinting doesnt mean others in the organization wont interrupt individual members of the team with collaboration needs that have nothing to do with the sprint 


-  Because they are often organization-wide events  or at least everyone in the organization tends to know about them  they are somewhat more immune to interruption by colleagues ,  especially when they are sponsored by senior leaders  ( which provides implicit permission for out-of-office auto replies )  


-  ,  Executives have been counseled to be collaborative leaders and to set the example at the top that they want to see in the rest of the organization 


-  For example ,  Microsoft now offers two tools that use email ,  calendar ,  contacts ,  and other Office 365 data to provide insights about collaboration: MyAnalytics  ( for individuals )  reports on how responsive you are to collaborators emails  ( on average and with specific individuals )  ,  reminds you to book focus time before meetings take over ,  highlights the impact of your after-hours emails on others ,  and so on; and Workplace Analytics  ( for an organization )  uses the same data ,  anonymized ,  to shed light on overall collaboration trends 


-  Your device will remind you to make your collaboration more intermittent when your solutions seem to lack sufficient diversity and encourage you to come back together and learn from one another when enough diversity has been generated 


-  Under tremendous pressure from its user base ,  Slack soon changed its stance and created private channels ,  which now account for  majority of the collaboration in most work spaces 


-  It also created  status function that allows you to signal when you are offline for one of any number of reasons 


-  Matthieu Beucher ,  founder and CEO of Klaxoon ,  intentionally developed Klaxoon with this goal in mind ,  because meetings themselves can be sources of intermittent interaction 


-  They then select an activity  ( brainstorm ,  poll ,  questions ,  decisions ,  and so on )  that supports the groups immediate task or objective 


-  For this approach to come into its own ,  however ,  we need to know more than we do today 


-  So culture becomes  critical reinforcing factor 


-  Unless individuals feel safe to intermittently disconnect and see that behavior modeled and rewarded by the leaders around them ,  theyre more likely to stay too connected ,  no matter what their managers say they expect and what kinds of tools and opportunities they provide
