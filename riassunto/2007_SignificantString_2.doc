-  Studies suggest that an inability to deliver on critical projects is  primary reason for this alarming rate of dismissals 


-  However ,  while these new approaches have somewhat improved results ,  with more than two out of three projects continuing to disappoint ,  clearly something is still missing 


-  Our research shows that most projects fail for reasons that are widely perceived and that the failures can be both predicted and prevented with surprising reliability 


-  ,   vexing problem reported by 85% of project participants is something we call fact-free planning 


-  Project leaders under pressure from various stakeholders determine deadlines ,  scope ,  deliverables and budget with little or no regard for the hard facts about what will actually be required 


-  At other times ,  they base their estimates on facts ,  only to have the estimates ignored 


-  The problem is that fewer than one in seven people who are afflicted by fact-free planning are able to succeed at this very crucial conversation 


-  Over time ,  teams that suffer from these mindless demands begin to exaggerate when they are asked for project estimates 


-  When project managers realize it is taking place ,  they must be willing and able to call the bluff 


-  If they avoid this crucial conversation and either commit to something they know cant happen or pad their way to success ,  they set themselves and their projects up to fail 


-  ,  I went to my sponsor to explain why we couldnt get the job done with the budget and timeline hed set ,  says one manager 


-  Id calculated out exactly what wed need 


-  ,  Similarly ,  executives who drive fact-free planning are often avoiding crucial conversations 


-  Instead of discussing their doubts about an estimates validity or the teams competence ,  they use their power in  way that generatespolitical rather thanrational agreements 


-  Then ,  when failures follow ,  their doubts about theteam are confirmed ,  and they feel justified in their use of pressure to extract irrational commitments in the future 


-  ,  Project teams often need support and resources from leaders who are senior to them 


-  When one of these leaders fails to come through as required ,  the team may need to involve its sponsor 


-  ,  Our research shows that 65% of project managers regularly face problems with AWOL sponsors for  variety of reasons: Some sponsors just dont care about the project ,  some have no bandwidth ,  and some lack competence in the project area 


-  ,  But whatever the reason ,  the problem must be discussed if its to be resolved 


-  In fact ,  11% come in more than  million dollars over budget 


-  They need what they need and dont want to be burdened with practical considerations 


-  As  real simple example ,  offers one executive ,  somebody might be walking with me to the coffee machine and they start talking about something 


-   have to stop and say ,  You realize this is just  conversation  that you did not just initiate  project 


-  Project participants often fail to admit they may fall short on deliverables and need more time ,  instead hoping that some other group that has problems will speak up first 


-  These functional managers often have many other priorities and are unresponsive to the project leaders needs 


-  This meant that customers calling to question or complain about bills often either were kept on hold for unacceptably long periods of time ,  or their calls were terminated with their problems unsolved 


-  And to make matters worse ,  all of this was taking place amid regular corporate downsizing announcements that hammered already sagging morale 


-  He also demonstrated his commitment to candid dialogue about anything standing in the way of improvement 


-  In spite of the fact that billions of dollars were spent in the form of strategic projects every year ,  only  handful could tell us what percentage performed to specifications 


-  And unlike most attempts to measure soft factors ,  these data were captured once every four months 


-  ODea reasoned that ,  in order to sustain leadership attention ,  the measure would have to be refreshed much more frequently 


-  Also ,  in order to allow leaders to test whether their interventions were changing behavior ,  they needed to compress the learning cycle from once  year to three times  year 


-  Unwanted turnover dropped 


-  That means ensuring that people have easy access to leaders and other stakeholders with whom they need to have these crucial conversations 


-  ,  In addition ,  as these opinion leaders returned to their functions and reported informally to peers about their positive experiences with raising tough issues with upper management ,  trust blossomed 


-  The investment of time and attention in opinion leaders experiences was leveraged over and over as those they shared their experiences with took greater risks to raise crucial issues they previously would not have raised 


-  Since ODea had done so much to socialize the need for greater dialogue ,  and since managers up and down the chain of command were being held accountable for measurable improvement in these behaviors ,  the skip level sessions became  natural and acceptable method for achieving the shared goal 


-  The real audience for his next few words ,  he recalled afterward ,  was not just the engineer ,  it was the other 15 opinion leaders in the room who were riveted to ODea to read his reaction 


-  We have ,  in fact ,  heard you ,  but weve given no feedback 


-  ,  The conversation that followed helped the opinion leaders understand that ODea faced many tradeoffs and that the risks they had raised were only one set of considerations 


-  In actuality ,  however ,  these considerations prove not to be problems 


-  ,  First of all ,  in successful companies ,  leaders quickly begin to understand that this is not extra work 


-  In fact ,  the primary job of  leader should be to influence behavior 


-  The reason ,  we found ,  was that after having taught ,  the leaders felt  special responsibility to point out opportunities in real time when their direct reports could apply skills from  previous lesson 


-  ,  People need to feel personally committed to changing behavior 


-  They need to see the moral imperative implicit in the changes 


-  As leaders at Sprint worked to make the case for change ,  they helped people see how the quality of their work ,  pride in achievement and desire to make  difference were bound up in changing how they dealt with the five crucial conversations 


-  They also need to see that those who dont change are held accountable 


-  At Sprint ,  the fact that leaders did the teaching sent  loud social message and enlisted leaders in creating social support 


-  ,  People also need help ,  coaching ,  permission ,  authority and other socially provided enablers in order to beable to change 


-  At Sprint ,  ODea and his team gave people the access they needed to be able to hold the crucial conversations they were being asked to have 


-  ODeas group frequently gathered and disseminated data to keep the crucial conversations front and center in peoples minds
