- Over the last decade ,  the Internet has transformed many aspects of the way business is conducted  from how goods are bought and sold to where work is done 


-  To explore what might constitute the next generation of Web technologies and what effect they will have on the nature ,  purpose and management of organizations ,  MIT Sloan Management Review contributing editor Martha  


-  McAfee ,  associate professor of business administration in the Technology and Operations Management Unit at Harvard Business School 


-  ,  Looking ahead to the next year or two ,  what do you think are some of the most important ways in which the Web  and in particular so-called Web  


-  technologies  will continue to change the way business is done? ,  Brynjolfsson:  expect  big thematic change in the way people have been using the technology 


-  Because of the recession in 20012002 and really ,  frankly ,  some overspending in the late 90s ,  there was for several years  focus within corporations on cost-cutting and using the Internet to save money ,  gain efficiencies and improve productivity 


-  technology to support innovation ,  creativity ,  collaboration and information sharing 


-  When it comes to what CIOs are asked to focus on ,  theres  bit of  cycle that parallels the business cycle 


-  Going forward over the next year or two ,   see  focus on using the Web to grow revenues and foster innovation  as opposed to  focus on cutting costs 


-  There are several trends going on  some of which have been going on for some time ,  some of which have started to accelerate recently  that support this flowering of collaboration and innovation and creativity that we are seeing on the Web 


-  One trend is that the cost of participating on the Web continues to plummet 


-  Processing ,  bandwidth ,  storage and memory all just continue to get cheaper and cheaper 


-  Its also getting  lot less expensive to contribute to the Web or to build an industrial-strength Web site 


-  ,  In addition ,  expertise barriers to putting content on the Web have basically vanished 


-  If you get  Blogger account ,  you dont need even basic HTML skills to start getting your thoughts up on the Web 


-  Anyone with an Internet connection can play on the Web in all the ways they want to now 


-  And that contributes to this flowering of innovation and creativity 


-  For example ,  you dont have to be  climate change expert to edit the Wikipedia entry on global warming ,  but maybe Wikipedia would be better if people focused on areas where they had something to contribute 


-  ,  We need innovation not just in the technology but innovation in some of the institutions that manage the collaboration and that manage  global community working on problems 


-  The question is: Is there  way that we can create an institution or  set of institutions where the right answers emerge consistently from collaborative efforts? ,  McAfee: We dont have  lot of experience with how to do that 


-  Were used to the forms of organization weve had for  long time 


-  The Web  this worldwide ,  zeroincremental cost network that weve built  gives us  lot of opportunities 


-  ,  Im not saying that the complete level playing field that the Internet makes possible is  great idea in all cases 


-  But the business opportunity it presents is to create the architecture of participation  the ground rules of the game  so that the good material emerges 


-  ,  One place where weve seen Internet-based collaboration work effectively is open-source software development 


-  Is that an interesting model for how this type of collaboration might play out in other industries? ,  Brynjolfsson: Its very interesting and its an example of  broader phenomenon that has sometimes been called the gift economy 


-  There are  lot of knowledge workers who contribute what they have to offer not necessarily for purely financial motives but because of  whole set of motivations psychologists can tell you we all have 


- com or some of the travel sites 


-  ,  McAfee: What were seeing is just how deep-rooted that desire is to do several things: to share ,  to communicate ,  to get your expertise out there and to do what Ward Cunningham ,  who invented wiki technology ,  called authoring 


-  ,  Lets talk  little bit about the process of how the good material  good content ,  good ideas  can filter up 


-  ,  McAfee: When  talk to corporate audiences ,   usually start with the technological mechanisms that let good stuff emerge 


-  If you let people author Web content and you let them interlink ,  the cream is going to rise to the top in  sense; the most popular content is going to be very evident very quickly 


-  You have great incentive to be helpful ,  rather than harmful ,  if you want your contributions to last 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: The examples Andy is giving are examples of  broader phenomenon that Tom Malone ,  my colleague at the MIT Sloan School ,  is calling collective intelligence 


-  Malone recently founded the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence to try to understand the common themes between iniatives like Wikipedia and Google 


-  He points out that its not just that Google has  clever search algorithm and some powerful servers; its that theres  tremendous amount of structure in the Web itself that people create every time they add  link to one of their pages 


-  That collective intelligence is what Google leverages so effectively 


-  tools within their organizations? ,  McAfee: The first piece of advice Id give is that you might want to rethink your infrastructure for collaboration and communication 


-  ,  Which technologies ,  specifically ,  do you think are the low-hanging fruit for corporate executives to consider? ,  McAfee: The ones that  try to get managers excited about these days are those that let people express the desire they have to contribute or publish for  broad audience 


-  These are low-risk ,  low-cost experiments 


-  technologies within  corporation could be described as if we build it ,  they will come 


-  infrastructure ,  then youre going to get great emergent phenomenon  an internal Google-level search and  Wikipedia-level internal collaboration environment 


-  The main reason that doesnt happen is that the number of people who are actually contributing content to the Web  as opposed to passively consuming it  is  tiny ,  tiny percentage of all Web users 


-  You scale that down to enterprise size ,  and theres essentially no one participating in what  call the Enterprise  


-  tools within companies 


-  The managers job is to increase the ambient level of participation in and contribution to these Enterprise  


-  ,  How do you go about doing that? ,  McAfee: The economists would say you provide incentives to do it  whether hard or soft incentives ,  cultural ones or monetary ones 


-  One of the simplest and most effective techniques Ive seen  and Ive seen it over and over  is for  boss to just say ,  Im not reading any e-mails about this project; put all your information up on the wiki where we can all see it and use it 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: Paradoxically ,  some of the most powerful incentives can be created when you simply take away undue structure and constraints 


-  Youre also going to see  lot more potentially useful connections emerge organically 


-  ,  This doesnt come costlessly 


-  One of the benefits of the organization of  corporation is the potential for streamlining and efficiency that hierarchy brings to bear 


-  Ultimately ,  its  trade-off in terms of where you want to be on that creativity vs 


-  The nice thing is that innovations in technology and in organizational design are allowing us to push out the frontier of that trade-off ,  so that you can get more innovation without sacrificing efficiency to the same degree 


-  ,  McAfee:  dont think Erik believes ,  and  certainly dont believe ,  that everyone should abandon hierarchy and abandon any element of command and control inside an organization 


-  An existing company can take advantage of both the benefits of imposing structure and hierarchy and some level of managerial intervention while simultaneously getting out of the way in other areas and letting the lateralization and the diagonal innovation emerge 


-  And  dont think that its naive to expect that both of these phenomena can happen  just as its not naive for an organization to have an ERP [Enterprise Resource Planning] system and  wiki at the same time 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: In fact ,   think  lot of the ERP systems and the process-management tools that are often considered to be antithetical to wikis can be very complementary or synergistic with the collaborative tools 


-  Andy and  are working on  paper now called Scale Without Mass that looks at how you can leverage creativity and new ideas through business process replication by using tools like ERP and CRM [customer relationship management] 


-  The idea is that when somebody comes up with an innovation ,  you can use these process-management tools to much more rapidly replicate and disseminate the new ideas throughout the company on  global basis 


-  There are  number of examples of companies doing that 


-  That is  good example of this trade-off between innovation and efficiency being much less severe than it used to be 


-  ,  McAfee: Weve got one set of tools that allow the good ideas to percolate up to the top ,  and then you can use these very structured process-management technologies to replicate the innovation 


-  One way to think about managers role in this era is that they grab the good ideas that percolate up and then propagate them throughout the organization  with brutal efficiency in some cases 


-  Can you give some examples of that phenomenon? ,  Brynjolfsson: When Amazon comes up with  better shopping experience for its customers ,  the improvement may involve changing  few lines of code or rearranging of some pixels  and ,  instantly ,  millions of people have  new shopping experience on each of their desktops ,  all over the world 


-  Amazon is constantly doing experiments to see if the company can improve the shopping experience by  few tenths of  percent in terms of the yield and efficiency 


-  At  Web-based company ,  its pretty easy to see how creativity can be quickly leveraged to millions of store locations ,  if you will 


-  The same thing is true for software firms or other companies that replicate their products and services digitally 


-  CVS improved its business process for ordering prescription drugs and then ,  within the course of  year ,  replicated the improvement at more than  , 000 retail locations 


-  Thats something that wouldnt have been doable before firms had  technology platform already in place for implementing and disseminating the innovation 


-  ,  In the CVS case ,  did that innovation come about through the use of Web  


-  collaborative technologies? ,  McAfee: That particular innovation at CVS came from  cross-functional team brought together to solve  problem 


-  What were seeing more generally ,  though ,  is that  lot of clever ideas now are percolating up via some combination of people and technology  and then theyre propagated throughout the organization 


-  Companies in very turbulent ,  very information-intensive industries tend to be the ones that have gone the furthest with deploying the new Enterprise  


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: In addition to structural changes ,  there are also some softer ,  cultural things that companies can do 


-  Google ,  for example ,  has  norm that all employees are supposed to spend about 10% of their time on new ideas that arent related to Googles main products 


-  The company gives employees remarkable freedom as to how unrelated those projects and ideas can be 


-  Thats something that Google can afford to do in part because the company has been successful ,  so  real test would be whether  company that didnt have margins like Googles could afford to offer that kind of freedom 


-  ,  McAfee: Ive also talked to  few different professional services firms about the Enterprise  


-  Like Google ,  those firms are also very successful ,  very high-margin businesses 


-  But the soft shift  the cultural shift for them  theyre finding difficult to execute ,  in part because their focus for so long has been on billable hours and on classic notions of productivity and output 


-  And  think that neither Erik nor  see any technology that will by itself resolve that dilemma 


-  ,  One of the things that  find interesting about these technologies is that you can draw the boundaries around them wherever you want 


-  Use them purely for one lab or one work group  great 


-  Or use them companywide  great 


-  Include all of your customers ,  suppliers and users  great 


-  With these technologies ,  you can very easily select the scale of community you want 


-  ,  My colleague Karim Lakhani and  are writing  case study right now about Cambrian House Inc 


-  ,   software development company based in Calgary ,  Alberta ,  thats drawing the boundary very widely 


-  The company leaders have stopped saying they know what software they should develop next 


-  The company commits to at least test the products that win  to build them to the point where the company can see whether the products will succeed in the market 


-  Cambrian House will give each months tournament winners some share of any future profits on that software product 


-  The company also partitions out the coding tasks not only to its own employees but also to the community of people who know about the company and come to its site; the company offers these outside coders  share of the products profits 


-  Cambrian House is partially outsourcing both idea generation for new products and then product creation 


-  What the company does is sit in the middle ,  coordinate all those activities ,  get the software to market and then partition out the proceeds that result 


-  ,  So theyve essentially viewed their core competency as managing their community 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: In general ,  the whole concept of internal and external [to the corporation] is becoming  lot blurrier 


-  And thats again ,  partly ,  because of these kinds of tools 


-  Part of this goes back to the basic economics about what it means to be an employee 


-  For example ,  its difficult for an assembly-line worker at General Motors to create value at home ,  without access to the companys capital equipment 


-  But 150 years ago ,  craft workers did work with their own capital ,  and they had  lot more autonomy and independence 


-  Today ,  in many ways were coming back to that type of arrangement ,  where knowledge workers ,  who work with their own human capital and perhaps access to the companys technology infrastructure that they can easily get from home ,  can create  tremendous amount of value for  company 


-  Employee/independent contractor distinctions are less relevant for that kind of worker and that kind of firm 


-  ,  The traditional corporate organization was tremendously successful throughout the 20th century 


-  But ,  as we said at the outset ,  the technology innovations are engendering  whole set of complementary innovations in organizations 


-  ,  McAfee: Some people who get really enthusiastic about the new Web technologies say that they render managers obsolete ,  or that we are going to have  completely self-organizing economy 


-  But what were saying is that we find that these changes actually heighten the role of managers and executives ,  who need to think about how to organize and compete in the new environment 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: Its not  question of complete decentralization or complete centralization 


-  Instead ,  we see companies simultaneously using centralization and decentralization in different aspects of their businesses 


-  Ive learned  lot from Andys case study about Zara ,  the fashion retailer that is part of the Inditex Group ,  based in  Corua ,  Spain 


-  Zaras example highlights how even  light touch of technology can radically change the way  company or an industry works 


-  ,  McAfee: Erik and  both find Zara  really interesting company 


-  In  very vertically disintegrated industry  apparel manufacturing and retailing  where everyone else outsources to low-wage countries ,  Zara is very vertically integrated 


-  The company controls warehouses ,  cutting facilities and distribution centers and owns its stores 


-  Zaras management pursues that strategy because they want the company to be fast ,  and they want to react to changing fashion trends in  couple of weeks  as opposed to in six months 


-  In particular ,  Zara has decentralized decisions about which clothes should be in each store 


-  Headquarters decides what goods are available ,  in what quantities and at what price ,  and transmits this information to all the stores twice  week 


-  The stores then decide what they actually want and use the same technology to transmit those decisions to headquarters ,  where the decisions are all added up 


-  Theres this constant back and forth of information that helps the designers at Zara come up with the right new models and then get them into the right stores 


-  ,  Its clearly another form of collective intelligence 


-  While many companies in Zaras industry rely on very sophisticated software ,  genius designers or marketing to forecast or create demand ,  Zara does essentially none of that 


-  The company in effect says ,  Store managers ,  you tell us what people are going to wear for the next few weeks; then well build it and get it to you 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: This example highlights  trade-off between local and central knowledge that exists in every industry 


-  And technology is allowing companies to move that knowledge back and forth much more rapidly 


-  In Zaras case ,  those local store managers have on-the-spot information that would be impossible for someone at headquarters to really understand 


-  Its even almost impossible for the local store managers to communicate it ,  because theres so much subtlety to it 


-  On the other hand ,  what can be communicated pretty easily are production schedules and availability 


-  If its qualitative ,  is it distributed? Does it have to remain distributed? The new technology toolkit gives managers  lot of options for thinking through that golden rule 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: In many dimensions ,  its very difficult to make predictions about the next five years 


-  But the technology side is oddly predictable 


-  Were quite confident that were going to have  continuation of Moores Law on the processor side and comparable improvements in memory ,  communications speed and storage 


-  That means that the bottleneck  the real place where theres room to make excess returns if youre an entrepreneur or  manager or  venture capitalist  is in finding creative ways to use those technologies 


-  Bank on  tenfold improvement in the next five years in most of those technologies  just mentioned 


-  Now ask yourself: What will you be able to do differently given that tenfold improvement in cost or capability? ,  We are very far from exploiting the full potential of the technology 


-  The set of technologies we have floating around today are fodder for at least  decade or two worth of organizational innovations  let alone the tenfold improvements were going to see in the next five years
