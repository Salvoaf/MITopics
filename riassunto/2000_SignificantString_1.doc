-  ,  First ,  consider the pharmaceutical industry ,  where independent biotechnology research adds 100 gigabytes per day to the databases of the GenBank alone  ( the National Institutes of Health genetic sequence database ,  an annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences )  


-  ,  Next ,  consider both the large services industries ,  where most innovations are dependent on software ,  and the manufacturing world ,  which increasingly relies on embedded electronics 


-  It invests heavily only in its core competencies  ( understanding customer needs ,  logistics and component integration )  and wherever it sees  unique opportunity for adding value 


-  Dell has chosen to out-source component production and innovation ,  keeping component integration ,  logistics and customer understanding as in-house core competencies 


-  ,  As  component supplier ,  Intel avoids end-product production and concentrates investments and formidable development capabilities on its specialized competencies 


-  Even Europe is beginning to exploit the opportunities ,  with the European Airbus integrators tapping into worldwide component-innovation sources to change the entire performance position of Airbus 


-  One of Enrons innovations involves first offering internal divisions stabilized energy costs through its sophisticated energy-industry knowledge ,  financial modeling and risk-sharing capabilities; and second ,  pricing energy on  per-unit basis  ( per room in hotels ,  per linear foot of production in manufacturing or per square foot in offices )  to fit the specific strategic cost-control needs of each division 


-  Under stress in  tight labor market ,  RBS wanted to shift its benefits package rapidly toward  new approach that would attract and retain highly qualified people 


-  Hay works with its clients in workshops to understand as clearly as possible each partys needs ,  desires and worst fears 


-  Leading professional outsourcers  real estate ,  human relations ,  software systems or financial firms  are just as likely to come up with major innovations as specialized technical-research or product-design houses are 


-  Software systems based on customer inputs  ( such as Kaos Echo )  or interactive design software  ( Aavids Fluent for flow-process design or CAVE for large-scale equipment demonstrations )  help innovative suppliers understand customer issues in detail ,  lower the risk of creating  new product or process that will fail ,  assist clients in understanding and preparing for innovation ,  transfer knowledge smoothly to them and provide the necessary comfort level to ensure use of the product 


-  With more innovators involved and critiquing ideas through interactive software ,  the company can decrease its performance and market risks ,  increase the probability of successful innovation and obtain valuable product-performance insights that otherwise might not surface 


-  ,  For example ,  Chrysler Corporation has standard contract clauses that specify continuous ,  measurable performance-improvement levels beyond current targets in each year of  contracts life 


-  ,  It is important that both parties agree on specific performance targets that are fair ,  few in number ,  easy to understand and readily usable by the people doing the work 


-  Although clients generally want an out-source provider to innovate and keep its operations at state-of-the-art levels ,  they may insist unrealistically that suppliers pass all gains from innovations to the buyer in their pricing ,  use the buyers own practices to ensure consistency and quality and bill professional inputs on an hourly basis instead of using value pricing or jointly shared innovation incentives 


-  The highly successful CEO of  $4 billion out-sourcing company has suggested  wiser approach ,  saying ,  To encourage innovation ,   wont worry about how much the provider makes from the transaction[but]  will constantly want to know how our relationship with the provider is making us more money than we would otherwise 


-  From that group ,   final marketplace test will indicate which concepts should be commercialized ,  and profit- and risk-sharing incentives then take over
