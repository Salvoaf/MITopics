- To remain competitive over time ,   company must be able to move quickly in response to major changes in society ,  technology ,  competition ,  regulation ,  labor markets ,  and myriad other areas 


-  Yet the possibility of such changes creates deep uncertainty ,  making it challenging to identify the most profitable path forward 


-  Although organizations can never be fully prepared for an unanticipated shock ,  the most resilient ones learn to expect the unexpected ,  rebound quickly when it occurs ,  and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities that emerge 


-  ,  To help with those efforts ,  we have developed  framework that goes beyond traditional forecasting and risk-assessment exercises 


-  It consists of four sets of activities: First ,  develop  comprehensive set of processes to actively sense new insights  ( whether internal or external )  that could affect the business ,  and hence identify threats or opportunities as early as possible 


-  Second ,  organize in response to those threats or opportunities; this is likely to involve reallocating resources ,  revamping processes ,  filling capability gaps ,  and aligning the companys structure and governance 


-  Third ,  capture value by revising business models and restructuring relationships with other players in various ecosystems 


-  And fourth ,  renew the organizational capabilities needed to create and capture value by continuing to monitor and assess results and making small adjustments over time  while also preparing for the major disruptions that require  more comprehensive overhaul 


-  ,  This approach is based on the principle of dynamic capabilities ,  which holds that companies need to continually adapt their resources to respond to rapidly changing and unpredictable environments 


-  Dynamic-capabilities-based models are the subject of  large and growing body of strategic management literature 


-  Our framework synthesizes key lessons from this literature and provides  way forward for managers to revitalize their companys processes ,  structures ,  and business models  and to compete effectively  in  highly dynamic business environment 


-  ,   few decades ago ,  companies could build  strong business model and apply it more or less unchanged for years 


-  Consider that ,  in the early 1970s ,  nearly 80% of the most profitable publicly traded companies remained in the top quartile of performance for at least six years out of the previous 10 


-  Today ,  that is no longer true ,  as relentless innovation and disruption threaten established business models ,  leading to far greater churn among top performers in virtually all industries 


-  Resilience now depends on rapid and effective adaptation to change 


-  ,  Nokia is  good example of how change and unexpected competition can upend even highly successful businesses 


-  Founded in Finland in 1865 as  paper mill ,  the company later diversified and eventually became one of Europes leading electronics companies in the 1970s 


-  It introduced its first mobile phone in 1987 ,  and by the end of the 1990s it had become the largest cellphone manufacturer in the world 


-  But the company was overtaken by new competition from Apples iPhone and Googles Android mobile operating system 


-  By 2016 ,  Nokia was out of the phone business altogether  an extremely rapid reversal for  market leader 


-  ,  Contrast that with Netflix ,  which anticipated  large shift in technology and was thus able to adjust its strategy to capitalize on it 


-  In the early 2000s ,  Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings committed resources at the exclusively DVD-by-mail company to build  streaming service  well before home internet services had sufficient bandwidth to support it 


-  Netflix first offered streaming in 2007 as  free bonus to DVD renters and then ,  in 2011 ,  separated the DVD and streaming offerings 


-  Mail-order subscribers left in droves ,  yet it was the right realignment in response to changes in how people consumed media 


-  And it led to tremendous success for Netflix  its streaming business grew from 10 million subscribers in 2010 to over 160 million in 2020 


-  ,  Making such prescient moves requires  structured way of looking out over the horizon and anticipating whats coming 


-  Drawing on the rich vein of dynamic-capabilities thinking ,  we propose the following model 


-  Although most organizations have some sensing activities in place ,  they often lack  systematic approach to gathering and sharing critical information 


-  To successfully anticipate change ,  organizations must be designed for ,  and become accustomed to ,  gathering and sharing information from  wide range of sources ,  such as current and former customers ,  strategic partners ,  internal R&D staff ,  customer-facing employees ,  suppliers ,  local and regional stakeholders ,  university labs ,  boards of directors and advisers ,  trade media ,  and current and anticipated competitors 


-  Big data and machine learning techniques can be used to tease out insights from combinations of the internal and external data streams 


-  Therefore ,  organizational design must foster the free flow of information from gathering points to wherever it may be relevant  for example ,  by ensuring that visible processes and incentive systems encourage collaboration and interaction 


-  And when the future is particularly hard to read ,  leaders must distill insights by creating  range of scenarios and then developing ,  testing ,  and retesting hypotheses 


-  ,  These principles of sensing can be seen in action at Progressive ,  one of the largest auto insurers in the  


-  Progressive offers customers  mobile app called Snapshot that allows the company to capture billions of miles of driving data so it can provide finely segmented ,  usage-based rates 


-  It combines that information with data from the marketing ,  claims ,  and policy service departments in  repository that can be accessed by analysts and managers throughout the organization via  dashboard 


-  Progressive also created the Business Innovation Garage ,   secure space where any employee can rapidly prototype and test new offerings 


-  Leaders also need to build flexible structures and processes that enable the organization to innovate and embrace change 


-   key aspect of organizing is filling capability gaps that arise when  company enters  new market or revamps its business model 


-  ,  In the mid-1990s ,  Samsung committed to building  capability in industrial design  an effort that took several years and included opening  multidisciplinary in-house design institute along with design bureaus in Europe ,  the  


-  To maintain flexibility as products are developed ,  Samsung often has multiple design and engineering teams working on similar products and eventually launches the ones that are best suited to current market conditions 


-  Samsungs intentionally developed design capability and its skill at reallocating resources where needed were critical to the companys expansion into smartphones from its traditional base in home appliances and consumer electronics 


-  Despite  slow start in the smartphone sector  ( Samsungs first Android-based devices debuted in mid-2010 ,  three years after Apple launched the iPhone )  ,  the company quickly grew to dominate the worldwide smartphone market 


-  ,  The best approach to organizing will vary depending on  companys circumstances ,  but several principles are widely applicable 


-  For example ,  companies can often become more responsive and innovative by flattening management hierarchies and decentralizing decision-making authority 


-  However ,  when they decentralize ,  they need to find ways to keep people moving toward shared goals to prevent chaos 


-   companys culture  including its mission ,  values ,  and management style  can provide that sense of direction 


-  But that culture should be entrepreneurial rather than bureaucratic  for example ,  ensuring that small ,  early failures lead to learning rather than blaming 


-  As weve seen time and again ,  the most innovative organizations also are open to thoughtful criticism that forces the holders of the consensus view to sharpen  ( or ,  in some cases ,  abandon )  their thinking 


-  Capturing value requires leaders to execute strategic priorities by orchestrating their companys tangible and intangible assets  such as capital ,  strategic partnerships ,  and intellectual property  as well as making changes to business models as required 


-  Amazon ,  for example ,  developed proprietary technology infrastructure to enable its unprecedented scale advantage over competing online retailers 


-  It subsequently leveraged that very IT architecture in order to create  highly profitable cloud computing business ,  an operation that now funds many of its other strategic initiatives 


-  ,  Maximizing value capture also entails determining which activities can safely be outsourced and which ones must be retained in-house because they are critical to  companys product road map or value delivery system  ( or both )  


- 10 Finally ,  operating discipline is an important contributor to capturing and retaining value in the enterprise 


-  Sensing activities will inevitably call the wider status quo into question and will sometimes even require that companies overhaul their entire identity 


- 11 Yet for each of the successful renewals mentioned above ,  many other companies have failed to see themselves and their situations with fresh eyes ,  including Kodak ,  Blockbuster ,  and Yahoo ,  to name just  few 


- 12 ,  Renewal is best seen as  continuous endeavor 


-  Between major transitions ,  there is often value in tuning up the companys culture ,  organization ,  and routines 


-  That includes considering changes to incentive systems ,  reporting structures ,  decision-making ,  and business processes 


-  ,  Moreover ,  as these changes are made ,  they generate new data 


- 13 In that sense ,  this fourth component of the framework includes continually assessing results and revising the first three components 


-  ,  The four sets of activities and capabilities defined above  sensing ,  organizing ,  capturing ,  and renewing  are not meant to be implemented sequentially 


-  Rather ,  they are tightly interlinked; as information continuously flows back and forth ,  the underlying behaviors and processes should change accordingly 


-  More than any individual activity ,  managing the connections across all four areas enables an organization to become more resilient 


-  For example ,  feedback from activities that capture value ,  such as an unexpectedly poor monthly sales report ,  could trigger  greater focus on sensing activities  thereby leading the sales or engineering staffs to restructure their interactions with external partners and customers in order to seek feedback ,  test the validity of existing assumptions ,  and revise operating plans 


-  ,  Another key point is that these processes dont run on  specified timetable 


-  In any company with mature dynamic capabilities ,  sensing activities ,  for example ,  continually generate new insights ,  which must be processed quickly by leaders at the divisional or corporate level 


-  As new conjectures are tested and accepted or rejected ,  subsequent sets of activities to sense ,  organize ,  capture value ,  and/or renew should begin as soon as the evidence suggests theyre needed  not when the budget cycle creates an opening 


-  ,  One industry facing significant uncertainty is automobile manufacturing 


-  Carmakers are dealing with technology changes such as electrification and autonomy ,  new forms of competition from ride sharing ,  and regulatory changes 


-  Given those variables ,  the dynamic-capabilities model could be used by an incumbent auto manufacturer faced with the emergence of autonomous vehicle  ( AV )  technologies 


-  Large-scale investments are already being made by numerous competitors as well as new market entrants  ( including device makers and software developers )  ,  despite the lack of  clear path to profit 


-  ,  The dynamic and highly uncertain nature of AV ecosystems demands structured sensing activities to monitor changes in the landscape 


-  Market strategists from most organizations review relevant news sources ,  attend conferences ,  and engage outside experts 


-  If self-driving technology becomes standardized and universal ,  for example ,  car manufacturers may no longer compete on handling characteristics but rather on interior amenities such as infotainment packages or other custom features 


-  Disparate sources of information about new technologies ,  emerging business models ,  and tactics pursued by new and existing rivals must be assessed ,  calibrated ,  and integrated  and then distributed to the appropriate places where leaders can use that information to inform business model decisions and resource allocations 


-  It is essential to align both new and existing businesses within the companys strategy ,  structure ,  governance models ,  and critical processes 


-  ,  Perhaps the biggest issue facing automobile manufacturers is the need to formulate new potential business models to capture value  for example ,  considering whether to continue operating primarily as an OEM or expand into mobility as  service ,  short-term leasing ,  fleet management ,  or other services 


-  Another critical decision centers on the timing of market entry 


-   companys strategy ,  assets ,  and capabilities may position it to be  market pioneer ,  or they might suggest  less risky fast follower approach 


-  While AV technologies and ecosystems are still too embryonic for anything more than limited trials ,  working hypotheses about their rollout and about key bottleneck assets enable  company to decide which capabilities are needed in order to test its forecasts about the future 


-  Part of this involves determining which capabilities should be owned ,  contracted for ,  or leveraged through alliances   distribution that may change as the business ecosystem evolves 


-  Leaders must continually update future scenarios ,  consider the implications for corporate identity and mission ,  determine how best to fill missing-but-needed skill sets ,  and take proactive steps to shape new ecosystems as they emerge 


-  If an OEM concludes that AVs are critically important to the future of its industry ,  top management must frequently question their companys state of readiness  as well as continuously monitor the alignment of their underlying assumptions with signals generated from activities such as market trials and prototypes 


-  ,  In short ,  since the future is  moving target ,  leadership teams in this industry must anticipate multiple scenarios and develop the means to test them on  limited scale  with  keen eye toward organizational capabilities and skills gaps 


-  Participants must regularly update their estimated timelines for key technologies to be refined and introduced on  broad scale in order to provide reliable inputs into strategy formulation activities  since being too early to market is often just as costly as being too late 


-  If ,  for example ,  too many urban markets balk at implementing the infrastructure required for AVs to function safely ,  the current driver-based car culture could persist for decades to come 


-  Resilience requires  long-term ,  dogged commitment by the executive team to cultivate an innovative organizational culture and  mature set of dynamic organizational capabilities
