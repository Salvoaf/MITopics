-  Numerous books and articles have offered to solve the dilemma of disruption ,  including Christensens own The Innovators Solution  (  2003 book coauthored with Michael Raynor )  ,  which suggests that leaders who understand how disruption transpires can inoculate themselves against the threats and seize the opportunities 


-  This article explains these delusions about disruption and offers ways to help leaders avoid self-sabotage 


-  ,  Christensen and Raynor have done  superb job of creating  framework for helping to understand industry dynamics and for planning your own growth alternatives 


-  Or consider Netflix 


-  Netflix lacks the diverse portfolio these businesses have ,  and it may be overly focused on mainstream customers while ignoring the needs of less profitable ones ,  like all of those young people who prefer creating and sharing short-form videos on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok instead of watching shows like The Crown 


-  It is easy to be in the middle of  disruptive storm and take comfort in data suggesting everything is fine 


-  CEOs look at their dashboards and think they are OK ,  but they forget that they are looking in  rearview mirror 


-  Im sort of  poster child for not sort of doing anything but what we do every day 


-  But consider BlackBerrys performance at the time and over the next few years that followed 


-  Participants were given 20-page case studies highlighting potentially disruptive developments related to their industries 


-  I thought this was going to be the most boring event ever ,  admits Clark Gilbert ,  an HBS professor at the time and now president of BYU-Pathway Worldwide 


-  But something surprising transpired 


-  Its leadership identified an opportunity to drive step-change growth by ,  for the first time in its history ,  bypassing traditional distributors to deliver highly customized products directly to end consumers 


-  New Coke ,  Apples Newton ,  Microsofts Zune music player ,  Amazons Fire Phone ,  and Googles augmented reality glasses are all examples of big companies that made big bets that led to big write-offs 


-  When you win ,  you usually create not only an annuity but  new ecosystem that gives you the opportunity to win in new areas 


-  In the face of disruptive change ,  company leaders consistently invest too little ,  too slowly ,  in doing something different 


-  Indeed ,  many leaders hide behind the maximize shareholder value maxim without understanding exactly what it means 


-  Aetnas Bertolini recalled  tense meeting early on in the companys strategic transformation where he fielded questions from investment banking analysts: I walked into  room of analysts and  said ,  You either think of me as stupid or that Im lying to you ,  neither of which makes me want to spend more time with you 


-   have had shareholders who have said to me ,  Why dont you double your dividends? Well ,   want to invest in the company 


-  You need to find the leaders in the room who will be the ambassadors to the future 


-  The difficulty and pain of the rip and replace strategy is perhaps one reason why only 3% of companies researched by Innosight were embarking on significant strategic transformations 


-  DBSs culture change effort rested on the fundamental belief that its staff had the inherent capabilities to become innovators but lacked the tools and support to realize them 


- 11 ,  To see these lies for what they are and successfully transform their organizations ,  leaders first need to transform themselves 


-  More specifically ,  they have to find new ways to solve customer problems while at the same time scoping out new growth opportunities 


-  The challenge isnt just that these missions are in conflict and involve periods of chaos and uncertainty; it also is that they require fundamentally different mindsets and approaches 


-  Kegan terms this flexibility self-transforming ,  where leaders have the ability to step back from and reflect on the limits of our own ideology or personal authority; see that any one system or self-organization is in some way partial or incomplete; be friendlier toward contradiction and opposites; [and] seek to hold on to multiple systems rather than project all except one onto the other 


-  And leadership development  ( with rare exceptions )  hasnt caught up with this emerging need 


-  To transform themselves ,  leaders must focus more on mindsets ,  awareness ,  and inner capacities to combat basic biases that make it hard to make decisions in uncertainty and toggle between different frames 


-  But research increasingly suggests the best starting point is to embrace what broadly goes under the term mindfulness 


-  ,  To some ,  the word might sound squishy and New Agey ,  but meditation and related practices that use breathing to tune into thoughts and sensations have widely documented health benefits ,  such as boosting energy and lowering stress 


-  More critical ,  and for our purposes here ,  mindfulness boosts awareness ,  increasing  persons ability to step back ,  pause ,  and become aware of not just habitual thought patterns ,  but also emotional reactions 


-  As Potential Project managing director Rasmus Hougaard has noted ,  mindfulness is not about just doing more but also seeing more clearly what is the right thing to do and what is just  distraction 


-   mindful leader is better at toggling between different mindsets:  disciplined focus on transforming todays business and more entrepreneurial thinking to create tomorrows business 


-  Mindfulness is  powerful ,  scientifically validated tool for improving self-awareness ,  which is  critical and underappreciated tool for senior leaders confronting the challenges of disruptive change 


-  ,  Some leaders who have successfully managed transformative change have touted the value of mindfulness 


-  Aetnas Bertolini was an early advocate of advancing meditation programs at his company ,  and in 2014 ,  the company hired  chief mindfulness officer 


-  Bertolini credits mindfulness for easing chronic pain he suffered after  skiing accident and when recovering from  rare form of cancer 


-  He says it also improves his ability to process information and make sharp strategic decisions: With so many things going on ,  whether in  small or large organization ,  you can get frozen by attempting to process it all instead of being present ,  listening ,  and focusing on what really matters 


- 15 ,  Another example of the power of mindfulness comes from Pierre Wack ,  who advanced and popularized the idea of scenario planning while working at Royal Dutch Shell in the 1970s and 1980s 


-  Successful scenario planning ,  Wack noted ,  requires being in the right state of focus to put your finger unerringly on the key facts or insights that unlock or open understanding 


- 16 He noted that the value of scenario planning is not about developing specific plans that will actually be implemented or getting to the right scenario but about helping leadership understand that the future can be dramatically different from the present ,  while fostering  deeper understanding of the forces driving potential changes and uncertainties 


-  The approach ,  he said ,  gives managers something very precious: the ability to reperceive reality 


- 17 By sharpening his ability to toggle between present reality and future possibility ,  Wack and his team transformed scenario planning from  passive manipulation of data into an active tool to stretch thinking and advance discussions 


-  Single-shot leaders might have the personal ability to toggle between different mindsets ,  but they seem to struggle to codify core elements of their unique approach and institutionalize them 


-  Bridgewater gives employee feedback not just to boost short-term performance but to enhance long-term capacity 


-  It consciously helps its employees develop reflective muscles to understand defensive routines and blind spots and to improve their ability to acquire ,  process ,  and make sense of multiple forms of data 


-  This commitment to developing everyones sense-making capacity as  mission-critical component of long-term performance sets DDOs like Bridgewater apart 


-  SAP has trained more than 10 , 000 of its employees to use meditation to improve self-perception ,  regulate emotions ,  and increase resilience and empathy 


-  Participants report double-digit increases in their personal sense of meaning ,  their ability to focus ,  their level of mental clarity ,  and their creative abilities 


-  Participants answer diagnostic questions such as ,  Are you present in the moment ,  focused ,  and fully aware? and peer reviewers assess whether their self-image is keeping them from being the person they wish to be 


-  If you want to defeat the dilemma of disruption ,  you must start by defeating delusions about disruption
