-  international industrial competitiveness ,  driven by our continuing enormous balance of payments deficit ,  has tended to focus media and political attention during the 1980s on manufacturing 


-   torrent of books and articles has inundated business managers ,  offering guidance on how to improve manufacturing performance 


-  Terms like world class manufacturing and dynamic manufacturing sprinkle discussions in college classrooms ,  corporate boardrooms ,  and the halls of Congress 


-  The concept of manufacturing strategy ,  considered somewhat esoteric only  few years ago ,  gets increasing attention from both top managers and academics 


-  This less visible battlefield is that huge ,  ill-structured arena called the service sector ,  which employs 76 percent of our workforce and accounts for 68 percent of our real GNP 


-  It is also ,  unfortunately ,   sectorcomprising activities such as banking ,  engineering ,  transportation ,  communication ,  and myriad otherswhose trade surplus went negative for the first time in mid-1989 and is now barely in the black 


-  ,  We have no quarrel with the assertion that the United States needs  strong manufacturing base in order to maintain and improve its standard of living 


-  Just as our machine tool and semiconductor industries should have studied the successful attacks of foreign steel ,  auto ,  and consumer electronics producers on our domestic market-and prepared themselves for similar onslaughtsso should our service industries study and learn from our manufacturing sectors decline 


-  Those manufacturing firms that have remade themselves or sustained their leadership position have shared  common approach: they have focused attention on their most important markets and then mobilized their operations organization ,  through  well-planned strategy ,  to squarely meet those markets needs 


-  ,  In this article we will discuss how to make operations in service organizations more competitive 


-  Our key conclusions are that service firms ,  like manufacturing firms ,  can structure their operations according to  four-stage model of competitiveness and that they can apply the manufacturing strategy concepts of ocus and integration as they move from lower to higher stages 


-  ,  Service firm management ,  especially of operations ,  is best understood within the context of three key constructs 


-  ,  The strategic service vision is the logically organized plan for implementing new businesses and ideas 


-  It consists of four elements:  target market  ( Who is our intended customer? )  ,   service concept  ( What are the most important elements of our service from the customers perspective? )  ,   competitive strategy  ( How will we differentiate ourselves from our competitors? )  ,  and  service delivery system  ( How will we provide this differentiated service? )  


-  ,  The vision focuses on the customers perceived value of the service 


-  To remain competitive ,   service firm must consistently meet or exceed customers expectations of valuethe price they pay relative to the quality and convenience of the service they receive 


-  Amenities are add-ons that are not essential to the core service but that might sway  customers buying decision 


-  ,  An airlines core service ,  for example ,  is getting someone from one place to another 


-  As  general principle ,  the firm must provide basic competency in core and peripheral services to survive 


-  Put another way ,  the core and primary peripheral services define the lower limit of customer expectations about performance 


-  One sphere is the service encounter or cycle of encounters between the customer and the organization 


-  These involve such tasks as processing paperwork ,  cooking  restaurant meal ,  or taking baggage off of  plane 


-  These latter activities are analogous to the production processes in the factory working on things rather than people 


-  The existence of these two spheres of activity and ,  more important ,  the emphasis on the encounter as the core output function in most service organizations are what differentiate services from manufacturing 


-  The extent to which value is added in the front office rather than the back office often distinguishes one service business from another and determines structure and staffing of the operations organization itself 


-  ,  Regardless of  firms particular competitive strategy ,  senior management needs some framework for relating operations activities to the firms overall service performance 


-  The final and most compelling reason ,  in our opinion ,  is to provide  current perspective and future vision that can be communicated to the organizations members 


-  The questions where are we now? and where do we want to be? are more easily answered if they can be related to even  rough performance classification 


-  ,  The classification we propose for addressing these issues is the four-stage scheme depicted in Table  


-  Accompanying each stage are the management practices and attitudes that ,  based upon our experience ,  generally indicate how service firms at each stage deal with key operations issues 


-  ( An analogous framework ,  developed by Wheelwright and Hayes ,  is widely used to analyze the role of operations in strategy development for manufacturing firms 


-  )  ,  Before discussing the stages ,  we must consider two issues 


-  First ,  the stage attained by  firm at any given time is  composite 


-  Every service delivery system embodies  unique set of choices about such factors asservice quality ,  role of the back office ,  workforce policies ,  and the like 


-   company may fall at  different point along the continuum for each category or have some organizational units that are further or less advanced than others 


-  Thus  firm can achieve Stage  or possibly Stage  status ,  even if it is not outstanding on all dimensions ,  providing that it is clearly superior on the critical success factors for its industry 


-  An example here is UPS ,  whose mastery of its core service ,  through its technology and back office capabilities ,  enables it to go global and compete effectively on price 


-  Thus ,  in our view ,  it averages out to  Stage  company 


-  ,  Second ,  it is difficult ,  if not impossible ,  for  company to skip  stage in its quest for world class status 


-   company obviously must achieve journeyman performance levels before it achieves distinctive competence ,  and distinctive competence is  necessary foundation for becoming world class 


-  This does not mean that  company cant pass through  stage in  relatively short time ,  however 


-  Scandinavian Airlines Systems  ( SAS )  moved from Stage  to Stage  in about  year and  half After Suffering  huge operating loss in fiscal year 19791980 ,  its CEO ,  Jan Carlzon ,  instituted  program involving some 120 service improvements designed to help it become the airline of choice for its selected target market ,  the full-fare business passenger 


-  The improvements focused on achieving exceptional on-time performance and excellent service by all personnel 


-  By January 1982 ,  SAS had the best on-time record in Europe ,  and in August 1983 ,  Fortune named it the best airline for business travelers in the world 


-  ,  At the same time ,  companies can very easily slide back  stage 


-  This can come about gradually ,  typically from losing touch with the market ,  or overnight as the result of  widely publicized service failure 


-  An example of  gradual decline is that of Sears ,  whose complacency and bureaucratization have made them play catch-up in everything from pricing to customer service 


-  An example of an overnight downfall is the case of the Los Angeles Police Department ,  which was nationally recognized as  leader in policing practices prior to the Rodney King incident in the spring of 1991 


-  Even when  company has developed  clearly defined new service delivery system and debugged it on  pilot basis ,  getting it operational can involve months of retraining ,  extensive systems work ,  and so forth 


-  Woolworth takes  couple of years to test its new store concepts; Burger King runs extensive experiments in its R&D lab 


-  ,  Often ,  people assume that new technology will put them on the fast track through the four stages 


-  However ,  we know of no firms that have leapfrogged  stage solely by relying on  new technology 


-   new fleet of planes ,   new telecommunications system ,  or  new point-of-sale scanning system may be necessary for upstaging ,  but innovation cant do the job overnightor alone 


-  For example ,  while American Airlines and the American Automobile Association have achieved their dominant industry positions through aggressive use of information technologies ,  effective integration required major managerial and procedural refinements over the course of many years 


-  Fields Cookies computerized point-of-sale inventory tracking system worked because appropriate infrastructures were already in place 


-  ,  Service firms that fall into this category tend to consider their operations organizations necessary evils 


-  They often see operations mission as almost totally reactive: to deliver the service that some other person or group in the company has defined and to deliver it in the manner specified 


-  Thus management pays little attention to how other firms ,  whether direct competitors or not ,  design and manage similar service delivery systems 


-  The company makes little investment in specialized equipment ,  and it staffs operations with people who have marginal skillsand who are therefore willing to work for relatively low wages 


-  Constantly looking at the bottom line ,  management designs operations jobs that require little skill or creativity ,  and it provides almost no training 


-  Few people advance out of operations into another function or into general management ,  so operations tends to be regarded as  dead end 


-  Moreover ,  because operations employees acquire only limited skills in their jobs ,  they seldom can achieve major advancement by transferring to other companies 


-  Ironically ,  as in the case of the banking industry ,  efforts to cut labor costs frequently result in higher total costs because of the need to fix quality problems 


-  Therefore ,  after maintaining  sheltered existence for some time ,  Stage  firms often find themselves coming into direct competition with other companies that offer similar services in the approximate geographic area 


-  No longer can they simply ask operations to get the job done; they must seek feedback from their customers on the relative cost and perceived quality of their service ,  and ensure that they are not penalizing themselves unduly through idiosyncratic approaches ,  such as odd business hours or complicated credit procedures 


-  ,  Over time ,  such companies operations organizations tend to look more and more like those of their competitors 


-  They build similar facilities ,  use similar equipment and systems  ( often purchased from the same equipment or software suppliers )  ,  purchase materials or ancillary services from the same suppliers ,  adopt similar management practices ,  and routinely even hire workers and managers from competing firms 


-  Such people blend into their new environment almost immediately because it is so much like their previous one ,  and even use many of the same procedures 


-  Line managements role is to ensure that workers faithfully follow the procedures established by top management; improvisation is not encouraged 


-  ( Stage  companies ,  like Stage  companies ,  are not big on worker empowerment 


-  )  ,  In effect ,  companies that have adopted  Stage  approach have agreed not to compete against each other in terms of operations effectiveness; they all operate essentially the same way 


-  Penney and Montgomery Ward? )  Instead ,  they compete ,  often quite vigorously ,  along other dimensions: breadth of product line ,  advertising ,  and financial incentives 


-  Management still regards operations employees as specialists ,  and therefore they have limited upward mobility 


-  They do have more mobility between firms ,  however ,  and as  result begin to acquire an industry orientation 


-  In fact ,  their allegiance to their industry profession ,  often quite narrowly defined ,  usually surpasses their allegiance to the particular company they happen to work for at any given time 


-  ,  In summary ,  the challenge confronting Stage  firms is keeping pace with competitors that do just as good  job in the core service and that raise the ante by excelling on service quality or by providing peripheral services that have real value to the customer 


-  This problem faces upscale retail department stores such as Bullocks ,  Saks ,  and Robinsons ,  in the wake of Nordstroms legendary customer service 


-  An equally effective service system may take months or years to duplicate 


-  It is  fragile structure in which the competitive edge is often the invisible internal capabilities and organizational culture rather than the visible Steinway Grand on the mezzanine 


-  ,  In  Stage  firm ,  senior management has  clear vision of what creates value in the customers eyes ,  and it designs operations carefully to deliver that value 


-  The burden fell on virtually every part of the operations organization to convert this vision into reality ,  which it did with great success 


-  ,  The operations organization in  Stage  firm also reflects  coherent operations strategy ,  that is ,  making consistent choices for each element in Table  relative to price ,  quality ,  flexibility ,  and convenience objectives 


-  Relative to service quality ,  for example ,  operations is the typical advocate of  Total Quality Management philosophy ,  and it assumes the lead role in implementing service guarantees and service enhancing technologies ,  and fostering worker empowerment 


-  Federal Express is probably the classic example of  company that relies on its operations personnel to push ,  as well as execute ,  actions in these three areas 


-  First Interstate Bank of California ,  for example ,  spent three years shaping up its back office operations and its branch operations before it launched its five-point service guarantee 


-  It encourages all of its employees to learn multiple jobs in order to prepare themselves for advancement and to appreciate the problems and jobs of the other guy 


-  ,  The challenge for operations ,  and for the whole firm at this stage ,  is to assure that the operations strategy remains supportive of the rest of the company ,  particularly marketing 


-  At the same time ,  sales ,  marketing ,  and product development must be open to new service initiatives that operations personnel propose 


-  ,  The ultimate stage represents an apparently natural extension of Stage  ,  but  traditionally managed company will probably find this the hardest transition of all 


-  The company must develop the capabilities and credibility of its operations organization to the point where operations becomes proactive ,  forcing higher performance standards on the whole company ,  identifying new business opportunities ,  and helping redefine the firms competitive strategy 


-  Rather than simply investigating customer needs and attempting to fulfill them ,  Stage  companies  (  


-  The company bases its performance standards not on its own historical achievements ,  but on the performance achieved by its best competitors around the world ,  that is ,  it does competitive benchmarking 


-  It designs controls and rewards to motivate continuous improvements upon those standards ,  and it gives employees the tools and training to achieve them 


-  NYNEX ,  for example ,  offers its employees the Chairmans Award for World Class Service and provides extensive training in process management to help them attain it 


-  ,  The companys view of technology undergoes  similar transformation 


-  Rather than being simply  means for cutting costs and removing people ,  it becomes  potential means for developing competitive advantage ,  making it possible for the organization to do things its competitors cant do 


-  The company worries less about technological risk than about losing the first mover advantage 


-  For example ,  some leading firms have adopted an informate and automate strategy to let the customer know vital information and to facilitate the servers job 


-  Hertz has established business centers at some airports that are equipped with flight monitors providing the latest information on airline schedules and departure gates ,  and handouts that provide driving directions in five languages 


-  Faster service is facilitated by personnel using hand-held computers to print receipts in the parking lot so that customers dont have to go to the counter when returning cars 


-  ,  Workers in Stage  companies become company men and women in the best sense 


-  They are Marriott people ,  Southwest Airlines types ,  and Home Depot folks 


-  Their identity with the company they work for often matches or even exceeds that with their alma mater or hometown team 


-  Like production employees of world class manufacturers  ( the Millikens ,  Xeroxes ,  and Motorolas )  ,  operations employees of world class service firms ,  no matter what their job ,  know they are working someplace special and doing something valued by the company 


-  Indeed ,  just as the Honda janitor sweeping the floor is building cars ,  the Disney Maintenance Host sweeping the lot is helping the guests enjoy their day at the Park 


-  ,  Of course ,  managers of such companies also have tremendous pride in the organizations service and appreciate the centrality of operations in providing it 


-  Often such firms regard an outstanding service delivery system as so important that operations experience is considered essential to ones upward mobility 


-  In  similar vein ,  it is common for senior executives who run Stage  firms ,  in order to maintain their feel for operations as well as staying close to the customer ,  to spend time in the trenches 


-  ,  often took  turn at the registration desk ,  and the CEO of Columbus Riverside Methodist Hospital ,   leader in health care service quality ,  occasionally works as an orderly 


-  The president of Swissair has been seen dispensing boarding passes and has instructed all managers of the airline ,  regardless of function ,  to spend one day  month dealing directly with customers 


-  One challenge is sustaining superior performance at every point in its service delivery system and throughout its service network ,  as service firms often are judged more by the performance of their weakest links than by the things they do especially well 


-  To be world class ,  therefore ,  all organizational units must meet impeccable standards of service and productivity 


-  ,  The other major challenge ,  especially for multisite services ,  is managing the increasing complexity of personnel recruitment ,  training and motivation ,  technological innovation ,  and communication as the firm grows 


-  Operations ability to reproduce and manage its proven system in highly diverse cultural settings McDonalds in Moscowultimately determines the firms permanence ,  literally ,  as  world class competitor 


-  ,  The concept of manufacturing strategy has been around for over twenty years ,  but only in the last decade has it received serious consideration from academics and practitioners 


-  The strategy is based on the widely observed rule that general purpose systems ,  like general purpose tools ,  are seldom as effective as those that are designed and managed for  specific purpose 


- 10 Therefore ,   company must begin designing  manufacturing system with  careful ,  and broadly shared ,  assessment of how the firm will compete in  particular industryin what respects will its products and services be distinctive? Once the company establishes its competitive priorities ,  the paradigm provides an orderly approach for examining the organizations structure  ( facilities and equipment )  and infrastructure  ( policies and systems )  to determine if they are consistent with those priorities 


-  The term manufacturing strategy encompasses the whole process: setting competitive priorities ,  making structural and infrastructural decisions ,  and establishing  discipline  ( such as the notion of focused factories and plant charters )  for ensuring that the structure and infrastructure remain consistent with the priorities 


-  ,  We can easily adapt the same framework to service companies ,  although we must make  few modifications to accommodate the differences between services and manufactured products 


-  For our purposes ,  the key difference is that ,  for the service firm ,  the customer encounter with the system is the focal point of all operations activities 


-  ,  Assuming that the service company is  going concern and knows how it will compete in its industry ,  management may move around the wheel in Figure 1 baselining operations performance ,  setting priorities ,  focusing operations ,  achieving coherence ,  and incorporating learningwith each step linked to customer requirements 


-  ,   useful tool for this purpose is performance-importance mapping 


-  This involves gathering information ,  typically via customer surveys ,  on each aspect of service delivery and placing it on  grid  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  In this example ,  we have plotted factors of importance to bank customers 


-  The map shows that customers value short lines and think this banks lines are too long 


-  One could plot  similar grid showing on one axis selected competitors performance relative to the bank and ,  on the other ,  importance to customers 


-  When  company performs about the same as the rest of the industry on important elements ,  strategists call this qualifying to compete 


-  When it performs better than competitors on an unimportant element ,  we refer to it as an air ballessentially  waste of effort and resources 


-  ,  In manufacturing ,  focus calls for organizing factories according to the products specific processing requirements 


-  The essential issue is whether to design for high volume ,  standardized products using dedicated machines and specialized workers ,  or low volume ,  customized products using flexible equipment and broadly skilled workers 


-  Matching the right equipment to the product is critical for services as well 


-  Kentucky Fried Chicken got into trouble  few years ago by not recognizing this when it introduced spareribs 


-  The problem was that its technology and operating system were designed around frying and pressure cooking ,  not barbecuing 


-  The result: soggy ribs served by frustrated workers 


-  One problem is that customers dont like to be treated as high-volume products ,  even when the cost is low 


-  Another is that the typical direct service worker is often ill prepared in skills and policy knowledge to effectively customize  service 


-  ,  Service companies that lose focus ,  like their brethren in manufacturing ,  fail due to one or more of the following reasons: ,  By way of example ,  if an HMO chain seeks to improve the atmosphere of its waiting rooms ,  it can selectively change magazines ,  provide fresh coffee ,  or manage other forms of visible evidence of service quality 


-  It could administer customer surveys to ferret out the attitudinal effects of these seemingly minor modifications 


-  Some service firms are working along these lines ,  of course 


-  Banc One has  formalized process for providing the results of operations experiments to its member banks ,   practice that CEO John McCoy credits for rapid implementation of its operating improvements 


-  Likewise ,  Cal Fed Savings uses every other Monday conference calls among its regional managers to share sales and operating techniques that worked and didnt work 


-  The regional managers then share this information with their branch managers 


-  ,  Another approach is to use home office pilot plants to evaluate the layout and appearance of  field unit 


-  The Limited has full-size store interiors next to the presidents office in its hangar-like home office ,  enabling executives to tinker with the design until they get it right 


-  ,  Unlike manufacturing ,  which has often pushed operations to the background ,  the service sector challenges operations executives to use their inherently central position more effectively 


-  We believe these executives should take the lead in changing their areas relationship to customers ,  employees ,  and processes 


- 12 This ,  after all ,  seemed to work well for manufacturers because it kept outside influences ,  that is ,  customers ,  from disturbing the production process 


-  If  technician is assembling  widget ,  you dont want the customer asking him what hes doing 


- Or if  clerk is processing forms ,  talking to the customer on the phone takes her away from her job 


-  In retrospect ,  this closed system philosophy overlooked the fact that there are positive benefits to both the customer and the organization by having the customer closely linked to the server ,  even though the job is traditionally performed in the customers absence 


-  From an information exchange perspective ,  the greater the links between consumer and producer ,  the easier it is to understand and respond to the customers needs 


-  In manufacturing ,  the ability to link the producer with the consumer through direct computer linkups driving CAD/CAM systems has provided the technological wherewithal to go forward to the past to  craftsman-type organization 


-  That is ,  it has reintegrated design ,  production ,  and even sales into the manufacturing firms back officeits factory 


-  ,  That this open systems philosophy can be applied to services can be seen in the following practices: ,  Every service firm executive will aver that his or her organization is customer oriented and service driven 


-  However ,  if you scratch the surface of the organization ,  you will encounter an armadillo-like armor of procedures and rules that quickly indicates otherwise 


-  ,  To break out of the procedures trap ,  ask how you can make the encounter more user friendly; each rule you eliminate is value added from the customers perspective 


-  It is here ,  by the way ,  that systems and procedures groups should direct more of their attention ,  rather than to back office work simplification 


-  In fact ,  we would go even further and advocate  new positioncustomer task analystto look for ways to simplify the customers role in the service encounter 


-  Admittedly ,  many services find ways of easing the customers job ,  but rarely do they approach it with the same degree of analysis that they apply to their employees jobs 


-  Although both have made extensive use of information technologyCAD/CAM and materials management in manufacturing and database management and transaction processing in servicesboth are still wrestling with the age old problem of getting departments to work together 


-  The common contemporary solution is to cast each operating unit as  service supplier to the next downstream operation unit ,  that is ,  establishing an internal supplier-customer relationship 


-  For many firms ,  however ,  this approach is only marginally successful ,  for the simple reason that many important supplier duties are not explicitly measured ,  monitored ,  and most of all ,  rewarded in performance reviews 


-  Lets face it ,  no matter how company oriented the manager ,  helping the other guy will always be  secondary priority ,  unless it is an important and rewarded priority on the management by objectives sheet 


-  We are not advocating that the downstream customer philosophy be dropped 


-  What we do advocate is that internal supplier service duties and actions be clearly acknowledged in the organizations performance measurement and reward system 


-  ,   companys stage of operations effectiveness reflects directly on its vulnerability to competition 


-   Stage  company ,  for example ,  will generally operate successfully as long as it remains protected by location or personal relationships ,  or if all its competitors are also in Stage  


-  Corner groceries ,  dry cleaners ,  and hamburger joints are examples 


-  Such companies become vulnerable ,  however ,  as soon as their niche is invaded by  company that is more representative of the industry as  whole and has elevated its operating capabilities to Stage  status 


-  But if one or more of their competitors elevates its operations capabilities to Stage  ,  and can thereby offer superior cost ,  quality ,  flexibility-responsiveness ,  or convenience ,  they find themselves in trouble 


-   bank ,  for example ,  that was able to offer one-stop banking services profitably under regulation may find itself unable to compete against other banks or financial service firms that focus on providing superior service of  more restricted product line 


-  So it is that the only competitor that  Stage  company has to fear is  world class Stage  companyone that has developed its capabilities and honed its operations to the point that it can compete anywhere in the world 


-  Once it has attained Stage  ,   company can successfully enter  number of national markets ,  and it often does so with surprising speed and effectiveness 


-  ,  The danger for  Stage  company is that ,  despite its evident success and the lack of visible challengers ,  one or more Stage  companies may be gestating out of sight in some foreign environment 


-  Clearly ,  the time to prepare ones operations strategy for the eventual battle is now ,  while those emerging world class service organizations ,  be they foreign or domestic ,  are still preparing themselves for the attack
