- WHAT MAKES an organization effective? For  long time we thought we had the answer 


-  ,  Then along came the so-called contingency theorists ,  who argued that it all depends 


-  ,  While  agree that being effective depends on doing the right thing as well as doing things right ,  as Peter Drucker put it years ago ,   believe we have to probe more deeply to find out what really makes an organization effective 


-  We need to understand what gets it to  viable strategy in the first place ,  what makes it excellent once its there ,  and how some organizations are able to sustain viability and excellence in the face of change 


-  ,  Some years ago  thought  had another answer 


-   argued that effective organizations got it all together 


-  In  sense ,  these organizations played jigsaw puzzle ,  fitting all the pieces of their operations into one neat image 


-  But some rather effective organizations do not ,  and even those that do sometimes confound things 


-  How does that big blue machine come up with critical adaptations when it has to ,  and why does 3M have those tight financial controls? Thus  have begun to consider another view of organizational effectiveness ,  in which organizations do not slot themselves into established images so much as build their own unique solutions to problems 


-  Do your own thing is its motto ,  LEGO its metaphor 


-  Taking these forces as fundamental and their interplay as key to understanding what goes on in organizations ,   shall argue first that when one force dominates an organization ,  it is drawn toward  coherent ,  established form ,  described as configuration 


-  This may seem complicated ,  but bear with me; reading about it here will prove  lot easier than managing it in practice 


-  It may even help! ,  Charles Darwin once wrote about lumpers as opposed to splitterssynthesizers who think in broad categories and prefer to slot things into well-established pigeonholes ,  as opposed to analyzers who tend to split things up finely3 In  way ,  of course ,  we are all lumpers: we all like neat envelopes into which we can put our confusing experiences 


-  Imagine biology without some system of species to consider living things 


-   believe that configuration occurs when any one of these forces dominates an organization ,  driving it to  corresponding form 


-  ,  Do these forms really exist in practice? In one sense ,  they do not 


-  On the other hand ,  we cant carry reality around in our heads; we think in terms of simplifications ,  called theories or models ,  of which these forms are examples 


-  We must ,  therefore ,  turn to  second question: whether the forms are useful 


-  And again  shall answer ,  yes and no 


-  With configuration ,  an organization achieves  sense of order ,  of integration 


-  ,  Outsiders also appreciate configuration; it helps them to understand an organization 


-  We walk into  McDonalds and know immediately what drives it ,  likewise  3M 


-  No configuration is perfect the professional one ,  for example ,  tends to belittle its clients ,  while the machine one often alienates its workersbut there is something to be said for consistency 


-  Better to have the definition and discipline of configuration than to dissipate ones energies trying to be all things to all people 


-  ,  Moreover ,  much of what we know about organizations in practice applies to specific configurations 


-  But only so long as everything holds still 


-  For example ,  the quest for efficiency in  machine organization can almost totally suppress the capacity for innovation ,  while in an adhocracy the need for some modicum of efficiency often gets suppressed 


-  Unfortunately ,  while lead may block X-rays ,  there is no known medium to shield the effects of  dominant culture 


-  ( The controller drops by ,  just to have  look: What ,  no shoes? Cant they be creative dressed properly? )  Of course ,  the opposite case is also well known 


-  Until things go out of control 


-  Thus ,  when the need arises for change ,  the dominating force may act to hold the organization in place 


-  For example ,   machine organization in need of  new strategy may find neither the direction of an entrepreneurial leader nor the innovation of intrapreneurial subordinates 


-  Very roughly ,   believe these five organizational neuroses correspond to what tends to happen to each of the five forms 


-  Those who have worked in universities and hospitals understand the collective paranoid tendencies of professionals ,  especially when free of the constraining forces of administration and innovation 


-   need not dwell on the depressive effects of obsession with the bottom line in the diversified organization; the impact on morale and innovation are now widely appreciated 


-  One requires divergent thinking ,  the other convergent 


-  But how does the effective organization deal with this contradiction? ,  Configuration is  good thing when you can have it 


-  ,  How common are combinations as compared with configurations? To some extent the answer lies in the eyes of the beholder: what looks like  relatively pure form to one person  (  lumper )  may look like  combination of forces to another  (  splitter )  


-  Still ,  it is interesting to consider how organizations appear to intelligent observers 


-  For several years now ,  we have sent McGill MBA students out to study organizations in the Montreal area ,  having first exposed them to ,  among other things ,   book of mine on the five forms of structure 


-  At year end ,   have circulated  questionnaire asking them to categorize the organization as one of the forms ,   combination of two or more ,  or neither 


-  The next CEO ,  John Sculley ,  apparently felt the need to temper that innovation; he paid more attention to efficiency in production and distribution 


-  When  presented this framework at an executive program  couple of years ago ,  an employee of Apple Canada saw other things going on in his operation: he added an entrepreneurial form in sales due to  dynamic leader ,  professional forms in marketing and training to reflect the skills there ,  and another adhocracy form in  new venture unit 


-  ,  Then there is the question of how the different forces interact with each other 


-  And some organizations are lucky enough to buffer the effects of the different forces; in newspapers ,  the more professional editorial function simply hands over its camera-ready copy to the machinelike plant for production ,  and there is little need for interaction 


-  Richard Cyert and James March wrote some years ago about the sequential attention to goals in organizations ,  where conflicting needs are attended to each in their own turn 


-  In fact ,  Fellini made  film with exactly this theme 


-  Only then are they prepared to cooperate with their leader ,  because only then do they realize he is necessary to perform effectively 


-  But one need not turn to allegories to find examples of cleavage 


-  It occurs in most combinationsfor example ,  in the classic battles between the R&D people ,  who promote new product innovation ,  and the production people ,  who want to stabilize manufacturing for operating efficiency 


-  The question thus becomes again: how does the effective organization deal with the contradiction? ,  So far our discussion has suggested that an organization finds its place in the pentagon and then stays there ,  more or less 


-  But ,  in fact ,  few organizations get the chance to spend their entire lives in one place: their needs change ,  and they must undergo conversion from one configuration or combination to another 


-  It may work well for the young organization ,  but with aging and growth the need for direction may be displaced by the need for efficiency 


-  In fact ,   have placed the forces and forms on the pentagon to reflect the most common of these ,  with the simple ,  earlier stages near the top and the more complex ones lower down 


-  Once again ,  then ,  the question arises: how does the effective organization deal with the contradiction? ,  The question of how to manage contradiction has concluded each section of this article 


-   believe the answer lies in the two forces in the middle of the pentagon 


-  Indeed ,   believe that these two forces themselves represent  contradiction that must be managed if an organization is not to run out of control 


-  ,   have placed these two forces in the middle of the pentagon for  particular reason 


-  While it is true that each can dominate an organization ,  and so draw it toward  distinct form  ( referred to earlier as ideological and political )  ,   believe that these forces more commonly act differently from the other five 


-   shall argue that both can promote change and also prevent it ,  and that either way the organization is sometimes rendered more effective ,  sometimes less 


-  They commit themselves personally to the organization and identify with its needs 


-  ( Of course ,  when ideology is strong ,  there are no comparable organizations! )   good example of this is Hewlett-Packards next bench syndrome: the product designer receives his or her stimulus for innovation ,  not from the aggregations of marketing research reports ,  but from the needs of  particular colleague at the next bench 


-  Ideology above all draws people to work together to take the organization where all of them believe it must go 


-  In this sense ,  ideology should be thought of as the spirit of an organization ,  the life force that infuses the skeleton of its formal structure 


-  Bureaucratic machines are not supposed to be snappy ,  but ideology changes the nature of their quest for efficiency 


-  This ,  of course ,  is the central message of the Peters and Waterman book ,  In Search of Excellence: effectiveness is achieved ,  not by opportunism ,  not even by clever strategic positioning ,  but by  management that knows exactly what it must do  ( sticks to its knitting )  and then does it with the fervor of religious missionaries  ( hands on ,  value driven 


-  The different forces no longer need conflict in quite the same way 


-  Likewise ,  if 3M and Hewlett-Packard really do conform largely to the adhocracy model ,  why do they have such tight control systems?  suspect we have the answer here 


-  People develop  grudging respect for one another: when it matters ,  they cooperate for the common good 


-  But we know this place could never function without him 


-  Likewise in the great symphony orchestra ,  the musicians respect their conductor ,  without whom they know they could never produce beautiful music 


-  ,  Such organizations can more easily reconcile opposing forces because what matters to their people is the organization itself ,  not any of its particular parts 


-  If you believe in IBM more than marketing finesse or technical virtuosity per se ,  then when things really matter you will suspend your departmental rivalries to enable IBM to adapt 


- 11 How ,  then ,  has Toyota been able to produce such high-quality automobiles at such reasonable cost? Why didnt Toyota get stuck in the middle? ,   believe that Porters admonition stems from the view ,  prevalent in  


-  assembly lines have long had good reason to consider themselves mere cogs in their bureaucratic machines 


-  Each had  job to do and was not to think about anything elseincluding quality and innovation 


-  But at Toyota ,  one has the impression that each individual is made to feel like an embodiment of the entire systemthat no matter what job one does ,  it helps to make Toyota great 


-  Thus the only thing that gets stuck in the middle at Toyota is the conventional management thinking of the West! ,  So far  have discussed the reconciliation of contradictions between different people and units 


-  ,  Overall ,  then ,  ideology sounds like  wonderful thing 


-  For one thing ,  ideologies are difficult to build ,  especially in established organizations ,  and difficult to sustain once built 


-  For another thing ,  established ideologies can sometimes get in the way of organizational effectiveness 


-  As Karl Weick has argued ,  A corporation doesnt have  culture 


- 12 The fact is that there are no five easy steps to  better culture 


-  ,   argued above that ideology promotes change by allowing an organization to reconcile contradictory forces 


-  Now  should like to argue exactly the opposite case 


-  Receiving the word enables people to ask every question but one: the word itself must never be questioned 


-  ,   can explain this by introducing two views of strategy ,  one as position ,  the other as perspective 


-  Some argue yes ,  of course ,  because it brought the firm into the breakfast market 


-  Their disagreement concerns not the change at McDonalds so much as their implicit definition of strategy 


-  Ideology becomes  force for the status quo; indeed ,  because those who perceive the need for change are forced to challenge it ,  the ideology begins to breed politics! ,  To understand this negative effect of ideology ,  take another look at Figure  


-  We have no need for the extreme example of  Jonestown to appreciate this negative consequence of ideology 


-  We all know organizations with strong cultures that ,  like that proverbial bird ,  flew in ever-diminishing circles until they disappeared up their own rear ends 


-  People pull apart for their own needs 


-  Indeed ,  both problems were characterized as intrinsically conflictive in the first place; the presence of politics for other reasons simply enhances them 


-  Nothing remains at the coreno central direction ,  no integrating ideology ,  and ,  therefore ,  no directed effort at efficiency or proficiency or innovation 


-  ,  Thus ,   believe that only through achieving some kind of balance of these two catalytic forces can an organization maintain its effectiveness 


-  That balance need not ,  however ,  be steady state 


-  ,  What is it ,  then ,  that makes an organization effective? Of course ,  were the answer easyand easily appliedall organizations would be equally effective 


-  Clearly ,  to be effective means to do the right thing and to do it rightto be both Porterian and Peterian 


-  But  have argued that there is more to organizational effectiveness than this ,  that the answer must also lie in managing the consistency of form as well as the contradiction of forces 


-  Organizations need focus ,  but they also need balance 


-  Getting everything together into  known form ,  if it all fits ,  more or less ,  is not  bad way to organize 


-  And whichever it is ,  watch out for the occasional need for conversion ,  during which you must also be careful of cleavage 


-  No matter what ,  you will still have to manage contradiction 


-  Encourage healthy competition ,  occasionally even outright politics ,  to ensure needed adaptation 


-  Playing jigsaw puzzle and LEGO with the same pieces is no easy matter
