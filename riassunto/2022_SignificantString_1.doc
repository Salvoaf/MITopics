- Few habits are harder to break than the way we do things around here 


-  Relationships can complicate matters further 


-  Rather than calculating an average score  say ,     on  given value ,  leaders need to know where the pockets of 3s and 5s  ( and even the clusters of 1s and 2s )  are 


-  And they need to see who is interacting with whom within and between those pockets and clusters if they want to persuade people to embrace new cultural priorities 


-  ,  Combining survey data with network analysis is  useful way to gain that insight 


-  It shows ,  for example ,  where people are separated by silos in  network ,  who is isolated on the periphery ,  which individuals are opinion leaders ,  and which ones are uniquely situated to connect people and integrate different values 


-  By analyzing whats worked for them ,  we have identified five ways to drive culture change through informal networks 


-  Leaders often think about the culture of their piece of the organization and take action at that level  the CEO for the whole organization ,  senior executives for their specific units ,  and so on 


-  The most-selected priority was drive strong growth in existing brands ,  but agreement was far from uniform 


-  Rather than simply mobilize around this as  unifying priority  (  typical action after  standard culture survey )  ,  leaders turned to network data to better understand how peoples informal connections shaped their beliefs 


-  Seeing others enthusiasm often helped the outliers reconsider their own beliefs and become more productive partners ,  and it sometimes also helped brand enthusiasts better see their own blind spots 


-  Despite their high ROI ,  many of these projects were routinely denied funding ,  but it wasnt until she saw the results of the network and cultural analysis that she realized she was being blocked by an outlier:  well-connected senior manager in the divisions finance group who had negatively influenced the funding decisions made by several of his subordinates 


-  ,  After giving the problem some thought ,  the product manager invited the finance manager to an annual competition the company hosted ,  where consumers brought creative dishes that used the companys product in innovative new ways 


-  Before ,  he had considered the product to be stale ,  but the product managers unthreatening approach gave him space to adjust his beliefs 


-  ,  The second opportunity for culture change focused on disagreements among subnetworks ,  which leaders sought to reframe as expressions of different underlying aspirations ,  without passing any judgment on what was right or wrong 


-  The network data helped leaders identify the best-connected people in each subnetwork ,  with the goal of bringing them together to generate ideas that would diffuse well to others 


-  ,  Some subnetworks were encouraged to push even harder in the direction in which they were already leaning 


-  They were tasked with using their skills in product development ,  consumer research ,  and materials science to pursue bold ideas that were not tied to existing products 


-  As  result ,  they often invest considerable effort in crafting powerful statements on important new values or behavioral expectations ,  and they then either communicate them directly to employees or cascade them down the leadership hierarchy 


-  ,  Many leaders cascade messages through offsite meetings that bring managers together to clarify values or priorities 


-  Progressive companies might also include employees whose opinions seem respected by peers 


-  Unfortunately ,  while these additions may create  sense of being inclusive ,  our research has shown that by guessing who is important ,  companies typically miss at least half of their true cultural influencers 


-  Most employees learn about culture from informal conversations that signal which colleagues they should take seriously ,  what to care about ,  and how we do things around here 


-  And network influencers shape those conversations considerably 


-  In one organization we studied    , 100-person division at  well-known manufacturer  the top 50 informal influencers had ties with 60% of the employees ,  whereas the top 50 senior leaders had ties with only 31% 


-  They were selected not only because they were well regarded by many in their home function but also because they had ties to influencers in other functions 


-  Leaders brought the influencers and customers together in  design thinking program 


-  Instead of pointing fingers at one another to deflect blame as usual ,  team members found themselves drawn into understanding the customers underlying needs 


-  They engaged in What if? thinking and quickly came to envision new offerings the bank could explore 


-  The ideas were important ,  of course ,  but the real win from these workshops was the way they helped people understand the value that colleagues in other functions brought to the process 


-  ,  Once the employees minds were opened ,  the workshop leader asked them the question that he had been holding back: How should the banks culture change to support this kind of customer-focused innovation? Having spent all day working with people from other functions ,  attendees saw how they were stronger together 


-  Although the verbiage differed ,  many of the responses gathered from the various workshops pointed to the same desired values: respect for others positions ,  joint accountability for competitive success ,  and joint ownership of the customer experience 


-  The change-initiative leader reflected ,  We have tried design thinking efforts around customer needs before ,  but things always fizzled out 


-  Finding the influencers and bringing them together was the thing that made this such  success 


-  Small ,  hidden disagreements throughout an organization have  way of slowly and quietly killing change initiatives  the proverbial death by  thousand cuts 


-  As  result ,  nothing changed 


-  ,   new CEO brought  renewed emphasis on culture ,  but this time with the goal of making dissent and disagreement more constructive 


-   combination of network and cultural data uncovered two kinds of problems:  (  )  toxic misalignments ,  where cultural influencers with very different values interacted in negative and dysfunctional ways ,  and  (  )  unresolved standoffs ,  where cultural influencers had positive connections with one another but disagreed about fundamental cultural values 


-  ,  One of the toxic misalignments involved strong disagreement about monetizing user data; some influencers felt that selling customer data to third parties was inappropriate ,  while others supported doing it on the basis that it simply helped third parties market more efficiently 


-  Their conflict spilled over into meetings and other interactions that had nothing to do with data monetization ,  undermining progress on  range of fronts 


-  In an ideal world ,  what accomplishment regarding customer data can you imagine that you would be most proud of? She asked people to write down their answers 


-  After some discussion ,  they began to explore ways to generate more benefits for customers through data sharing and how that could be accomplished while respecting their privacy 


-  Now that they had agreed on the overarching value of respect for customers ,  their tension was productive 


-  Network analytics can be used to identify where the influencers are on each side of  disagreement; they are always distributed throughout the network and never in  single role ,  function ,  or geography 


-  ,  Unresolved standoffs ,  in contrast ,  involve influencers who have no reason to mistrust each other but whose disagreement about  cultural value harms their productivity 


-  Heres an example that we found in the same technology company ,  after  restructuring brought three disparate functions  organizational development ,  process improvement ,  and software development  into the same unit 


-  Despite good intentions and shared objectives ,  six months later ,  the new unit had made little progress on joint projects 


-  ,  The fundamental problem was  three-way disagreement about the most important priority to guide their joint efforts 


-  Should it be people ,  processes ,  or technologies? Unable to make headway ,  the functional groups went off on their own ,  devised and promoted their own approaches ,  and threw partial solutions over the transom at each other 


-  The people in these groups liked each other personally but couldnt understand why the others didnt see things the same way 


-  Because the leader had picked influencers to attend ,  the new shared values and priorities that emerged made their way back to the larger population and catalyzed  cultural shift to  more collaborative unit 


-  ,  Traditional approaches to cultural change often assume that the process is rational: Leaders identify new values and educate employees about them ,  using anecdotes ,  examples ,  and compelling logic ,  in hopes of persuading them to commit to new ways of working 


-  ,  In particular ,  people who prompt positive emotions in their colleagues excel at getting others to adopt desired cultural values 


-  With that knowledge ,  the company started training first-level supervisors to become more skilled as energizers 


-  ,  In contrast ,  people who evoke negative emotions ,  such as fear or resentment ,  are very good at propagating unwanted cultural norms or stifling the spread of desired values 


-  Leaders in one business unit of  large technology company gathered network data about the people with whom respondents were reluctant to share early-stage ideas or differing points of view 


-  Without identifying these individuals by name ,  we shared the results with the organizations leaders and subject matter experts more broadly 


-  Through  series of discussions ,   common set of ideas emerged around how work was assigned ,  how input was sought ,  how advice was framed ,  and how disagreements were handled 


-  Leaders established new practices to encourage more accountable behavior on everyones part  for instance ,  curbing the spread of rumors and gossip 


-  Leaders may see slow or uneven adoption as new cultural ideas failure to spread ,  when in fact it may be  function of how tacit or complex the values are 


-  And while networks play an important role in speed of adoption ,  faster isnt always better 


-  Facing tough competition for top talent ,  senior leaders realized that their traditional assumptions about employee productivity and career advancement were alienating the very people they had just fought to hire 


-  Many supervisors and midlevel managers hadnt fully grasped the deeper cultural shift involved and thus treated the supporting behaviors in ways that undermined their intent 


-  For instance ,  email on weekends was prohibited ,  but many managers just set their emails on  time delay ,  resulting in an onslaught of new demands first thing every Monday morning 


-  The analysis revealed that some of the more nuanced behaviors  including applying highly discerning judgment to every idea and taking risks that were big but worthwhile  took longer than others to learn 


-  ( The network analysis identified connections that would legitimize the presence of  junior employee in  meeting of senior leaders and provide assurance of that persons trustworthiness and discretion 


-  )  These experiences accelerated adoption of the desired behaviors through experiences that employees normally would not have had access to for years ,  perhaps even decades 


-  These employees imitated what they thought was being modeled but missed the mark because they didnt fully understand the underlying cultural values 


-  One such value embraced intensive testing of new ideas for weakness through fierce and informed debate 


-  Unfortunately ,  these newcomers got the impression that the culture was antagonistic toward innovative ideas ,  and they simply attacked anything they thought strayed too far from the companys existing strategy 


-  For instance: Dont argue with data unless you have better data ,  and dont object to  claim unless you can explain how your insights provide  different perspective 


-  ,   surprising side effect of this mentoring was improved retention for newcomers 


-  Previously ,  those who had picked fights without understanding the cultural rules had also left the organization quickly 


-  But now that they understood the need to hold back at first ,  they were able to build more productive network ties with others early in their tenures 


-  ,  Combining network analysis with assessments of organizational culture provides leaders with  rich understanding of how new values take root 


-  It gives them  more local view of culture  one where desired behaviors are communicated ,  modeled ,  observed ,  and adopted on the ground ,  not broadcast from on high 


-  And that perspective allows leaders to drive change in more targeted ways 


-  They learn how new ideas and beliefs spread ,  who the real influencers are in their organization ,  and how long the process can take  which makes it easier to propagate new values where they are needed and produce enduring outcomes
