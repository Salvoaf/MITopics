-  General Manager Lou Colatriano grinned with tired satisfaction and headed home for his first break in forty-four hours 


-  ,  Every manufacturing company in the United States would like to be able to make that statement 


-  In fact ,  so does any factory ,  as innovation is generally associated with research laboratories and development organizations 


-  But as speed to market becomes an increasingly important criterion of competitive success ,  we need to rethink our concept of what  factory is 


-  factories were passive service organizations to the rest of the company ,  churning out products designed without benefit of manufacturing input and burying product and process defects under mountains of inventory 


-  ,   learning laboratory is an organization dedicated to knowledge creation ,  collection ,  and control 


-  Contribution to knowledge is  key criterion for all activities ,  albeit not the only one 


-  In  learning laboratory ,  tremendous amounts of knowledge and skill are embedded in physical equipment and processes and embodied in people 


-  More important ,  however ,  are the nontechnical aspects ,  the managerial practices and underlying values that constantly renew and support the knowledge bases 


-  ,  In this article  put Chaparral Steel under the microscope as an example of  highly successful learning laboratory; its leadership has put tremendous effort into creating  consistent learning system 


-  As my references suggest ,  scholars studying best practices among Japanese manufacturers have made strikingly parallel observations ,  and Chaparrals policies are consistent with prescriptions by organizational learning theorists 


-  His confidence derives from the fact that the learning laboratory cannot be constructed piecemeal 


-  By then ,  Chaparral managers trust they will have moved on to the next innovation 


-  ,   learning laboratory does not occur spontaneously but is designed ,  created ,  and maintained through constant managerial attention to communicating the underlying values ,  checking the management systems smallest details for consistency ,  and adapting any inharmonious elements 


-  They will have to acknowledge the practical utility and bottom-line impact of corporate values 


-  Everyone in the firm must appreciate the self-reinforcing nature of knowledge-creating activities 


-  Only by comprehending the whole system can one understand why ,  when  fragment of the learning laboratory is pulled out to be examined  (  particular project ,   specific learning activity )  ,  it comes out vinelike ,  trailing roots back to deeply held values and widely observed management practices 


-  ,  Learning requires creation and control of both external and internal knowledge for both current and future operations 


-  Therefore ,  four distinguishing activities are critical to  learning laboratory:  (  )  problem solving  ( in current operations )   (  )  internal knowledge integration  ( across functions and projects )   (  )  innovation and experimentation  ( to build for the future )  and  (  )  integration of external information flows  ( see Figure  )  


-  Each activity is the operational expression of an underlying value and is strongly supported by  compatible managerial system of procedures and incentives 


-  Thus each activity ,  value ,  and managerial system functions as an internally consistent subsystem 


-  Although  will describe each subsystem separately ,  the four are mutually aligned and interrelated; that is ,  values and managerial systems underlying one subsystem also support the other three 


-  ,  Before exploring these subsystems ,  however ,  we need  brief explanation of Chaparrals near net-shape project ,  an innovative foray directly into the traditional territory of Big Steel that illustrates the companys knowledge creation and control subsystems 


-  ,  One way to push equipment performance and ensure learning is to set goals for each project considerably beyond current production capabilities 


-  Reaching this cost objective  ( half of Big Steels )  required drastically reducing the energy costs  ( roughly 25 percent of total )  of rolling the steel into the required end shape 


-  The steel-making molds and processes developed for the near net-shape project therefore embody knowledge beyond anything available on the market and ,  in fact ,  beyond anything the leading vendors of steel-making molds thought possible 


-  Reaching this cost objective  ( half of Big Steels )  required drastically reducing the energy costs  ( roughly 25 percent of total )  of rolling the steel into the required end shape deceptively simple in appearance 


-  However ,  the mold is patented ,  which suggests that the combined expertise of Chaparral designers and Italian and German mold fabricators endowed it with cutting-edge knowledge 


-  It is difficult to imagine how Chaparral could have succeeded in this knowledge-intensive project had the company not been run as  learning laboratory 


-  ,  Some of the activities ,  values ,  and managerial practices described below characterize any high-quality organization 


-  Since they operate as  system ,  we have to look at the whole operation to understand why emulating just some parts may never produce true learning laboratories 


-  ,  The first critical learning subsystem is the triad of  (  )  the independent problem solving required for continuous improvement of current processes ,  (  )  egalitarianism as an underlying value ,  and  (  )  shared rewards as the reinforcing incentives system  ( see Figure  )  


-  Empowered individuals ,  who command respect in the organization and who feel ownership in the system ,  have the self-confidence ,  freedom ,  and motivation to continuously solve problems 


-  ,  Learning starts with empowered individuals who can identify and solve problems independently because they have  clear sense of operating objectives 


-  Unless the vision can be directly translated into operational principles ,  that is ,  into guidelines for running the factory lines ,  it may have little effect on actual shop-floor behavior 


-  He considers it obvious that improvement is always  part of his job: Were still learning ,  but we will get it 


-  If it works ,  it is the de facto standard 


-  ,  The downside to this intrapreneurial attitude is that although managers set the goals ,  no one has the authority to tell another employee how to accomplish  task 


-  They are not called upon enough ,  in their opinions 


-  However ,  the benefits from general ownership of all problems are that it is not possible to pass the buck and no one expects  steady-state manufacturing process ever 


-  Outward symbols of values are important because they convey meaningful messages to all employees 


-  Forward on down exactly what is on your mind 


-  There is no problem in expressing your opinion here 


-  Repeated requests to interview  particularly knowledgeable project manager are politely rebuffed with  shrug and an explanation from  vice president: Sorry ,  he just doesnt want to 


-  Chaparral managers believe that  supervisor should be  leader ,  trained to make good decisions  including hiring and firing 


-  For instance ,  in contrast to many factories ,  operators are not assigned to shifts according to seniority 


-  Everyone rotates into night shift ,   practice that fosters knowledge accumulation twenty-four hours  day and guards against  possible disproportionate accumulation of skills and knowledge in the most favored hours 


-  What keeps the workforce from burning out? One factor is the incentive systems that have evolved 


-  We think janitors and secretaries are important in our success ,  too ,  and they should share in the rewards ,  observes Forward 


-  ,  The second subsystem revolves around knowledge accrual  ( see Figure  )  


-  In the learning laboratory ,  knowledge is highly and visibly valued 


-  Management invests in educating the whole person ,  not just the technical side ,  and knowledge flows freely across boundaries 


-  The principle is this: every day ,  in every project ,  add to the knowledge resources 


-  ,  In  learning laboratory ,  one would expect to see visible embodiment of knowledge creation and control in highly innovative physical systems 


-  Chaparral boasts of such cutting-edge equipment as an automobile shredder that they believe is the fastest and most efficient in the world ,   horizontal  ( instead of vertical )  caster ,  and some of the most advanced digital furnace controls anywhere 


-  Because of the constant push to improve production ,  Chaparral managers have to design what they need ,  rather than purchase the best available equipment off-the-shelf Why design in-house? To keep the knowledge here ,   mill manager explains 


-  Rolling mill equipment that its vendor believed was limited to eight-inch slabs is turning out fourteen-inch ,  and the vendor has tried to buy back the redesign 


-  ,  The physical processes following the molding step are also knowledge intensive 


-  The hot link meant less subsequent rolling than usual and hence less working of the steel to obtain the desired crystalline structure 


-  Chaparral processes seem clear outgrowths of skill ,  yet how does such expertise and knowledge accumulate? ,  Just as continuous processing has great advantages for manufacturing over most batch processing ,  so the unimpeded flow of information aids learning more than fragmented ,  batch-processed information 


-  In contrast ,  Chaparral management emphasizes homogenizing the level of knowledge throughout; few pockets of information are isolated by position ,  function ,  or working shift 


-  An individual garnering knowledge on  trip ,  at  conference ,  or from an experiment can readily transmit it ,  as all employees are located in the same place and know each other 


-  The company was also designed to facilitate knowledge flows by encouraging as many accidental meetings as possible 


-  This is  do-it-yourself company with no acknowledged staff positions and only  few positions that seem stafflike ,  such as personnel 


-  In fact ,  everyone has line responsibilities ,  most of them tied directly to steel production ,  and decision making is pushed down to the lowest possible supervisory level ,  where the knowledge is 


-  Lead operators are selected for their knowledge-transmitting as well as knowledge-creating skills ,  because much knowledge flows horizontally among peers 


-  Work is structured with the objective of disseminating knowledge 


-  After the initial eight weeks of this grueling schedule ,  these operators will be dispersed among the rest of the crews to diffuse the knowledge they have created and assimilated about the new processs idiosyncrasies 


-  ,  Chaparral has also proven that traditional horizontal boundaries can be redrawn and expectations altered 


-  ,  Although the company has  marketing department ,  everyone is considered  salesperson 


-  Every employee from CEO to receptionist has  business card to use with customers 


-  Such multifunctional experience is encouraged not only to make the organization more flexible but because management believes it discourages territorial possessiveness over information 


-  However ,  interfacing with the possessors of the latest scientific knowledge is not restricted to an elite group of specialists 


-  When the worlds leading supplier was constructing the patented mold for the near net-shape project ,  the three-person team that shuttled back and forth to the site in Germany ,  learning about the fabrication process and serving as  source of information about the intended production process ,  included an operator 


-  As described later in Subsystem Four ,  Chaparral employees at all levels are constantly tapping into the latest ,  most current knowledge banks around the world 


-  ,  Since performance drives everything in this company ,  and individual incentives are tied to performance ,  employees seem engaged in  marathon relay race ,  where winning as  company team takes precedence over individual ownership of ideas ,  and knowledge is liberally shared 


-  There are acknowledged experts ,  such as the director of operations who is an equipment whiz ,  and the mold expert who was largely responsible for the near-net shape design ,  and the organization does not lack for large egos 


-  However ,  Vice President of Operations Dave Fournie says that you dont have to have credit for particular ideas to be thought good at your job 


-  They go through  gestation period ,  and lots of people figure out how to make sense of it 


-  ,  An organization that values knowledge must provide mechanisms for continuous learning 


-  ,  The roughly three-and-a-half-year program allows apprentices to progress to the level of senior operator/ craftsman by successfully completing  , 280 hours of on-the-job training and designated formal schooling 


-  The foremen of individual crews schedule the on-the-job training and evaluate the candidates systematic progression through various tasks in the factory 


-  In addition ,  all apprentices complete study programs in safety ,  operating processes across the entire company ,  mathematics as related to operations ,  metallurgy ,  and basic mechanical maintenance in an effort to give all operators  solid basic understanding of the equipment used and the operating processes 


-  ( Operators may also get credit for prior experience by proving knowledge on the job 


-  )  Courses include basic engineering knowledge such as conduction in liquids and gases ,  as well as very specific skills such as ladder logic programming for understanding programmable controllers and lubricant storage and handling 


-  ,  The most unusual aspect is the instructors 


-  Selected foremen rotate in from the factory floor to teach 


-  It creates  lot of credibility for the education program on the factory floor ,  explains one instructor 


-  ,  Chaparral also invests in outside courses of all types ,  tending to train its own people rather than hiring those with  particular skill 


-  In few factories would  furnace controls operator attend  Dale Carnegie-type course to help him enhance the interpersonal skills critical to smooth teamwork 


-  Line managers are expected to be technical experts ,  constantly up-to-date with cutting-edge technology  whether that be some aspect of metallurgy or human resources 


-  The manager of the scrap shredding operations ,  for instance ,  has just attended  conference on recycling  in the future ,  Chaparrals expertise in recycling may be an important corporate capability 


- 15 ,  The third subsystem in  learning laboratory involves constantly pushing knowledge frontiers  ( see Figure  )  


-  The company must select employees for their desire to challenge their own and others thinking 


-  The company must select suppliers for their superior capabilities  and for their willingness to be pushed beyond the bounds of their current knowledge 


-  This extremely technical presentation was to help directors understand the methodical knowledge-creation process ,  enable them to identify critical decision points ,  and thereby better equip them to evaluate the risk 


-  Another example of knowledge-creating experimentation more often found in research laboratories than factories is the one-sixth scale model of the near net-shape caster ,  which uses water to approximate the flow of steel 


-  The disadvantage is the obvious potential to disrupt production  which is why most factories prefer to isolate experimentation 


-  We were the local hardware stores favorite plywood customers for  while ,  one employee recalled 


-  We dont know the factorys limits 


-  What surprised partners was that Chaparral did not appear to begrudge the wasted $40 , 000 per mold ,  since the knowledge engendered by each prototype enabled the next step in innovation 


-  ,  In  research laboratory ,  risk is accepted as the norm ,  since the cutting edge is always fraught with uncertainty 


-  Managers of  learning factory must tolerate ,  even welcome ,   certain amount of risk as  concomitant of knowledge acquisition 


-  If everyone experiments ,  learns ,  and innovates ,  then neither success nor failure can be heavily personalized 


-  In 1986 ,  when Fournie was medium section mill superintendent ,  he championed the installation of  $1 


-  Since promoted to vice president of operations ,  Fournie is somewhat amused to find that visitors cant believe you can make  mistake like that and not get crucified 


-  You give them bigger and bigger chunks and evaluate 


-  The company therefore hired  ( and continues to hire )  from the immediate geographic area ,  seeking ranchers and farmers with mechanical ability but no steel experience 


-  Highly selective hiring procedures continue to reflect concern that new employees fit into the Chaparral culture ,  that at least one supervisor be personally committed to their training and progress ,  and that the team have  stake in their success 


-  These very cautious ,  resource-intensive selection practices may account in part for the extremely dedicated workforce ,  which boasts an absentee rate about one-fourth that represented by the National Association of Manufacturers 


-  ,  Since people are the key resource in  knowledge-intensive organization ,  keeping them is critical 


- 17 Beach explains: From the very beginning ,  we designed this organization with Maslows hierarchy of needs in mind [i 


-   know its not stylish ,  but we really believe in that hierarchy ,  so we constantly look at what will help people become self-actualized ,  at their ego needs 


-  Chaparral managers believe that skilled ,  innovative people will leave an organization if they see no possibility for personal growth 


-  Management regards this change as an organizational experiment that may provide  model for other parts of the company 


-  Management has learned the necessity of training in advance of the need because of problems experienced early in the companys history ,  when operators who were automatically moved up into lead and then supervisory positions as vacancies opened proved underprepared 


-  This crosstraining is intended to prepare them for general management of an entire operation ,  when Chaparral starts up another site 


- 19 ,   learning laboratory obviously needs access to the latest knowledge ,  embodied in the best minds and best equipment available 


-  Therefore the principle behind the fourth and final subsystem is this: create  virtual research organization through extensive networking and alliances  for learning and for economic reasons  ( see Figure  )  


-  Information obtained externally is rapidly incorporated through development projects ,  flowing through the created network almost as readily as it does inside the walls of the learning laboratory ,  because in both cases people working directly in production transmit the knowledge 


-  Yet it was inflexible ,  would cost more than the entire company ,  and was more labor intensive than desired 


-  Chaparral therefore enlisted the help of German and Italian suppliers 


-  At first extremely skeptical of this small company from the middle of Texas and hence unwilling to try to make the radical mold design ,  the German supplier began to believe that seemingly impossible goals could be achieved only when it saw how far Chaparral had progressed with the help of the Italians 


-  Chaparral employees visited the German vendor every few weeks ,  and ultimately Chaparrals expertise combined with the Germans cutting-edge knowledge to produce  patented mold that neither company could have made alone 


-  Chaparrals superintendent of steel-melt technology went to Mexico to direct the simulation of the future mill design ,  using Mexican equipment and workers 


-  However ,  knowing such sources of expertise exist would be useless if the factory were not able to tap them ,  to jointly create more knowledge ,  and then to absorb that knowledge into the production system 


-  ,  Chaparrals collegial knowledge network seems more characteristic of  research laboratory than of  factory 


-  Possibly because of Forwards early career as  research metallurgist ,  the company aggressively pursues the latest knowledge 


-  Chaparral sought the coveted Japanese certification for steel ,  not because managers thought they would ever sell much steel in Japan ,  but because they believed the Japanese would go through the companys process carefully  and Chaparral would learn much from the exercise 


-  Forward takes  distinctly nontraditional view of environmental scanning for  factory: By the time you hear about  technology in  paper at  conference ,  it is too late 


-  This philosophy explains why Chaparral invests in unorthodox knowledge-gathering mechanisms ,  for instance ,  by cosponsoring  research conference with the Colorado School of Mining about  new alloy under investigation 


-  Managers at Chaparral believe that through their virtual R&D organization ,  they can actually tap  larger variety of knowledge bases than they would be able to support internally ,  given their size 


-  Still ,  they will have to continue investing in internal expertise in order to integrate the externally obtained knowledge 


-  There is no value in recreating something  only in building on the best existing knowledge 


-  People in  learning laboratory value the capability to absorb and use knowledge as much as to create it 


-  They understand that all invention is  process of synthesis 


-  As its practices suggest ,   key Chaparral value is global outreach  openness to innovation ,  whatever its origin 


-  Knowledge is valued not so much for the pedigree of its source but for its usefulness 


-  ,  To support information gathering and reinforce global outreach ,  the company invests heavily in employee travel  ( and regards the expenses as just that  investments )  ,  often sending  team ,  including foremen and technical staff as well as vice presidents and operators ,  to investigate  new technology or to benchmark against competitors 


-  Newly acquired knowledge need not filter down through the ranks ,  because the people who absorbed it are the ones who will apply it 


-  In 1990 ,  seventy-eight people from production ,  several of them operators ,  visited  customer site at least once 


-  As  general manager explains ,  although it was clear that initially the supplier would learn more than we from the alliance ,  Chaparral spent the money to send employees over to hand hold so as to develop  capability that would be useful in the future 


-  ,  This constant dispersal of mixed employee teams to customers ,  competitors ,  and suppliers throughout the world serves  dual purpose 


-  The visits are regarded as learning sabbaticals that keep life exciting for employees 


-  We want them to  come back with new ideas about how to make improvements or new ways to understand the problem 


- 21 ,  The factory in fact any backroom operation ,  is not usually regarded as an arena for experimentation and learning 


-  Moreover ,  the whole organization is designed around the creation and control of knowledge 


-  Continuous education depends upon the careful selection of willing learners 


-  The organization is unlikely to be open to outside knowledge if it does not place  strong value on sharing knowledge or does not give rewards for bettering the whole companys performance 


-  Thus continuous learning depends upon the sense of ownership derived from the incentive systems ,  upon the pride of accomplishment derived from special educational systems ,  upon values embedded in policies and managerial practices ,  as well as upon specific technical skills 


-  The line operator appears to take the same perspective on the conduct of daily activities as the CEO 


- 22  learning laboratory may have trouble recreating itself Any organization is likely to be somewhat limited by its congenital knowledge and by the stamp placed upon it by its founders 


-  Forward has noted that to stand still is to fall behind ,  and the companys credo to provide growth for its skilled people requires some forward momentum 


-  How will it transplant the deep worker knowledge ,  the motivation ,  the commitment ,  and the informal systems of knowledge sharing? ,  For other companies interested in creating factories as learning laboratories ,  the questions are: Can it be done in  plant within  large corporation ,  where many of the managerial systems have already been set corporatewide and therefore are not at the plant managers discretion? Can an existing plant be transformed when plant managers may not have the luxury of selecting people as freely as Chaparral did? Can  company less geographically isolated hope to reap returns on investing in its employees intellectual advancement ,  or will they be lured away by other companies? ,  Similar questions were raised  decade ago when  


-  manufacturers first began to understand how Japanese companies were competing on the basis of quality 


-  Initially overwhelmed by the difference in activities ,  values ,  and managerial systems implied by the total quality approach ,  many  


-  managers were pessimistic about their ability to change their operations to the extent needed and reluctant to invest in employee education 


- -based factories achieve quality levels never even aspired to in 1980 


- 26 As the references at the end of this article suggest ,  many of Chaparrals managerial practices and values also characterize best practices in Japan ,  such as investing extensively in formal and informal education; searching worldwide for the best technology and methods and absorbing that knowledge into home operations; and valuing employee empowerment ,  problem solving ,  and risk taking 


-  factories can start up from scratch ,  creating  learning laboratory implies big changes 


-  ,  Experts on change management suggest that three critical elements are required for altering current practices:  (  )  dissatisfaction with the status quo;  (  )   clear model of what the changed organization will look like; and  (  )   process for reaching that model ,  that vision of the future 


-  One way of stimulating dissatisfaction with current practices and hence motivation to change is to observe other companies where an alternative management style appears to be yielding superior results 


-  By benchmarking against such companies ,  managers can derive principles to incorporate into their own particular visions 


-  Chaparral offers  model of  factory as  learning laboratory ,  and if the specifics are not transferable ,  the principles underlying the Chaparral vision are 


-  It is possible to interrupt  factorys current systems by introducing new equipment ,  new learning skills and activities ,  new knowledge-creating management systems ,  or new values 


-  As the Chaparral example demonstrates ,  learning skills ,  management procedures ,  and values are interrelated 


-  Values unsupported by management systems are vapid; management systems that run counter to values are likely to be sabotaged; learning activities unsupported by values and management practices will be short-lived 


-  If  learning capability is to be developed ,  the whole system must eventually be addressed
