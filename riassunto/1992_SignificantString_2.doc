-  ,  Yet in the mid-1970s ,  the production-line approach to service was the darling child of service gurus 


-  We do not intend to debunk empowerment ,  rather we hope to clarify why to empower  ( there are costs ,  as well as benefits )  ,  how to empower  ( there are alternatives )  ,  and when to empower  ( it really does depend on the situation )  


-  ,  In two classic articles ,  the Production-Line Approach to Service and the Industrialization of Service ,  Theodore Levitt described how service operations can be made more efficient by applying manufacturing logic and tactics 


-  ,  McDonalds is  good example 


-  They learn  set procedure for assembling the order  ( for example ,  cold drinks first ,  then hot ones )  ,  placing items on the tray ,  and placing the tray where customers need not reach for it 


-  This production-line approach makes customer-service interactions uniform and gives the organization control over them 


-  ,  What are the gains from  production-line approach? Efficient ,  low-cost ,  high-volume service operations ,  with satisfied customers 


-  ,  Ron Zemke and Dick Schaaf ,  in The Service Edge: 101 Companies That Profit from Customer Care ,  note that empowerment is  common theme running through many ,  even most ,  of their excellent service businesses ,  such as American Airlines ,  Marriott ,  American Express ,  and Federal Express 


-  ,  The humanistic flavor of empowerment pervades the words of advocates such as Tom Peters: ,  And from Jan Carlzon ,  CEO of Scandinavian Airlines Systems  ( SAS )  ,  In contrast to the industrialization of service ,  empowerment very much looks to the performer of the tasks for solutions to service problems 


-  Workers are asked to suggest new services and products and to solve problems creatively and effectively 


-  ,  What ,  then ,  does it really mean  beyond the catchy slogans  to empower employees? We define empowerment as sharing with frontline employees four organizational ingredients:  (  )  information about the organizations performance ,  (  )  rewards based on the organizations performance ,  (  )  knowledge that enables employees to understand and contribute to organizational performance ,  and  (  )  power to make decisions that influence organizational direction and performance 


-  For now ,  we can say that with  production-line approach ,  these features tend to be concentrated in the hands of senior management; with an empowerment approach ,  they tend to be moved downward to frontline employees 


-  The companys motto is people ,  service ,  and profits 


-  Behind its blue ,  white ,  and red planes and uniforms are self-managing work teams ,  gainsharing plans ,  and empowered employees seemingly consumed with providing flexible and creative service to customers with varying needs 


-  Here ,  too ,  we find turned-on people and profits 


-  In fact ,  rigid operational guidelines help guarantee the customer reliable ,  low-cost service 


-  UPS is  top-down ,  traditionally controlled organization ,  in which employees are directed by policies and procedures based on industrial engineering studies of how all service delivery aspects should be carried out and how long they should take 


-  Although they represented diverse services  banking ,  travel ,  utilities ,  airlines ,  and shipping  and they disagreed on most points ,  they all agreed that empowerment is key to customer satisfaction 


-  But is it? ,  What gains are possible from empowering service employees? ,  Check-in time at the hotel begins at   


-  The waitress is taking an order in  modestly priced family restaurant; the menu says no substitutions ,  but the customer requests one anyway 


-  ,  The customer wants  quick response 


-  This is particularly valuable when there is little time to refer to  higher authority ,  as when the plane is leaving in fifteen minutes 


-  Even before greeting customers ,  empowered employees are confident that they have all the necessary resources at their command to provide customers with what they need 


-  Figure  depicts the relationships among service delivery ,  recovery ,  and customer satisfaction 


-  ,  Fixing something after doing it wrong the first time can turn  dissatisfied customer into  satisfied ,  even loyal ,  customer 


-  These employees lack the power and knowledge to recover ,  and customers remain dissatisfied 


-  Have you ever washed  rental car? Decades of job design research show that when employees have  sense of control and of doing meaningful work they are more satisfied 


-  ,  Research now supports our long-standing intuition that customers perceptions of service quality are shaped by the courtesy; empathy; and responsiveness of service employees 


-  Customers want employees to appear concerned about their needs 


-  Can empowerment help create this? One of us has done customer service research in branch banks that showed that when the tellers reported feeling good about how they were supervised ,  trained ,  and rewarded ,  customers thought more highly of the service they received 


-  In short ,  when employees felt that management was looking after their needs ,  they took better care of the customer 


-  In banking ,  where the customer receives no tangible benefits in the exchange other than  savings deposit slip ,   sour teller can really blemish  customers feelings about the encounter 


-  The bank study showed that the tellers could accurately report how customers viewed overall service quality and how they saw the branches service climate  (  


-  When it comes to market research ,  imagine the difference in response rates from surveying your employees and surveying your customers 


-  Why? Their satisfied-no-matter-what customers spread the word about their service and become repeat customers 


-  For example ,  Federal Express selects customer agents and couriers on the basis of well-researched profiles of successful performers in those jobs 


-  The production-line approach trains workers easily and puts them right to work 


-  In contrast ,  new hires at SAS are formally assigned  mentor to help them learn the ropes; Nordstrom department managers take responsibility for orienting and training new members of the sales team; customer service representatives at Lands End and  


-  They receive far more information and knowledge about their company and its products than is the norm 


-  Retail banking ,  department stores ,  and convenience stores are labor intensive ,  and their training and selection costs can run high 


-  ,  Many consumer service organizations ,  such as department stores ,  convenience stores ,  restaurants ,  and banks ,  rely on large numbers of part-time and seasonal workers to meet their highly variable staffing needs 


-  These employees typically work for short periods of time at low wages 


-  To empower these workers ,   company would have to invest heavily in training to try to quickly inculcate the organizations culture and values 


-  This training would probably be unsuccessful ,  and the employees wouldnt be around long enough to provide  return on the investment 


-  Alternatively ,  the organization could pay higher wages to full-time ,  permanent employees ,  but they would be idle when business was slow 


-  ,  Remember the hotel guest wanting to check in early and the airline passenger requesting special treatment at the gate? True ,  there is  benefit to empowering the employee to bend the rules ,  but only for the person at the front of the line! Customers at the back of the line are grumbling and checking their watches 


-  They may have the satisfaction of knowing that they too may receive creative problem solving when and if they reach the counter ,  but it is small consolation if the plane has already left 


-  ,  Based on our experiences as both researchers and customers ,  we believe that customers will increasingly value speed in service delivery 


-  We also believe that many customers value no surprises in service delivery: They like to know what to expect when they revisit  service business or patronize different outlets of  franchise 


-  ,  The research data show that customers perceive reliability  doing it right the first time  as the most important dimension of service quality 


-  It matters more than employees responsiveness ,  courtesy ,  or competency; or the attractiveness of the service setting 


-  Much of the touted appeal of the production-line approach was that procedurally and technocratically driven operations could deliver service more reliably and consistently than service operations heavily dependent upon the skills and attitudes of employees 


-  The production-line approach was intended to routinize service so that customers would receive the best outcome possible from their service encounters  service delivery with no glitches in the first place 


-  ,  We feel that service managers need to guard against being seduced into too great  focus on recovery ,  at the expense of service delivery reliability 


-  Recovery has more sex appeal than the nitty-gritty detail of building quality into every seemingly mundane aspect of the service delivery system ,  but an organization that relies on recovery may end up losing out to firms that do it right the first time 


-  ,  Sometimes creative rule breaking can cause  major problem for an organization 


-  ,  These are some of the costs and benefits of empowerment 


-  We hope this discussion will help service businesses use empowerment knowledgeably ,  not just because it is  fad 


-  We have used anecdotal evidence ,  related research  (  


-  More systematic research must assess whether this array of costs and benefits fully captures the whys  ( and why nots )  empowerment 


-  This is largely because the production-line approach is an example of the well-developed control model of organization design and management ,  whereas empowerment is part of the still evolving commitment or involvement model 


-  ,  profit sharing and stock ownership )   (  )  knowledge that enables employees to understand and contribute to organizational performance  (  


-  ,  through quality circles and self-managing teams )  


- 13 They represent increasing degrees of empowerment as additional knowledge ,  information ,  power ,  and rewards are pushed down to the front line 


-  Employees are encouraged to contribute ideas through formal suggestion programs or quality circles ,  but their day-to-day work activities do not really change 


-  ,  Suggestion involvement can produce some empowerment without altering the basic production-line approach 


-  McDonalds ,  for example ,  listens closely to the front line 


-  As another example ,  Florida Power and Light ,  which won the Deming quality award ,  defines empowerment in suggestion involvement terms 


-  Employees believe their tasks are significant ,  they have considerable freedom in deciding how to do the work ,  they get more feedback ,  and they handle  whole ,  identifiable piece of work 


-  Research shows that many employees find enriched work more motivating and satisfying ,  and they do higher-quality work 


-  Teams are often appropriate in complex service organizations such as hospitals and airlines because individuals cannot offer  whole service or handle  customer from beginning to end of service delivery 


-  ,  Employees in this environment require training to deal with the added complexity 


-  Supervisors ,  who now have fewer shots to call ,  need to be reoriented toward supporting the front line ,  rather than directing it 


-  Virtually every aspect of the organization is different from that of  control-oriented organization 


-  Employees are extensively cross-trained to work where they are needed 


-  Only time will tell if America West can make high-involvement work as it struggles with its financial crisis stemming from high fuel costs and rapid growth 


-  It organized its  , 000 clerical workers in Memphis into superteams of five to ten people and gave them the authority and training to manage themselves 


-  For example ,  early job enrichment efforts in the 1960s assumed that all employees would prefer more challenging work and more autonomy 


-  By the 1970s it was clear that only those employees who felt the need to grow at work responded positively to job enrichment 


- 15 As the research on it is still thin ,  it is at least possible that empowerment is  universal truth ,  but historical evidence weighs against its being the best way to manage in all situations 


-  ,  We believe that both the empowerment and production-line approaches have their advantages ,  and that each fits certain situations 


-  The key is to choose the management approach that best meets the needs of both employees and customers 


-  Each contingency can be rated on  scale of  to  to diagnose the quality of fit between the overall situation and the alternative approaches 


-  ,  Proposition 1: The higher the rating of each contingency  (  being the highest )  ,  the better the fit with an empowerment approach; the lower the rating  (  being the lowest )  ,  the better the fit with  production-line approach 


-  ,  Proposition 2: The higher the total score from all five contingencies ,  the better the fit with an empowerment approach; the lower the total score ,  the better the fit with  production-line approach 


-   production-line approach is  good fit with situations that score in the range of  to 10 


-  ,  Proposition 3: The higher the total score ,  the more the benefits of increasing empowerment will outweigh the costs 


-  ,  In what follows ,  we describe each contingencys implications for  production-line or empowerment approach 


-  ,   production-line approach makes the most sense if your core mission is to offer high-volume service at the lowest cost 


-  The question is: what is the value-added from spending the additional dollars on employee selection ,  training ,  and retention necessary for empowerment? This question is especially compelling in labor-intensive services  (  


-  ,  fast food ,  grocery stores ,  and convenience stores )  and those that require part-time or temporary employees 


-  Certain customer segments are just looking for cheap ,  quick ,  reliable service 


-  They do want quality   warm hamburger rather than  cold one 


-  ,  These customers prefer  production-line approach 


-  Taco Bell wants to serve customers who want low-cost ,  good quality ,  fast food 


-  Interestingly; the company believes that as more chains move to customized ,  service-oriented operations ,  it has more opportunities in the fast ,  low-price market niche 


-  ,  The production-line approach does not rule out suggestion involvement 


-  ,  An empowerment approach works best with  market segment that wants the tender loving care dimension more than speed and cost 


-  For example ,  SAS targets frequent business travellers  ( who do not pay their own way )  


-  Consequently ,  the company looked at every ingredient of its service package to see if it fit this segments definition of service quality ,  and ,  if so ,  whether or not customers would pay for it 


-  ,  The relationship itself can be the principle valued commodity that is delivered in many services 


-  When no tangibles are delivered ,  as in estate planning or management consulting ,  the service provider often is the service to the customer ,  and empowerment allows the employee to customize the service to fit the customers needs 


-  The valuable service they sell is time 


-  ,  It is very difficult to build challenge ,  feedback ,  and autonomy into  telephone operators job ,  given the way the delivery technology has been designed 


-  In these situations ,  the technology limits empowerment to only suggestion involvement and ultimately may almost completely remove individuals from the service delivery process ,  as has happened with ATMs 


-  ,  When technology constrains empowerment ,  service managers can still support frontline employees in ways that enhance their satisfaction and the service quality they provide 


-  For example ,  managers can show employees how much their jobs matter to the organizations success and express more appreciation for the work they do 


-  In other words ,  managers can do  better job of making the old management model work! ,  Routine work can be engaging if employees are convinced that it matters 


-  Volunteers will spend hours licking envelopes in  fundraising campaign for their favorite charity 


-  Disney theme park employees do an admirable job of performing repetitive work ,  partly because they believe in the values ,  mission ,  and show business magic of Disney 


-  ,  Businesses that operate in unpredictable environments benefit from empowerment 


-  In this environment ,  the service business can use  production-line approach 


-  The stability allows ,  even encourages ,  management with policies and procedures ,  because managers can predict most events and identify the best responses 


-  ,  Empowerment and production-line approaches demand different types of managers and employees 


-  For empowerment to work ,  particularly in the high-involvement form ,  the company needs to have Theory  managers who believe that their employees can act independently to benefit both the organization and its customers 


-  If the management ranks are filled with Theory  types who believe that employees only do their best work when closely supervised ,  then the production-line approach may be the only feasible option unless the organization changes its managers 


-  For example ,  most industry observers would agree that Delta and American Airlines are managed with  control orientation rather than  strong empowerment approach 


-  ,  Employees will respond positively to empowerment only if they have strong needs to grow and to deepen and test their abilities  at work 


-  Again ,   checkered history of job enrichment efforts has taught us not to assume that everyone wants more autonomy ,  challenge ,  and responsibility at work 


-  Some employees simply prefer  production-line approach 


-  ,  Lastly ,  empowerment that involves teamwork requires employees who are interested in meeting their social and affiliative needs at work 


-  It also requires that employees have good interpersonal and group process skills 


-  ,  How likely is it that more and more service businesses will choose to face the customer with empowered employees? We would guess that far more service organizations operate at the production-line end of our continuum than their business situations call for 


- 17 This survey revealed that manufacturing firms tend to use significantly more employee-involvement practices than do service firms 


-  Manufacturing firms use quality circles ,  participation groups ,  and self-managing work teams far more than service firms 


-  ,  Why is this so? We think that the intense pressure on the manufacturing sector from global competition has created more dissatisfaction with the old control-oriented way of doing things 


-  Also ,  it can be easier to see the payoffs from different management practices in manufacturing than in service 


-  Objective measures of productivity can more clearly show profitability than can measures of customer perceptions of service quality 


-  However ,  these differences are now blurring as service competition increases and service companies become more sophisticated in tracking the benefits of customer service quality: ,  As service businesses consider empowerment ,  they can look at high-involvement manufacturing organizations as labs in which the various empowerment approaches have been tested and developed 


-  Many lessons have been learned in manufacturing about how to best use quality circles ,  enriched jobs ,  and so on 


-  And the added good news is that many service businesses are ideally suited to applying and refining these lessons 


-  ,  In summary ,  the newest approaches to managing the production line can serve as role models for many service businesses ,  but perhaps not all 


-  Before service organizations rush into empowerment programs ,  they need to determine whether and how empowerment fits their situation
