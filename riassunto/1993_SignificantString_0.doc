- Traditionally ,  leadership has been described as the ability of  superior to influence the behavior of subordinates and persuade them to willingly follow  desired course of action 


-  ,  But why are salespeople different from other employees? And what is this unique form of leadership? These questions are the focus of this article 


-  Moreover ,  prospective and current customers are not reluctant to report  salespersons improper conduct ,  questionable ethics ,  or inadequate services 


-  If the group fails to reach this expected level of productivity ,  the sales manager alone has to explain the failure 


-  Moreover ,  the manager must continuously perform as  leader as he or she trains subordinates in the field ,  conducts sales meetings ,  analyzes the reasons for lost sales ,  and hassles with leaders for sales support and resources 


-  These traits are classified into three categories:  (  )  conceptual and technical skills and knowledge ,  (  )  human relations attributes ,  and  (  )  motivation 


-  ,  Another approach has been to compare leadership styles based on questions like these: ,  Clearly ,  Leniger and Pacetta can be compared in terms of both of these approaches 


-  ,  Burns and Bass introduced  broader paradigm of leadership that transcends but implicitly incorporates trait and behavioral style considerations in describing alternative methods of leadership 


-  ,  Goals for salespeople often include sales volume in dollars or units ,  new account acquisition ,  customer retention rate ,  percent of quota ,  willingness to assist new sales recruits ,  and so on 


-  Subordinate sales managers may be evaluated by such criteria as group sales increases ,  controllable profits ,  balancing of sales volume across multiple product lines ,  salesforce turnover rates ,  share of market or sales penetration rates in the assigned territory ,  and company image relative to competitors 


-  ,  The leader can reward successful performance with increased commissions ,  bonuses ,  salary increases ,  promotions to higher-level positions ,  recognition in company house organs ,  trophies ,  transfers to larger territories ,  praise ,  and other responses to followers short-term wants or needs 


-  When confronted by  salesman who was producing poor results and who complained because he was being monitored more closely than one of the top producers ,  an industrial sales manager replied: When youre doing okay ,  youll hardly know Im around 


-  Transactional leaders such as Rick Horn of Stahl Company  ( manufacturers of truck bodies )  use the laissez-faire approach 


-  He feels that anything else gets in the way of their selling: I dont feel like  have to ever tell my salespeople what to do 


-  All  want to know is where they are in case  have to reach them 


-  ,  Frank Pacetta also believes in the rewards for results approach ,  but ,  unlike Leniger ,  he offers  good deal of warmth and positive reinforcement to his inexperienced salesforce for  job well done 


-  ,  How experienced must people be in order to respond to transactional leadership? We conclude that inexperienced ,  less confident ,  but hungry ,  subordinate salespeople and sales managers want transactional leaders to set objectives for them and provide instructions about how to achieve them 


-  Successful ,  independent self-starters may think that  leaders external efforts are only part of the influence process ,  because self-leadership makes  strong contribution toward motivating them to success 


-  Many sales leaders think that if  three-year-old on  playground swing can master the art of self-management ,  sales followers can do the same regardless of their level of experience 


-  The capable transformational sales leader has the power to convert the subordinates latent desires into current needs 


-  He or she broadens the scope and magnifies the strength of subordinates wants ,  desires ,  and needs 


-  The result is  transfer of energies and an attendant motivational climate that encourages sales personnel to surpass their own expectations and personal objectives for the good of the sales district and company 


-  Transformational leadership is the process of shaping the salespeople or subordinate managers ,  molding them into what the leader wishes them to be 


-  Through her understanding of how saleswomen are inspired by dreams or visions of achieving goals ,  she remains convinced that saleswomen will work for recognition when they wont work for money 


-  Transformational sales leaders extend the boundaries of transactional leadership by exhibiting three recognizable characteristics:  (  )  charisma ,  (  )  intellectual stimulation ,  and  (  )  individualized consideration 


-  ,  Sales managers who have charisma create feelings in sales subordinates that exceed ordinary esteem ,  affection ,  admiration ,  respect ,  and trust 


-  ,  Jensen set his own selling example that emerged from his favorite saying: ,  Charismatic leaders are mood creators who encourage continuing positive reinforcement; they communicate what they want mirrored or imitated 


-  When empowered ,  many salesforce members develop strong feelings of self-confidence ,  thus triggering very powerful dynamic inner drives 


-  )  Positive self-talk  ( Im sure our sales district can reach our quota )  leads to the followers positive self-esteem ,  which ,  in turn ,  leads to positive performance and then to even more positive self-talk  ( There is no doubt we will exceed any quota assigned to us )  


-  When you give your spouse an energetic hug ,  youll get one back 


-  Yet he may be stubbornly insensitive to followers desires for warmth ,  attention ,  and support 


-   transformational sales leader stimulates subordinates by creating  readiness for changes in thinking and by encouraging subordinates to use new approaches for solving old and continuing problems and to apply past examples to emerging problems 


-  ,   leader can stimulate followers awareness of enduring and emerging problems that tend to create barriers between an instilled strategic vision and desired marketplace results 


-  Achieving such an objective may require  lengthy agenda that begins with  rejection of conformity   change in thinking about the recruitment and selection processes 


-  ,  Yet Watson was one of the most intellectually stimulating sales leaders of the twentieth century because of his ability to transform subordinates into constructive thinkers 


-  He was convinced that the ability to think is  rare quality and that success is the inevitable result of the thinking process 


-  His genius for adapting allowed him to remove an idea from its original setting ,  think about it ,  modify it to meet an intended application ,  and implement it 


-  ,  Although leaders in almost all functional areas must live through difficult times ,  few situations are as unpleasant as the voluntary turnover of  valued sales manager ,  the usurpation of  key account ,  serious loss of market share in  territory ,  or unethical behavior by trusted sales personnel 


-  The possible stimulants are rethinking ,  reorienting ,  discussing ways to avoid crises ,  proactively planning in anticipation of  crisis ,  reactively planning after  crisis ,  maintaining ongoing responsibilities while confronting disruptive events ,  having  strong sense of humor ,  and preparing to cope with the next crisis 


-  ,  Individualized attention requires that the leader show concern for each salesperson or submanager rather than for tasks ,  policies ,  administrative matters ,  or decision making 


-  Individualized consideration is workable at all levels of the sales management hierarchy 


-  However ,  it is useful to explain its value at lower levels ,  such as the relationship between the first-line field sales manager and each assigned sales-force member 


-  ,  As shown in Table  ,  the ideal field sales manager will possess conceptual and technical skills and knowledge ,  demonstrate considerable capability in the human relations area ,  and will be highly motivated 


-  However ,  it may be even more difficult to convince salespeople to transcend their own self-interests for the benefit of the organization without the leaders knowledge of ,  sensitivity to ,  and response to each assignees unique needs for growth and development 


-  Those they perceive as competent and skillful ,  trustworthy ,  and highly motivated become the in-group that receives more latitude and support and are called cadres 


-  ,  Under Tom Watson ,  no one could think of being  boss 


-  In this sense ,  individualized consideration takes the form of supervision that occurs in the field ,  face to face with  subordinate 


-  In this sense ,  the leader is somewhat like the baseball star who every new group of spectators expects will hit  home run 


-  ,  Supervision and individualized consideration should be preventive as well as remedial 


-  The transformational leader should not limit doses of stimulation and motivation to periods after troubles have cropped up and the salesperson is in  slump 


-  ,  Field sales managers must spend considerable time with salespeople in their territories ,  visiting them and their families ,  holding private sessions ,  analyzing call reports ,  and extending simple understanding and warmth 


-  Coaching is  teaching technique for imparting facts and methods for accomplishing  task 


-  ,  Whereas coaching and counseling are forms of occasional individualized consideration ,  mentoring is  more permanent type of guidance with the follower serving as  protg of the leader 


-  Chuck Harris is another mentor who believes in leading by example 


-  ,   capable leader strives to make followers comfortable through his or her own charisma ,  intellectual stimulation ,  individualized consideration ,  and contingent rewards 


-  Favoring  particular type of prospect ,  preferring  prospecting method ,  avoiding  structured sales presentation ,  disliking  commission-based compensation plan ,  being afraid to ask for  high enough price  these are all manifestations of  given salespersons comfort zone 


-  The behavior of the six subordinate managers of the transactional leader is based on contingent rewards ,  management by exception ,  and few signs of intellectual stimulation ,  warmth ,  personal direction ,  or one-on-one consideration 


-  ,  Typically ,  both methods feature the use of the Multifactor Leadership QuestionnaireTM  ( MLQ )  developed by Bernard Bass ,  Bruce Avolio ,  and colleagues 


-  ,  There are several successful programs designed to enhance transformational leadership skills regardless of an employees current skill level 


-  Individuals who have no prior knowledge of transformational and charismatic behaviors can acquire them 


-  They explain the underlying philosophy of transformational leadership 


-  Then the programs give its key components  ( charismatic leadership ,  individualized consideration ,  and intellectual stimulation )  and the enhanced individual ,  team ,  and organizational outcomes that result from transformational leadership 


-  In fact ,  Bass and his colleagues have demonstrated repeatedly the success of these transformational leadership training and development programs 


-  We must also question whether all incumbents in sales organizations are seeking the changes that transformational leadership will bring about 


-  Our widespread but informal observations of sales subordinates job satisfaction and bottom-line sales results also suggest the desirability of adding transformational to the transactional leadership that may already exist in most sales organizations
