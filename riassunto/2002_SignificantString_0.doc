- Most managers today understand the strategic implications of the information-based ,  knowledge-driven ,  service-intensive economy 


-  Worse still ,  in many companies only marginal managerial attention  if that is focused on the problems of employee capability and motivation 


-  ,  Having studied more than 20 companies in the process of trying to transform themselves ,  we have concluded that although structure is undoubtedly an impediment to the process ,  an even bigger barrier is managers outdated understanding of strategy 


-  ,  In the competitive-strategy model in which many of todays leaders were trained ,  sophisticated strategic-planning systems were supposed to help senior managers decide which businesses to grow and which to harvest 


-  Unfortunately ,  all the planning and investment were unable to stop the competition from imitating or leapfrogging their carefully developed product-market positions 


-  By definition ,  competency-based strategies are dependent on people: Scarce knowledge and expertise drive new-product development ,  and personal relationships with key clients are at the core of flexible market responsiveness 


-  And however hard it is to change the organization ,  it is even harder to change the orientation and mind-set of its senior managers 


-  ,  The hardest mind-set to alter is the longstanding ,  deeply embedded belief that capital is the critical strategic resource to be managed and that senior managers key responsibilities should center around its acquisition ,  allocation and effective use 


-  When it values  mature ,  capital-intensive company like GE at 10 times its book value ,  it is seeing something of greater worth than the physical assets recorded in financial accounts 


-  But recruiting difficulties that large traditional companies face ,  employees eroding sense of loyalty and cynicism over the growing gap between the compensation of those at the top and those on the front lines all indicate that value distribution must change 


-  That means creating  sense of purpose that not only provides an integrating framework for bottom-up strategic initiatives ,  but also injects meaning into individual effort 


-  It means articulating company values that not only align organizational effort with the overall enterprise objectives ,  but also define  community to which individuals want to belong 


-  In the 1980s era of competitive-strategy analysis ,  their function was typically supportive and administrative 


-  That is something McKinsey does unusually well ,  which helps to explain why  


-  Yet in most companies ,  the human-resources department focuses considerable effort on planting ,  staking ,  watering and fertilizing  and practically none on cutting out deadwood or growth-inhibiting underbrush 


-  Information technologists may help in organizing data and making it accessible ,  but they must be teamed up with  and operate in support of  those who understand human motivation and social interaction 


-  Because that requires an understanding of organization design ,  process management ,  interpersonal relationships and trust-based culture ,  it calls for leadership from sophisticated human-resources professionals who also have  strong understanding of the business 


-  The reengineered processes  ( whether at  micro level ,  as in order entry ,  or  macro level ,  as in new-product development )  had two major objectives: breaking down hierarchical barriers to rapid decision making ,  and opening up new horizontal channels and forums for cross-unit communication and collaboration 


-  Such advice flies in the face of conventional wisdom ,  which maintains loyalty has been replaced by  free-agent talent market that requires companies to convert their long-term trust-based relationships with employees to short-term contracts 


-  ,  In an industry featuring high pressure and burnout as the norm ,  SAS Institute has created an island of common sense 


-  Actions and decisions are based on four simple principles: to treat everyone equally and fairly ,  to trust people to do  good job ,  to think long term and to practice bottom-up decision making 


-  And for these self-selected individuals ,  that is reason enough to want to spend their career at SAS 


-  ,  But the bonding process involves more than creating  sense of identity and belonging 


-  The role of the HR professional is to get senior managers to move beyond hollow ,  slogan-driven communications ,  which are more likely to lead to detached cynicism than to engaged motivation ,  and to help them develop  clear personal commitment to an organizational purpose 


-  He wants to feel angry about the pain and loss the disease is causing and passionate about the need to help 


-  And he wants to transmit that passion to those working at Genzyme 


-  After much debate ,  the partners decided that the changes occurring in the world of business were significant enough for them to reconsider the core purpose of their firm
