- Recent research on multimarket contact  the partial overlap of two firms geographic or product markets  has stimulated new thinking about how and why firms put pressure on each other 


-  Not surprisingly ,  overlaps put pressure on competitors and escalate the rivalry between firms in chess-like matches for control 


-  But under certain conditions ,  overlapping markets can also create reciprocal threats that cause firms to reduce their rival-rous behavior 


-  By exchanging footholds  ( moderate market share positions )  in one anothers important markets ,  two firms can create mutual forbearance   lesser propensity to attack each other with aggressive price ,  advertising or innovation wars for fear of damaging counterattacks in other important markets  and  greater inclination to seek growth in nonoverlapping markets 


-  ,  Most firms dont do  good job of managing ,  through competitor and market selection ,  the pressure they experience 


-  All organizations sense pressure intuitively ,  but it is often difficult to see the overall pressure system   complex ,  shifting pattern of overlapping contacts among rivals that continually alters the climate of an industry by changing the incentives for players to compete ,  mutually forbear or even formally cooperate 


-  Fortunately ,  these systems can be mapped and ,  unlike weather pressure systems ,  controlled to  significant extent if they are understood well enough 


-  ,  Typically ,  the competitive pressure within an industry is thought of as  continuum ,  running from hypercompetition to collusion 


-  An industrys competitiveness is traditionally measured by antitrust experts using an industrys concentration ratio or Herfindahl index ,  both based on the distribution of the market shares of firms within the industry 


-  But recent multimarket research indicates that competitive pressure is more complicated than that 


-  Overlaps between different pairs of competitors vary widely ,  reducing or escalating rivalry differently 


-  And pressure is asymmetrical that is ,  the pressure firm  places on firm  does not necessarily equal the pressure that firm  puts on firm  ,  because their overlapping markets may differ in importance to each ones portfolio 


-  Each firm in  system is uniquely affected 


-  Some are targets ,  whereas others are aggressors or orchestrators of the overall pattern of pressure 


-  Still others are isolated from the brunt of pressure 


-  With all the possible combinations of overlaps that can exist between numerous rivals ,  no two pressure systems are exactly alike ,  even if the traditional measures of industry competitiveness are identical 


-  )  ,  As difficult as it is ,  it is vitally important for an organization to understand its industrys pressure system 


-  Otherwise it can find itself the industrys lightning rod ,  attracting attacks from all quarters 


-  It obviously cant avoid competitive pressure by cooperating with every competitor in all markets: Thats illegal 


-  Nor can it put pressure on every competitor everywhere: Thats suicide 


-  Managers must understand how to use competitive pressure to create an optimum combination of competition and cooperation among selected rivals 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  managers almost always lack objective measurements and useful pictures of the pressure patterns they face 


-  Typically ,  strategists see competitive pressure as being based on five forces: buyer power ,  supplier power ,  barriers to entry ,  threats posed by substitute products and intraindustry rivalry 


-  Measurement of intraindustry rivalry has been proxied by factors affecting the degree of price competition in  market ,  such as the number and concentration of competitors ,  the rate of growth in demand ,  the industrys capital intensity and fixed costs ,  the lack of differentiation ,  switching costs ,  the diversity of strategic groups within the industry and the magnitude of exit barriers 


-  However ,  none of these factors explicitly accounts for the complexities presented by recent multimarket contact research nor for the variety of pressure patterns that comprise and influence intraindustry rivalry 


-  ,   map based on measured pressures is essential to answering questions vital to the dynamic stability of an industry and the profitability of firms in it 


-  It has important implications for an organizations market and competitor selection ,  growth plans ,  product portfolio and diversification strategy ,  resource allocation priorities ,  competitive intelligence system ,  merger and acquisition strategy ,  and scenario planning process 


-  ,  An overall picture of an industrys pressure system can allow managers to proactively and intelligently decide whether to counter the pressure of  rival or let another competitor do it 


-  Organizations can apply pressure to mold the strategies of others and even to create win-win situations in which both rivals advance or protect their positions 


-  They can tailor their selection of markets or competitors in ways that legally redirect pressure ,  create mutual forbearance or encourage indirect competition 


-  They can avoid entering attractive growth markets that will bring on intense retaliatory pressure from unexpected quarters 


-  When used moderately ,  these tactics can prevent an industry from becoming  pressure cooker 


-  Or they can heat things up when opportunities for capturing or holding industry leadership arise 


-  ,  For any organization ,  measuring and mapping the invisible pattern of competitive pressure among its rivals is the first step in creating order out of the confusion that is destroying the profitability of many highly competitive industries 


-  Because of frequent internal destabilizing actions and occasional external shocks ,  pressure systems can never be frozen 


-  Companies must seek superior position when possible and avoid intolerable pressure when necessary  but it is most valuable to gain superior strategic influence over the evolution of the system 


-  ,  The more two firms product or geographic markets overlap ,  the more pressure they exert on each other 


-  The pressure is proportional to the importance of markets to each firm and the degree of penetration by each firm 


-  This simple concept enables organizations to quantify the degree of pressure that one rival puts on another 


-  )  ,  When measuring and mapping competitive pressure ,  it is not easy to define ,  on an  priori basis ,  the boundaries of or key players in an industry 


-  It is best to do this empirically by beginning with all competitors whose markets overlap significantly with the focal firm  ( the one creating the map )  and then including firms that pressure those competitors 


-  The primary purpose of pressure mapping is not to illustrate the current use of competitive tactics  (  


-  ,  price ,  advertising or innovation wars )  but to provide insight about who has the potential and the incentive to make or avoid future use of pressure 


-  By casting the net wide ,  it is possible to find tacit allies and to identify potential acquisitions or opportunities to enter new markets that could shift the balance and direction of pressure applied to selected rivals 


-  The mapping is based on hard market share and revenue data that are often readily available in marketing ,  competitive intelligence or strategic planning groups 


-  It is often useful to locate the most focal firm or the most aggressive or targeted rival at the center of the map ,  or to place the industry leaders at the top of the map to minimize the number of intersecting arrows 


-  ,  Consider the airline industry as it existed in the early 1990s 


-  While the industry at that time appeared highly competitive to most observers ,  closer investigation reveals embedded patterns of pressure that mixed incentives to compete and cooperate 


-  )  ,  The map reflects that the industry leaders in the early 1990s were American ,  United and Delta  collectively known as the Big Three Supercarriers 


-  These three had deep pockets and large hub-and-spoke systems with economies of scale and wider connectivity than the other carriers 


-  Second-tier players were large national carriers that were not leaders for  variety of reasons 


-  Some were financially weakened by  combination of hostile unions and excessive post-deregulation growth or competition  ( Continental and Eastern )  


-  Two low-cost niche players had arisen after deregulation: America West and Southwest 


-  America West was built on  hub-and-spoke system ,  whereas Southwest focused on direct flights to secondary airports 


-  Local and regional players ,  like Aloha and Alaska Airlines ,  were engaged in  struggle for the same geographic markets 


-  And parts of the industry were suffering from aggressive ,  sporadic  ( some might even say almost continuous )  price wars in the late 1980s and early 1990s 


-  Fierce turf battles were being played out as competitors entered each others markets ,  resulting in numerous overlapping geographic markets that had not existed at the time of deregulation in the early 80s 


-  ,  When interpreting any pressure map ,  it is often helpful to start by looking at the current position and behavior of the industry leaders 


-  Is there one firm  ( or  dominant coalition of firms )  that seems to be applying  lot of pressure? Are the leaders aggressively applying pressure among themselves or just against lesser firms? Has  leader applied pressure that is so great it constitutes  major invasion or are the leaders avoiding contact by taking only minor positions in each others markets? Is the pressure exchanged between the leaders asymmetrical or balanced in intensity? Such questions naturally lead to others: Why are they acting as they do? Are there any explicit ,  implicit or even unconscious strategies unfolding? Who is central to the evolution of the system ,  driving the actions and position of others? ,  It is also useful to look for subsystems composed of smaller numbers of firms tightly organized in pairs or triangular relationships to see how their interdependence influences their behavior 


-  Triangles may involve formal alliances or multimarket contacts that create mutual forbearance between all or just two of the members 


-  The subset of firms may act as  united bloc ,  have  central player that influences the other two ,  or two members that share the third as  common rival 


-  Delta has taken large market share in markets important to Eastern ,  but Eastern has taken only minor positions in Deltas important markets ,  giving Delta the advantage 


-  Delta lacks incentive to forbear with respect to Easterns markets unless Eastern were to take some moderate footholds in Deltas most important markets  ( an opportunity that Eastern missed )  


-  In contrast ,  Delta and American each have moderate positions of about equal strength in the others markets 


-  These hostage markets are not big enough to create  struggle over identical turf ,  as between Southwest and America West ,  but just enough to restrain Delta and American from attacking each other aggressively 


-  ,  This type of mutual opposing and equally balanced pressure does not completely eliminate competition between two rivals ,  but has the potential to redirect it in two important ways 


-  Second ,  rigorous research in numerous highly competitive industries has shown that firms pressuring each other in this way often improve their profitability ,  avoid further expansion in the overlapping rivals markets ,  limit aggressive actions to the rivals least important markets ,  and focus on growth elsewhere 


-  Rivals may even give up share in their weak markets in exchange for greater share in their strong markets so they both gain economies of scale 


- 10 ,  Looking at the third leg of the triangle ,  the mutual forbearance between American and Delta also influences the American-Eastern relationship 


-  In fact ,  after Eastern ceased operations in 1991 ,  Delta benefited by picking up many of Easterns markets ,  giving it control of some safe haven airports 


-  ,  Examining the pressure map of the early 90s airline industry ,  one can see that several subsystems shaped how the industry consolidated and which carriers survived 


-  There were four principal dynamic forces at work: Two-directional pressure between American and Delta and between American and United created  triumvirate of mutual forbearance that freed each company to put pressure on the second-tier players without the threat of intervention by another supercarrier 


-  This further allowed each to focus its resources on one or two targeted carriers at most and enabled  downward pressure cascade ,  which tends to cause market consolidation 


-  American was in  central position in the pressure system and played the role of enforcer 


-  Whenever Delta and United acted against each other  ( because they lacked incentives for mutual forbearance )  ,  American was caught in the crossfire ,  forced to defend its interests and perhaps even to use disciplinary actions 


-  These included the use or the threat of temporary but punishing market entries and price-based retaliation to keep the rest of the Big Three focused on the second tier rather than on one another 


-  ,  Between 1990 and 1995 ,  as  result of these dynamic forces ,  Eastern ,  Pan Am and Braniff all but disappeared 


-  US Airways acquired its main competitor ,  Piedmont ,  but was never financially strong enough to make  play for  leadership position in the industry 


-  And Southwest won the low-cost niche ,  defeating America West and Midway 


-  ,  By 1995 ,  the original three-tier hierarchical pattern of pressure had consolidated into  stable power-sharing among the three supercarriers in which each dominated domestic hubs where the other two dared not expand ,  thereby improving profitability for each 


-  )  To perpetuate this favorable pressure system ,  they needed to stay out of each others most profitable turf and to refrain from placing further pressure on the remaining non-supercarriers to avoid antitrust issues 


-  The non-supercarriers moved into the domestic territories not occupied by the Big Three ,  avoided aggressive competition in the supercarriers hub cities ,  or established positions in the less-traveled foreign routes to Asia or Latin America 


-  The price wars of the early 90s disappeared ,  and industry profits shifted from  $13 


-  ,  Funded by  stable home front ,  the supercarriers shifted their attention to the transatlantic market through alliances with European carriers ,  eventually dividing the market about equally 


-  They launched their own Web sites and cooperated to create  joint Web site  ( Orbitz 


- com )  ,  selling airline tickets at  discount to put pressure on potential disrupters of the current pressure system ,  such as Priceline 


-  With roughly equal market share and deep pockets ,  the Big Three competed only indirectly through international growth and improved operational efficiency from greater volume funneled from overseas 


-  The pressure system remained more or less in equilibrium until the external shock caused by the events of September 11 destabilized it 


-  ,  In any industry ,  companies can develop competitive strategy by using  pressure map to answer two critical questions: If the current pressure pattern continues ,  what position will my firm ultimately hold? How can my firm stabilize or shift the direction of pressure to reduce  ( or enhance )  the predicted impact of the current pressure system? ,  Had the airline industrys second-tier carriers asked these questions ,  for instance ,  they could have countered the four principal dynamics that enabled the Big Three to control the downward flow of pressure 


-  For example ,  the second-tier players could have weakened Americans enforcer role by attacking it from all directions 


-  If American were besieged ,  the other super-carriers may have joined in the attack because an overwhelmed American could no longer enforce its threatened use of hostage markets 


-  While it may seem implausible that simultaneous attacks by small players could vanquish an industry leader ,  it happens frequently 


-  ,  Alternatively ,  some of the second-tier carriers could have consolidated and attacked the markets exchanged as hostages among two of the Big Three 


-  By combining as one major player ,  they could also have worked to establish their own mutual forbearance with some of the supercarriers 


-  As  third possibility ,  Eastern ,  which was once one of the largest airlines in the world ,  might have moved to undermine the triangle formed by American and Delta by reallocating its routes to create mutual forbearance with at least one of those players 


-  ,  Whether  company is the beneficiary or the victim of the pressure system in its industry ,  it can intervene to alter that system and gain strategic advantage through competitor and market selection ,  mergers and acquisitions or formal alliances ,  and other powerful strategic tools described below 


-  Depending on the situation ,  the goal may be either to stabilize the current system or to destabilize it and redirect the existing pressure patterns 


-  ,  In 19th-century Europe ,  royal families cooperated in what was known as  concert of powers to control disruptive nations while continuing to compete among themselves for colonies ,  economic power and influence 


-  In business ,  most industries have only  few leaders and they frequently exhibit  similar dynamic ,  as evidenced by the preceding airline industry example 


-  ,  Similar to the great power nations of world history ,  industry leaders generally prefer stable systems and employ five time-tested mechanisms to achieve that stability: checks and balances; tit for tat; shared power systems; polarized blocs; and collective security arrangements 


- 11 Over time ,  the use of these mechanisms signals each leaders tolerances and limitations to the others 


-  These mechanisms are used in sequence or in combination ,  depending upon the financial and strategic capability and will of an industrys leaders to carry them out 


-  ,  Industry leaders simultaneously use competitive pressure to hold ambitious competitors in check either by containing ,  constricting or undermining their growth and economic power 


-  Similarly ,  to support its Java programming language ,  Sun Microsystems organized an informal everybody-but-Microsoft alliance of software and hardware makers in the 90s to check the power of Microsofts ActiveX language 


-  ,  Individual leaders sequentially discipline potential rivals when they threaten the current pressure pattern ,  as American Airlines did when it acted as enforcer during the early 90s ,  using selective fare wars to keep the other supercarriers off its turf 


-  This pattern began at Texas airports during the 80s when American played tit for tat against Braniff and Texas Air ,  two Texas-based airlines whose strong growth strategies threatened to preempt Americans home base in the Dallas/Fort Worth hub 


-  ,  Leaders achieve  consensus that no major competitor will attempt to disrupt the pressure system ,  as the Big Three Supercarriers did in the late 1990s 


-  However ,  if one of the leaders gains too much power ,  it will be ostracized and lose its influence 


-  For example ,  Sony and Philips Electronics have evolved  power-sharing arrangement that has both tacit and explicit aspects 


-  Sony has traditionally focused on the United States and Asia ,  while Philips has dominance in Europe and Latin America 


-  The two share power over traditional Asian fast followers and component suppliers 


-  Recently ,  the two companies entered into an agreement to develop  joint operating system for digital consumer-electronic systems that will network home computers ,  television ,  video games ,  personal digital assistants ,  home appliances and audio equipment 


-  It remains to be seen if Philips recent troubles with high manufacturing costs and downsizing will make Philips  junior partner in the power-sharing arrangement 


-  It also remains to be seen if Matsushita will be invited to adopt the Sony-Philips standard ,  forgoing historic rivalries to fend off the computing hardware makers that are converging on the digital appliance and home server markets 


-  ,  These are modified shared-power systems 


-  When there are two or more leaders in an industry ,  they can enter into shared power arrangements in separate blocs of opposing alliances 


-  Unlike shared power systems ,   polarized bloc may include industry nonleaders 


-  Nonleaders that align with  bloc benefit from preferred relationships within the bloc ,  but can be ostracized if they refuse to take sides or prove disloyal 


-  Their blocs include other beverage makers that distribute or bottle using the blocs as alliance partners ,  suppliers ,  bottlers ,  consultants and advertising agencies 


-  This bloc system helped Coca-Cola and Pepsico contain Cadbury Schweppes attempt to form  new major player during the 1980s and 1990s 


-  ,  These stabilize relationships among industry leaders and among lesser firms by giving all players an incentive for peaceful coexistence 


-  Leaders in digital hardware  ( such as Nokia ,  IBM ,  Intel ,  Motorola ,  Toshiba and Lucent )  as well as hundreds of less powerful firms  ( such as Acer ,  AMD ,  and Delco )  have formed  collective security arrangement around Bluetooth ,   designer and manufacturer of chips that enable short-distance ,  digital wireless connections 


-  By spring 2000 ,  more than  , 800 companies had agreed to use Bluetooths technology 


-  The ostensible benefit for everyone is universal connectivity among all the devices that they make ,  but the other benefit is stability in the relationships among these players 


-  Even if Bluetooth does not survive as the supplier of choice ,  it is unlikely that any single ambitious player will be able to use  new digital wireless technology to disrupt the status quo 


-  ,  An organization that is not benefiting from an existing pressure system or will not benefit from that systems current path of evolution may want to destabilize it and redirect pressure among its rivals 


-  This requires two crucial strategic choices: selection of the appropriate allies and selection of the appropriate target (  )  


-  ,  Interventions in  pressure system ,  based on alliances and targeting ,  can be used to signal dissatisfaction with the position or moves of  rival 


-  They can also be used to entice ,  pin down or distract  competitor in certain markets 


-  They can mold the market selection strategy of  rival ,  establish the borders between the market domains of two firms ,  force another player to converge on or diverge from  position ,  or eliminate  player or the allies of others 


-  And targeting can create mutual forbearance or natural alliances between those with common rivals 


-  ,  Allies should be selected to establish at least one of five clear types of alliances  each with  different strategic intent 


-  Allies can be surrogate attackers that help  company conserve its own resources by putting pressure on  desired target 


-  They can be critical supporters that help the company apply pressure to  common rival or passive supporters that refrain from pressuring the company while it puts pressure on another firm 


-  In its early days ,  Microsoft used Apple and then Intel as strategic umbrellas ,  inhibiting IBM from squashing Microsoft before it became strong enough to stand on its own 


-  Once IBM realized that Microsoft was  threat ,  IBMs actions were inhibited by the potential reactions of the umbrella firms with which Microsoft had alliances 


-  These five types of alliances can be established informally by signaling through public announcements or by applying pressure to create mutual forbearance ,  or they can be created formally through joint ventures and long-term contracts 


-  ,  Desired alliance partners often ignore suitors overtures if they do not currently share interest in  common target or  common vision for the pressure systems future 


-  Public signals or formal offers of alliance must be preceded by competitive pressure to put teeth into the signal or offer 


-  Methods for realigning the willingness of others to ally  ( or accept common targets )  include the divide and conquer ,  balancer and assimilator strategies 


-  Coca-Cola did this when it severed Pepsicos 50-year Venezuelan distribution partnership with the Cisneros family by convincing the family to sign  more lucrative deal with Coke 


-  Pepsicos market share in its only real foothold in South America fell from 42% to zero overnight 


-  American Airlines also used  divide-and-conquer strategy when it forced the breakup of  US Airways-British Airways alliance upon making its own controversial alliance with British Airways for transatlantic travelers 


-  Resistance from government agencies in the United States and Europe ultimately gutted the power of the American-British Airways alliance ,  but American kept the alliance ,  perhaps to block British Airways from forming an alliance with one of the other Big Three 


-  ,   balancer throws its weight back and forth between rivals ,  enabling it  ( or the firm that encouraged it to get into the balancing act )  to influence the rivals positioning and movement 


-  Winning the contract depends upon the support of radar and avionics suppliers  (  


-  Their influence is considerable because contract awards are typically all or nothing 


-  Assimilation can be accomplished through merger and acquisition or through exclusive supply or distribution contracts 


-  Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy saw this as an assimilation strategy to squeeze his company ,  since Suns biggest business at the time was selling Suns Solaris Unix operating systems to communications companies ,  its largest customer segment 


-   company may want to take on its biggest threat ,  the weakest of the major players ,   rising or aggressive player ,  or  competitor that doesnt pressure it directly but represents an attractive market 


-  The choice usually depends on the targeting firms goal for the pressure systems future pattern ,  the feasibility of the action and the opportunities that present themselves 


-  Despite coming late to the market ,  by 2001 AOL had attained the number three position in  fragmented market with three other leaders: number one T-Online  ( based in Germany )  ,  number two Tiscali  ( Italy )  and number four Wanadoo  ( France )  


-  T-Online ,   Deutsche Telekom  ( DT )  subsidiary ,  is by far the largest European ISP and holds the leadership position in its home market because its service is provided ,  by default ,  to DT subscribers 


-  million users 


-  Growing-but-weak Tiscali has made numerous small acquisitions in 15 countries ,  but it holds only the number three or four position and has low brand recognition in most of them 


-  In its home market ,  it holds only the fifth spot 


-  Wanadoo has  strong position in its home market ,  as well as  strong position in the United Kingdom because of its acquisition of Freeserve ,  the countrys top ISP 


-  ,  In this case ,  AOL had several options: Attack or acquire into the leaders  ( T-Onlines )  home market; target markets not important to T-Online; go after the home market of the most vulnerable player  ( Tiscali )  or target no one and grow diffusely across Europe 


-  AOL is exerting significant effort in Germany ,  packaging its content to keep its users online  


-  to  times longer  ( by different estimates )  than T-Online users ,  suing DT over its allegedly favorable telephone rates for T-Online users in Germany and using massive ad campaigns to capture German users 


-  Because T-Online lacks any counter-pressure through  foothold in AOLs home ISP market  ( the United States )  ,  AOL has not been constrained from its aggressive efforts 


-  ,  Most industry leaders prefer to fight small battles rather than large ,  risky ones ,  so they target the most vulnerable player 


-  It is often better for  company to redirect pressure away from itself or to weaken several players simultaneously than to eliminate the weakest player ,  because the latter scenario leaves major competitors capable of exerting  lot of pressure 


-  Not targeting the weakest player may leave more rivals on the field ,  but each with reduced focus and power 


-  ,  Consider General Motors position in the automobile industry 


-  Its home market is the United States ,  but it has  strong foothold in Europe  ( its Opel division )  


-  GM could target the weakest global player ,  DaimlerChrysler ,  which is in financial difficulty ,  but it would still face two powerful competitors  ( Ford and Toyota )  


-  Or it could target the strongest competitor on each continent: Ford in the  


-  But in the unlikely event that GM succeeds ,  it would become the undisputed global leader ,  facing three weakened competitors 


-  ,  The at-a-glance information in  pressure map can be greatly enhanced in  number of ways 


-  Safe havens  ( relatively uncontested markets )  ,  formal alliances and an industrys stabilizing mechanisms can be shown graphically 


-  Interior circles can be included that are proportional to the size of  company in the markets being considered or in its home geographic or key product market 


-  The arrows can be color-coded to reflect relative advantage in price ,  advertising ,  innovation quality or service 


-  Dotted arrows can be added to indicate the migration of the players to markets outside of the industry ,  with the size of the dotted arrow representing the magnitude of resources being devoted to the move 


-  ,  An enhanced pressure map can concisely present  considerable amount of information about the balance of power in an industry 


-  Look ,  for example ,  at the industry landscape that was created when  


- -based Vodafone acquired Germanys Mannesmann in June 2000 ,  forming  pan-European giant with $24 billion in revenues and 34 million customers  in an industry that had previously been operated by nationally dominant state-owned or -regulated firms 


-  )  ,  In 2002 ,  Vodafone is the undisputed industry leader with lower subscriber acquisition costs and greater economies of scale and connectivity than its competitors 


-  It has strong ,  positive free cash flow and holds strong positions  approximately one-third of the home market  against each of the national wireless leaders in Germany  ( DT )  ,  Italy  ( Telecom Italia )  and Spain  ( Telefonica )  


-  Its partnership with Vivendi ,  SBC Communications and British Telecom ,  called SFR ,  holds  third of the French market against France Telecoms Orange A/S 


-  ,  The enhanced pressure map of the wireless industry helps make sense of  seemingly simple situation that has triggered complex maneuvers with sometimes-obscure rationales 


-  On the surface ,  the map indicates clearly that ,  in 2001 ,  players such as British Telecom ,  France Telecoms Orange A/S and DT were on the defensive and had to counter Vodafone if they wished to avoid becoming second-tier players 


-  The simple solution  an assimilation strategy  would have been to merge their mobile operations ,  attract several smaller players and form another pan-European mobile telecom ,   powerful counter-balancing rival to Vodafone ,  thereby creating two polarized blocs in the European wireless industry 


-  But this strategy would have been politically impossible ,  given the current nationalistic regulation of European telephone companies 


-  ,  Analysis of the map also suggests that the players could check and balance Vodafone in more complex ,  but still effective ,  ways 


-  That seems to have been the chosen strategy ,  and ,  in 2002 ,  Vodafone has begun to feel the counter-pressure 


-  In Germany ,  Vodafone faces  strong defensive counterattack from DT 


-  Vodafone lost 400 , 000 subscribers in that country in the first quarter of 2002 alone 


-  market ,  Vodafone is in  tight market-share race with British Telecoms Cellnet  ( rebranded mmO2 )  ,  France Telecoms Orange A/S ,  and DT-owned One2One  ( rebranded T-Mobile )  


-  Given its active defense in Germany ,  DT is aggressively attacking and taking market share in the United Kingdom ,  unfettered by fear of Vodafone retaliating in the German market 


-  France Telecoms Orange A/S is even more aggressive ,  attacking Vodafone in the United Kingdom ,  unconstrained by fear of counterattack in its home market where it holds 43% market share 


-  ,  Vodafone appears to be trying to hold its market share position against British Telecom and France Telecoms Orange A/S in the  


-  Meanwhile ,  Vodafones strategy seems to include attacking Telecom Italia  its financially strongest opponent but lacking the multimarket contact to counterattack elsewhere  and Telefonica ,  which has demonstrated  lack of commitment to Europe by migrating excessively  ( dotted arrow )  to Latin America 


-  ,  The SFR alliance ,  originally conceived as  counterbalancing move against France Telecom by two British firms  ( Vodafone and British Telecom )  ,  is troubled by the conflicting interests of its partners ,  including an intense rivalry between Vodafone and British Telecom in their home market and Vivendis redeployment of resources to the entertainment industry 


-  Vodafone was reported to be interested in buying out Vivendis stake13  perhaps to make SFR an aggressive counterbalance against Orange A/S in France once again  and British Telecom has indicated its willingness to sell out as well 


-  ,  In addition ,  Vodafone is reportedly considering exiting its joint venture with Verizon in the  


-  wireless market to bring cash home to support its European initiative 


-  This may be necessary because of the rising counterpressure from rivals ,  the fear of  consolidation of several rivals if political conditions were to permit ,  and the need for funds  ( for initiatives such as  


-  ,  The European wireless industry illustrates how an enhanced pressure map can enable what if  exercises and contingency planning ,  allowing all players to anticipate with greater accuracy the outcomes of their own or others potential strategies 


-  In fact ,  if Vodafones competitors had used pressure mapping to do what-if analyses ,  it might have stimulated  more aggressive preemptive assimilation or alliance strategy among them before Vodafone acquired Mannesmann 


-  But ,  by using competitive pressure maps and  systems approach to understanding the dynamic patterns underlying multimarket contacts within an industry ,  competitors can make  good plan for making contact with enemies and allies alike 


-  ,  Systems of mixed cooperation ,  competition and forbearance exist in every industry and are not necessarily anticompetitive ,  collusive oligopolies 


-  In fact ,  if used properly ,  pressure mapping can actually reduce the temptation to collude ,  drive industry growth to new heights and in new directions through increased indirect competition ,  and make room for clever small players that act as balancers or members of polarized blocs and collective security agreements 


-  In the end ,  use of pressure and mutual forbearance must be responsible and tailored to avoid violation of antitrust and any other relevant national laws 


-  As with any strategy ,  companies should use their ability to change the pressure situation in their industries for the greater good of shareholders ,  customers and society as  whole 


-  ,  Although the general logic and strategy of pressure systems will apply to  wide variety of situations involving geographic and product markets ,  there are industries in which pressure patterns are obvious and maps may not be revealing 


-  Still ,  evidence of significant profit impact from pressure based on multimarket contacts has been found for industries as diverse as banking , 14 cement , 15 hotels , 16 knitwear manufacturing , 17 mobile telephone service18 and petroleum19  on both the global and local levels 


-  ,  Of course ,  competitive pressure is not the only force that affects profitability and survival 


-  Major discontinuities ,  such as terrorism or technological revolution ,  can destroy even the most stabilized systems 


-  And firms can implode from labor problems ,  poor management and implementation errors that shift the balance of power among the players to stronger players outside the current leadership 


-  ,  The changing nature of industries and the external forces that affect them suggest that pressure systems require constant reexamination 


-  Indeed ,  if several maps done at periodic intervals are viewed electronically in rapid sequence ,  like an animated film ,  an industry can be seen evolving ,  providing  powerful and visceral understanding of how the world is moving and how the pressure is flowing
