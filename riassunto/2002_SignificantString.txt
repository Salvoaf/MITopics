- Recent research on multimarket contact  the partial overlap of two firms geographic or product markets  has stimulated new thinking about how and why firms put pressure on each other 


-  Not surprisingly ,  overlaps put pressure on competitors and escalate the rivalry between firms in chess-like matches for control 


-  But under certain conditions ,  overlapping markets can also create reciprocal threats that cause firms to reduce their rival-rous behavior 


-  By exchanging footholds  ( moderate market share positions )  in one anothers important markets ,  two firms can create mutual forbearance   lesser propensity to attack each other with aggressive price ,  advertising or innovation wars for fear of damaging counterattacks in other important markets  and  greater inclination to seek growth in nonoverlapping markets 


-  ,  Most firms dont do  good job of managing ,  through competitor and market selection ,  the pressure they experience 


-  All organizations sense pressure intuitively ,  but it is often difficult to see the overall pressure system   complex ,  shifting pattern of overlapping contacts among rivals that continually alters the climate of an industry by changing the incentives for players to compete ,  mutually forbear or even formally cooperate 


-  Fortunately ,  these systems can be mapped and ,  unlike weather pressure systems ,  controlled to  significant extent if they are understood well enough 


-  ,  Typically ,  the competitive pressure within an industry is thought of as  continuum ,  running from hypercompetition to collusion 


-  An industrys competitiveness is traditionally measured by antitrust experts using an industrys concentration ratio or Herfindahl index ,  both based on the distribution of the market shares of firms within the industry 


-  But recent multimarket research indicates that competitive pressure is more complicated than that 


-  Overlaps between different pairs of competitors vary widely ,  reducing or escalating rivalry differently 


-  And pressure is asymmetrical that is ,  the pressure firm  places on firm  does not necessarily equal the pressure that firm  puts on firm  ,  because their overlapping markets may differ in importance to each ones portfolio 


-  Each firm in  system is uniquely affected 


-  Some are targets ,  whereas others are aggressors or orchestrators of the overall pattern of pressure 


-  Still others are isolated from the brunt of pressure 


-  With all the possible combinations of overlaps that can exist between numerous rivals ,  no two pressure systems are exactly alike ,  even if the traditional measures of industry competitiveness are identical 


-  )  ,  As difficult as it is ,  it is vitally important for an organization to understand its industrys pressure system 


-  Otherwise it can find itself the industrys lightning rod ,  attracting attacks from all quarters 


-  It obviously cant avoid competitive pressure by cooperating with every competitor in all markets: Thats illegal 


-  Nor can it put pressure on every competitor everywhere: Thats suicide 


-  Managers must understand how to use competitive pressure to create an optimum combination of competition and cooperation among selected rivals 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  managers almost always lack objective measurements and useful pictures of the pressure patterns they face 


-  Typically ,  strategists see competitive pressure as being based on five forces: buyer power ,  supplier power ,  barriers to entry ,  threats posed by substitute products and intraindustry rivalry 


-  Measurement of intraindustry rivalry has been proxied by factors affecting the degree of price competition in  market ,  such as the number and concentration of competitors ,  the rate of growth in demand ,  the industrys capital intensity and fixed costs ,  the lack of differentiation ,  switching costs ,  the diversity of strategic groups within the industry and the magnitude of exit barriers 


-  However ,  none of these factors explicitly accounts for the complexities presented by recent multimarket contact research nor for the variety of pressure patterns that comprise and influence intraindustry rivalry 


-  ,   map based on measured pressures is essential to answering questions vital to the dynamic stability of an industry and the profitability of firms in it 


-  It has important implications for an organizations market and competitor selection ,  growth plans ,  product portfolio and diversification strategy ,  resource allocation priorities ,  competitive intelligence system ,  merger and acquisition strategy ,  and scenario planning process 


-  ,  An overall picture of an industrys pressure system can allow managers to proactively and intelligently decide whether to counter the pressure of  rival or let another competitor do it 


-  Organizations can apply pressure to mold the strategies of others and even to create win-win situations in which both rivals advance or protect their positions 


-  They can tailor their selection of markets or competitors in ways that legally redirect pressure ,  create mutual forbearance or encourage indirect competition 


-  They can avoid entering attractive growth markets that will bring on intense retaliatory pressure from unexpected quarters 


-  When used moderately ,  these tactics can prevent an industry from becoming  pressure cooker 


-  Or they can heat things up when opportunities for capturing or holding industry leadership arise 


-  ,  For any organization ,  measuring and mapping the invisible pattern of competitive pressure among its rivals is the first step in creating order out of the confusion that is destroying the profitability of many highly competitive industries 


-  Because of frequent internal destabilizing actions and occasional external shocks ,  pressure systems can never be frozen 


-  Companies must seek superior position when possible and avoid intolerable pressure when necessary  but it is most valuable to gain superior strategic influence over the evolution of the system 


-  ,  The more two firms product or geographic markets overlap ,  the more pressure they exert on each other 


-  The pressure is proportional to the importance of markets to each firm and the degree of penetration by each firm 


-  This simple concept enables organizations to quantify the degree of pressure that one rival puts on another 


-  )  ,  When measuring and mapping competitive pressure ,  it is not easy to define ,  on an  priori basis ,  the boundaries of or key players in an industry 


-  It is best to do this empirically by beginning with all competitors whose markets overlap significantly with the focal firm  ( the one creating the map )  and then including firms that pressure those competitors 


-  The primary purpose of pressure mapping is not to illustrate the current use of competitive tactics  (  


-  ,  price ,  advertising or innovation wars )  but to provide insight about who has the potential and the incentive to make or avoid future use of pressure 


-  By casting the net wide ,  it is possible to find tacit allies and to identify potential acquisitions or opportunities to enter new markets that could shift the balance and direction of pressure applied to selected rivals 


-  The mapping is based on hard market share and revenue data that are often readily available in marketing ,  competitive intelligence or strategic planning groups 


-  It is often useful to locate the most focal firm or the most aggressive or targeted rival at the center of the map ,  or to place the industry leaders at the top of the map to minimize the number of intersecting arrows 


-  ,  Consider the airline industry as it existed in the early 1990s 


-  While the industry at that time appeared highly competitive to most observers ,  closer investigation reveals embedded patterns of pressure that mixed incentives to compete and cooperate 


-  )  ,  The map reflects that the industry leaders in the early 1990s were American ,  United and Delta  collectively known as the Big Three Supercarriers 


-  These three had deep pockets and large hub-and-spoke systems with economies of scale and wider connectivity than the other carriers 


-  Second-tier players were large national carriers that were not leaders for  variety of reasons 


-  Some were financially weakened by  combination of hostile unions and excessive post-deregulation growth or competition  ( Continental and Eastern )  


-  Two low-cost niche players had arisen after deregulation: America West and Southwest 


-  America West was built on  hub-and-spoke system ,  whereas Southwest focused on direct flights to secondary airports 


-  Local and regional players ,  like Aloha and Alaska Airlines ,  were engaged in  struggle for the same geographic markets 


-  And parts of the industry were suffering from aggressive ,  sporadic  ( some might even say almost continuous )  price wars in the late 1980s and early 1990s 


-  Fierce turf battles were being played out as competitors entered each others markets ,  resulting in numerous overlapping geographic markets that had not existed at the time of deregulation in the early 80s 


-  ,  When interpreting any pressure map ,  it is often helpful to start by looking at the current position and behavior of the industry leaders 


-  Is there one firm  ( or  dominant coalition of firms )  that seems to be applying  lot of pressure? Are the leaders aggressively applying pressure among themselves or just against lesser firms? Has  leader applied pressure that is so great it constitutes  major invasion or are the leaders avoiding contact by taking only minor positions in each others markets? Is the pressure exchanged between the leaders asymmetrical or balanced in intensity? Such questions naturally lead to others: Why are they acting as they do? Are there any explicit ,  implicit or even unconscious strategies unfolding? Who is central to the evolution of the system ,  driving the actions and position of others? ,  It is also useful to look for subsystems composed of smaller numbers of firms tightly organized in pairs or triangular relationships to see how their interdependence influences their behavior 


-  Triangles may involve formal alliances or multimarket contacts that create mutual forbearance between all or just two of the members 


-  The subset of firms may act as  united bloc ,  have  central player that influences the other two ,  or two members that share the third as  common rival 


-  Delta has taken large market share in markets important to Eastern ,  but Eastern has taken only minor positions in Deltas important markets ,  giving Delta the advantage 


-  Delta lacks incentive to forbear with respect to Easterns markets unless Eastern were to take some moderate footholds in Deltas most important markets  ( an opportunity that Eastern missed )  


-  In contrast ,  Delta and American each have moderate positions of about equal strength in the others markets 


-  These hostage markets are not big enough to create  struggle over identical turf ,  as between Southwest and America West ,  but just enough to restrain Delta and American from attacking each other aggressively 


-  ,  This type of mutual opposing and equally balanced pressure does not completely eliminate competition between two rivals ,  but has the potential to redirect it in two important ways 


-  Second ,  rigorous research in numerous highly competitive industries has shown that firms pressuring each other in this way often improve their profitability ,  avoid further expansion in the overlapping rivals markets ,  limit aggressive actions to the rivals least important markets ,  and focus on growth elsewhere 


-  Rivals may even give up share in their weak markets in exchange for greater share in their strong markets so they both gain economies of scale 


- 10 ,  Looking at the third leg of the triangle ,  the mutual forbearance between American and Delta also influences the American-Eastern relationship 


-  In fact ,  after Eastern ceased operations in 1991 ,  Delta benefited by picking up many of Easterns markets ,  giving it control of some safe haven airports 


-  ,  Examining the pressure map of the early 90s airline industry ,  one can see that several subsystems shaped how the industry consolidated and which carriers survived 


-  There were four principal dynamic forces at work: Two-directional pressure between American and Delta and between American and United created  triumvirate of mutual forbearance that freed each company to put pressure on the second-tier players without the threat of intervention by another supercarrier 


-  This further allowed each to focus its resources on one or two targeted carriers at most and enabled  downward pressure cascade ,  which tends to cause market consolidation 


-  American was in  central position in the pressure system and played the role of enforcer 


-  Whenever Delta and United acted against each other  ( because they lacked incentives for mutual forbearance )  ,  American was caught in the crossfire ,  forced to defend its interests and perhaps even to use disciplinary actions 


-  These included the use or the threat of temporary but punishing market entries and price-based retaliation to keep the rest of the Big Three focused on the second tier rather than on one another 


-  ,  Between 1990 and 1995 ,  as  result of these dynamic forces ,  Eastern ,  Pan Am and Braniff all but disappeared 


-  US Airways acquired its main competitor ,  Piedmont ,  but was never financially strong enough to make  play for  leadership position in the industry 


-  And Southwest won the low-cost niche ,  defeating America West and Midway 


-  ,  By 1995 ,  the original three-tier hierarchical pattern of pressure had consolidated into  stable power-sharing among the three supercarriers in which each dominated domestic hubs where the other two dared not expand ,  thereby improving profitability for each 


-  )  To perpetuate this favorable pressure system ,  they needed to stay out of each others most profitable turf and to refrain from placing further pressure on the remaining non-supercarriers to avoid antitrust issues 


-  The non-supercarriers moved into the domestic territories not occupied by the Big Three ,  avoided aggressive competition in the supercarriers hub cities ,  or established positions in the less-traveled foreign routes to Asia or Latin America 


-  The price wars of the early 90s disappeared ,  and industry profits shifted from  $13 


-  ,  Funded by  stable home front ,  the supercarriers shifted their attention to the transatlantic market through alliances with European carriers ,  eventually dividing the market about equally 


-  They launched their own Web sites and cooperated to create  joint Web site  ( Orbitz 


- com )  ,  selling airline tickets at  discount to put pressure on potential disrupters of the current pressure system ,  such as Priceline 


-  With roughly equal market share and deep pockets ,  the Big Three competed only indirectly through international growth and improved operational efficiency from greater volume funneled from overseas 


-  The pressure system remained more or less in equilibrium until the external shock caused by the events of September 11 destabilized it 


-  ,  In any industry ,  companies can develop competitive strategy by using  pressure map to answer two critical questions: If the current pressure pattern continues ,  what position will my firm ultimately hold? How can my firm stabilize or shift the direction of pressure to reduce  ( or enhance )  the predicted impact of the current pressure system? ,  Had the airline industrys second-tier carriers asked these questions ,  for instance ,  they could have countered the four principal dynamics that enabled the Big Three to control the downward flow of pressure 


-  For example ,  the second-tier players could have weakened Americans enforcer role by attacking it from all directions 


-  If American were besieged ,  the other super-carriers may have joined in the attack because an overwhelmed American could no longer enforce its threatened use of hostage markets 


-  While it may seem implausible that simultaneous attacks by small players could vanquish an industry leader ,  it happens frequently 


-  ,  Alternatively ,  some of the second-tier carriers could have consolidated and attacked the markets exchanged as hostages among two of the Big Three 


-  By combining as one major player ,  they could also have worked to establish their own mutual forbearance with some of the supercarriers 


-  As  third possibility ,  Eastern ,  which was once one of the largest airlines in the world ,  might have moved to undermine the triangle formed by American and Delta by reallocating its routes to create mutual forbearance with at least one of those players 


-  ,  Whether  company is the beneficiary or the victim of the pressure system in its industry ,  it can intervene to alter that system and gain strategic advantage through competitor and market selection ,  mergers and acquisitions or formal alliances ,  and other powerful strategic tools described below 


-  Depending on the situation ,  the goal may be either to stabilize the current system or to destabilize it and redirect the existing pressure patterns 


-  ,  In 19th-century Europe ,  royal families cooperated in what was known as  concert of powers to control disruptive nations while continuing to compete among themselves for colonies ,  economic power and influence 


-  In business ,  most industries have only  few leaders and they frequently exhibit  similar dynamic ,  as evidenced by the preceding airline industry example 


-  ,  Similar to the great power nations of world history ,  industry leaders generally prefer stable systems and employ five time-tested mechanisms to achieve that stability: checks and balances; tit for tat; shared power systems; polarized blocs; and collective security arrangements 


- 11 Over time ,  the use of these mechanisms signals each leaders tolerances and limitations to the others 


-  These mechanisms are used in sequence or in combination ,  depending upon the financial and strategic capability and will of an industrys leaders to carry them out 


-  ,  Industry leaders simultaneously use competitive pressure to hold ambitious competitors in check either by containing ,  constricting or undermining their growth and economic power 


-  Similarly ,  to support its Java programming language ,  Sun Microsystems organized an informal everybody-but-Microsoft alliance of software and hardware makers in the 90s to check the power of Microsofts ActiveX language 


-  ,  Individual leaders sequentially discipline potential rivals when they threaten the current pressure pattern ,  as American Airlines did when it acted as enforcer during the early 90s ,  using selective fare wars to keep the other supercarriers off its turf 


-  This pattern began at Texas airports during the 80s when American played tit for tat against Braniff and Texas Air ,  two Texas-based airlines whose strong growth strategies threatened to preempt Americans home base in the Dallas/Fort Worth hub 


-  ,  Leaders achieve  consensus that no major competitor will attempt to disrupt the pressure system ,  as the Big Three Supercarriers did in the late 1990s 


-  However ,  if one of the leaders gains too much power ,  it will be ostracized and lose its influence 


-  For example ,  Sony and Philips Electronics have evolved  power-sharing arrangement that has both tacit and explicit aspects 


-  Sony has traditionally focused on the United States and Asia ,  while Philips has dominance in Europe and Latin America 


-  The two share power over traditional Asian fast followers and component suppliers 


-  Recently ,  the two companies entered into an agreement to develop  joint operating system for digital consumer-electronic systems that will network home computers ,  television ,  video games ,  personal digital assistants ,  home appliances and audio equipment 


-  It remains to be seen if Philips recent troubles with high manufacturing costs and downsizing will make Philips  junior partner in the power-sharing arrangement 


-  It also remains to be seen if Matsushita will be invited to adopt the Sony-Philips standard ,  forgoing historic rivalries to fend off the computing hardware makers that are converging on the digital appliance and home server markets 


-  ,  These are modified shared-power systems 


-  When there are two or more leaders in an industry ,  they can enter into shared power arrangements in separate blocs of opposing alliances 


-  Unlike shared power systems ,   polarized bloc may include industry nonleaders 


-  Nonleaders that align with  bloc benefit from preferred relationships within the bloc ,  but can be ostracized if they refuse to take sides or prove disloyal 


-  Their blocs include other beverage makers that distribute or bottle using the blocs as alliance partners ,  suppliers ,  bottlers ,  consultants and advertising agencies 


-  This bloc system helped Coca-Cola and Pepsico contain Cadbury Schweppes attempt to form  new major player during the 1980s and 1990s 


-  ,  These stabilize relationships among industry leaders and among lesser firms by giving all players an incentive for peaceful coexistence 


-  Leaders in digital hardware  ( such as Nokia ,  IBM ,  Intel ,  Motorola ,  Toshiba and Lucent )  as well as hundreds of less powerful firms  ( such as Acer ,  AMD ,  and Delco )  have formed  collective security arrangement around Bluetooth ,   designer and manufacturer of chips that enable short-distance ,  digital wireless connections 


-  By spring 2000 ,  more than  , 800 companies had agreed to use Bluetooths technology 


-  The ostensible benefit for everyone is universal connectivity among all the devices that they make ,  but the other benefit is stability in the relationships among these players 


-  Even if Bluetooth does not survive as the supplier of choice ,  it is unlikely that any single ambitious player will be able to use  new digital wireless technology to disrupt the status quo 


-  ,  An organization that is not benefiting from an existing pressure system or will not benefit from that systems current path of evolution may want to destabilize it and redirect pressure among its rivals 


-  This requires two crucial strategic choices: selection of the appropriate allies and selection of the appropriate target (  )  


-  ,  Interventions in  pressure system ,  based on alliances and targeting ,  can be used to signal dissatisfaction with the position or moves of  rival 


-  They can also be used to entice ,  pin down or distract  competitor in certain markets 


-  They can mold the market selection strategy of  rival ,  establish the borders between the market domains of two firms ,  force another player to converge on or diverge from  position ,  or eliminate  player or the allies of others 


-  And targeting can create mutual forbearance or natural alliances between those with common rivals 


-  ,  Allies should be selected to establish at least one of five clear types of alliances  each with  different strategic intent 


-  Allies can be surrogate attackers that help  company conserve its own resources by putting pressure on  desired target 


-  They can be critical supporters that help the company apply pressure to  common rival or passive supporters that refrain from pressuring the company while it puts pressure on another firm 


-  In its early days ,  Microsoft used Apple and then Intel as strategic umbrellas ,  inhibiting IBM from squashing Microsoft before it became strong enough to stand on its own 


-  Once IBM realized that Microsoft was  threat ,  IBMs actions were inhibited by the potential reactions of the umbrella firms with which Microsoft had alliances 


-  These five types of alliances can be established informally by signaling through public announcements or by applying pressure to create mutual forbearance ,  or they can be created formally through joint ventures and long-term contracts 


-  ,  Desired alliance partners often ignore suitors overtures if they do not currently share interest in  common target or  common vision for the pressure systems future 


-  Public signals or formal offers of alliance must be preceded by competitive pressure to put teeth into the signal or offer 


-  Methods for realigning the willingness of others to ally  ( or accept common targets )  include the divide and conquer ,  balancer and assimilator strategies 


-  Coca-Cola did this when it severed Pepsicos 50-year Venezuelan distribution partnership with the Cisneros family by convincing the family to sign  more lucrative deal with Coke 


-  Pepsicos market share in its only real foothold in South America fell from 42% to zero overnight 


-  American Airlines also used  divide-and-conquer strategy when it forced the breakup of  US Airways-British Airways alliance upon making its own controversial alliance with British Airways for transatlantic travelers 


-  Resistance from government agencies in the United States and Europe ultimately gutted the power of the American-British Airways alliance ,  but American kept the alliance ,  perhaps to block British Airways from forming an alliance with one of the other Big Three 


-  ,   balancer throws its weight back and forth between rivals ,  enabling it  ( or the firm that encouraged it to get into the balancing act )  to influence the rivals positioning and movement 


-  Winning the contract depends upon the support of radar and avionics suppliers  (  


-  Their influence is considerable because contract awards are typically all or nothing 


-  Assimilation can be accomplished through merger and acquisition or through exclusive supply or distribution contracts 


-  Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy saw this as an assimilation strategy to squeeze his company ,  since Suns biggest business at the time was selling Suns Solaris Unix operating systems to communications companies ,  its largest customer segment 


-   company may want to take on its biggest threat ,  the weakest of the major players ,   rising or aggressive player ,  or  competitor that doesnt pressure it directly but represents an attractive market 


-  The choice usually depends on the targeting firms goal for the pressure systems future pattern ,  the feasibility of the action and the opportunities that present themselves 


-  Despite coming late to the market ,  by 2001 AOL had attained the number three position in  fragmented market with three other leaders: number one T-Online  ( based in Germany )  ,  number two Tiscali  ( Italy )  and number four Wanadoo  ( France )  


-  T-Online ,   Deutsche Telekom  ( DT )  subsidiary ,  is by far the largest European ISP and holds the leadership position in its home market because its service is provided ,  by default ,  to DT subscribers 


-  million users 


-  Growing-but-weak Tiscali has made numerous small acquisitions in 15 countries ,  but it holds only the number three or four position and has low brand recognition in most of them 


-  In its home market ,  it holds only the fifth spot 


-  Wanadoo has  strong position in its home market ,  as well as  strong position in the United Kingdom because of its acquisition of Freeserve ,  the countrys top ISP 


-  ,  In this case ,  AOL had several options: Attack or acquire into the leaders  ( T-Onlines )  home market; target markets not important to T-Online; go after the home market of the most vulnerable player  ( Tiscali )  or target no one and grow diffusely across Europe 


-  AOL is exerting significant effort in Germany ,  packaging its content to keep its users online  


-  to  times longer  ( by different estimates )  than T-Online users ,  suing DT over its allegedly favorable telephone rates for T-Online users in Germany and using massive ad campaigns to capture German users 


-  Because T-Online lacks any counter-pressure through  foothold in AOLs home ISP market  ( the United States )  ,  AOL has not been constrained from its aggressive efforts 


-  ,  Most industry leaders prefer to fight small battles rather than large ,  risky ones ,  so they target the most vulnerable player 


-  It is often better for  company to redirect pressure away from itself or to weaken several players simultaneously than to eliminate the weakest player ,  because the latter scenario leaves major competitors capable of exerting  lot of pressure 


-  Not targeting the weakest player may leave more rivals on the field ,  but each with reduced focus and power 


-  ,  Consider General Motors position in the automobile industry 


-  Its home market is the United States ,  but it has  strong foothold in Europe  ( its Opel division )  


-  GM could target the weakest global player ,  DaimlerChrysler ,  which is in financial difficulty ,  but it would still face two powerful competitors  ( Ford and Toyota )  


-  Or it could target the strongest competitor on each continent: Ford in the  


-  But in the unlikely event that GM succeeds ,  it would become the undisputed global leader ,  facing three weakened competitors 


-  ,  The at-a-glance information in  pressure map can be greatly enhanced in  number of ways 


-  Safe havens  ( relatively uncontested markets )  ,  formal alliances and an industrys stabilizing mechanisms can be shown graphically 


-  Interior circles can be included that are proportional to the size of  company in the markets being considered or in its home geographic or key product market 


-  The arrows can be color-coded to reflect relative advantage in price ,  advertising ,  innovation quality or service 


-  Dotted arrows can be added to indicate the migration of the players to markets outside of the industry ,  with the size of the dotted arrow representing the magnitude of resources being devoted to the move 


-  ,  An enhanced pressure map can concisely present  considerable amount of information about the balance of power in an industry 


-  Look ,  for example ,  at the industry landscape that was created when  


- -based Vodafone acquired Germanys Mannesmann in June 2000 ,  forming  pan-European giant with $24 billion in revenues and 34 million customers  in an industry that had previously been operated by nationally dominant state-owned or -regulated firms 


-  )  ,  In 2002 ,  Vodafone is the undisputed industry leader with lower subscriber acquisition costs and greater economies of scale and connectivity than its competitors 


-  It has strong ,  positive free cash flow and holds strong positions  approximately one-third of the home market  against each of the national wireless leaders in Germany  ( DT )  ,  Italy  ( Telecom Italia )  and Spain  ( Telefonica )  


-  Its partnership with Vivendi ,  SBC Communications and British Telecom ,  called SFR ,  holds  third of the French market against France Telecoms Orange A/S 


-  ,  The enhanced pressure map of the wireless industry helps make sense of  seemingly simple situation that has triggered complex maneuvers with sometimes-obscure rationales 


-  On the surface ,  the map indicates clearly that ,  in 2001 ,  players such as British Telecom ,  France Telecoms Orange A/S and DT were on the defensive and had to counter Vodafone if they wished to avoid becoming second-tier players 


-  The simple solution  an assimilation strategy  would have been to merge their mobile operations ,  attract several smaller players and form another pan-European mobile telecom ,   powerful counter-balancing rival to Vodafone ,  thereby creating two polarized blocs in the European wireless industry 


-  But this strategy would have been politically impossible ,  given the current nationalistic regulation of European telephone companies 


-  ,  Analysis of the map also suggests that the players could check and balance Vodafone in more complex ,  but still effective ,  ways 


-  That seems to have been the chosen strategy ,  and ,  in 2002 ,  Vodafone has begun to feel the counter-pressure 


-  In Germany ,  Vodafone faces  strong defensive counterattack from DT 


-  Vodafone lost 400 , 000 subscribers in that country in the first quarter of 2002 alone 


-  market ,  Vodafone is in  tight market-share race with British Telecoms Cellnet  ( rebranded mmO2 )  ,  France Telecoms Orange A/S ,  and DT-owned One2One  ( rebranded T-Mobile )  


-  Given its active defense in Germany ,  DT is aggressively attacking and taking market share in the United Kingdom ,  unfettered by fear of Vodafone retaliating in the German market 


-  France Telecoms Orange A/S is even more aggressive ,  attacking Vodafone in the United Kingdom ,  unconstrained by fear of counterattack in its home market where it holds 43% market share 


-  ,  Vodafone appears to be trying to hold its market share position against British Telecom and France Telecoms Orange A/S in the  


-  Meanwhile ,  Vodafones strategy seems to include attacking Telecom Italia  its financially strongest opponent but lacking the multimarket contact to counterattack elsewhere  and Telefonica ,  which has demonstrated  lack of commitment to Europe by migrating excessively  ( dotted arrow )  to Latin America 


-  ,  The SFR alliance ,  originally conceived as  counterbalancing move against France Telecom by two British firms  ( Vodafone and British Telecom )  ,  is troubled by the conflicting interests of its partners ,  including an intense rivalry between Vodafone and British Telecom in their home market and Vivendis redeployment of resources to the entertainment industry 


-  Vodafone was reported to be interested in buying out Vivendis stake13  perhaps to make SFR an aggressive counterbalance against Orange A/S in France once again  and British Telecom has indicated its willingness to sell out as well 


-  ,  In addition ,  Vodafone is reportedly considering exiting its joint venture with Verizon in the  


-  wireless market to bring cash home to support its European initiative 


-  This may be necessary because of the rising counterpressure from rivals ,  the fear of  consolidation of several rivals if political conditions were to permit ,  and the need for funds  ( for initiatives such as  


-  ,  The European wireless industry illustrates how an enhanced pressure map can enable what if  exercises and contingency planning ,  allowing all players to anticipate with greater accuracy the outcomes of their own or others potential strategies 


-  In fact ,  if Vodafones competitors had used pressure mapping to do what-if analyses ,  it might have stimulated  more aggressive preemptive assimilation or alliance strategy among them before Vodafone acquired Mannesmann 


-  But ,  by using competitive pressure maps and  systems approach to understanding the dynamic patterns underlying multimarket contacts within an industry ,  competitors can make  good plan for making contact with enemies and allies alike 


-  ,  Systems of mixed cooperation ,  competition and forbearance exist in every industry and are not necessarily anticompetitive ,  collusive oligopolies 


-  In fact ,  if used properly ,  pressure mapping can actually reduce the temptation to collude ,  drive industry growth to new heights and in new directions through increased indirect competition ,  and make room for clever small players that act as balancers or members of polarized blocs and collective security agreements 


-  In the end ,  use of pressure and mutual forbearance must be responsible and tailored to avoid violation of antitrust and any other relevant national laws 


-  As with any strategy ,  companies should use their ability to change the pressure situation in their industries for the greater good of shareholders ,  customers and society as  whole 


-  ,  Although the general logic and strategy of pressure systems will apply to  wide variety of situations involving geographic and product markets ,  there are industries in which pressure patterns are obvious and maps may not be revealing 


-  Still ,  evidence of significant profit impact from pressure based on multimarket contacts has been found for industries as diverse as banking , 14 cement , 15 hotels , 16 knitwear manufacturing , 17 mobile telephone service18 and petroleum19  on both the global and local levels 


-  ,  Of course ,  competitive pressure is not the only force that affects profitability and survival 


-  Major discontinuities ,  such as terrorism or technological revolution ,  can destroy even the most stabilized systems 


-  And firms can implode from labor problems ,  poor management and implementation errors that shift the balance of power among the players to stronger players outside the current leadership 


-  ,  The changing nature of industries and the external forces that affect them suggest that pressure systems require constant reexamination 


-  Indeed ,  if several maps done at periodic intervals are viewed electronically in rapid sequence ,  like an animated film ,  an industry can be seen evolving ,  providing  powerful and visceral understanding of how the world is moving and how the pressure is flowing 


- Talk to the senior executives of any progressive company today and they will tell you about its huge investments in innovation ,  bulging new-product pipelines ,  proprietary technologies and relentless drive to shrink time to market 


-  Theyll also admit that these efforts have not helped them outrun the competition 


-  Although businesses are moving faster than ever ,  competitors are constantly nipping at their heels ,  emulating new products ,  replicating entire product-development systems and processes ,  and keeping pace on the same treadmill 


-  New products may generate hefty returns ,  but the advantage is short-lived 


-  ,  Eroding competitive leads are the result of forces that are equalizing companies ability to innovate: the increasingly rapid and free flow of information and knowledge ,  the movement to global standards and the advent of open markets for components and technologies 


-  Thanks to open markets and open standards ,  Handspring has access to the same product designers and manufacturers that Palm uses 


-  ,  This example is not the exception ,  and it raises profound questions about the sources of sustainable competitive advantage 


-  If product parity is relatively easily achieved in todays world ,  customers will turn to new criteria when deciding to buy one companys products over anothers 


-  In particular ,  we have focused on this question: Why do your customers choose to buy from you rather than from your competition?  ( See About the Research 


-  They agreed almost universally that offering great products ,  technologies or services is merely an entry stake into the competitive arena 


-  Most spoke of the need to maintain an edge in the way their companies interact with customers; that is ,  they recognized that customers often value how they interact with their suppliers as much as or more than what they actually buy 


-  As the main drivers of customer choice ,  the executives cited cost-oriented factors like convenience ,  ease of doing business and product support ,  as well as risk-oriented factors like trust ,  confidence and the strength of relationships 


-  ,  Although many managers realize the need to pay attention to cost and risk factors that influence customer choice ,  our research data indicate that companies are usually at  loss when it comes to translating this conceptual understanding into practice 


-  We did find counterexamples ,  however: companies that are using one of five strategies to build competitive advantage through their approach to customers 


-  Before we turn to the strategies ,  well take  closer look at how perceptions of cost and risk affect customers 


-  ,  When product improvements can be matched quickly by competitors ,  companies have only two remaining levers available to influence purchase decisions: They can reduce customers interaction costs or make the purchase and subsequent product ownership  less risky proposition 


-  ,  Start with the issue of lowering costs 


-   buyer incurs  variety of costs in the course of learning about  sellers products and services ,  acquiring them ,  using them and finally disposing of them 


-  In addition ,  to extract value from the product ,  the buyer must configure the product to his or her needs 


-  That can be as simple as chilling  beer before drinking it and as complex as integrating  new organizationwide software system with the existing IT infrastructure 


-  Finally ,  when  customer buys  product or service ,  he or she commits to  rigid seller-defined bundle and forgoes the benefits of other potential bundles available in the marketplace 


-  For example ,  when someone buys  family minivan ,  he or she obtains roominess and comfort but can never ,  with that product ,  enjoy the psychological benefits that come from driving  convertible 


-  Most companies never attend to such costs ,  but they are real 


-  Managers who give thought to ways to reduce these interaction costs will likely uncover innovative ways of increasing customers gain 


-  ,  In addition to the generally hidden costs that customers face when they try to decide on  supplier ,  buyers also take on considerable risk and uncertainty 


-  Can  trust the sellers promises? Will the product perform as expected? Will  be able to implement it successfully? Will  lose money? Will the seller be around for repair and maintenance? When potential customers feel that the risk is high that their expectations will not be met ,  they quite naturally choose not to buy 


-  Many companies have been in situations in which customers stick with the industry leaders product even though their new product is either of superior quality or cheaper or both  in their calculus of risk ,  customers prefer to wait until the new offering has been clearly recognized as superior for some time before they make  switch 


-  Of course ,  the buyer can engage in due diligence to address questions of risk ,  but due diligence costs time ,  effort and money  in other words ,  it raises the interaction costs 


-  Theyve reconsidered exactly what it is they are selling ,  theyve leveraged strengths to make customers lives easier ,  theyve worked with other organizations to provide an optimal  ( and unique )  bundle of products and so on 


-   review of the strategies theyve followed can provide managers in almost any industry with new ways of thinking about building advantage with customers 


-  ,  All companies recognize the power of economies of scale ,  scope and experience in producing better or cheaper products 


-  Consider that suppliers often have many interactions of the same type with different customers  ( scale )  ,  many interactions with the same customer  ( scope )  ,  and access to information that makes it easier for them to gauge the risks involved in an activity for  particular customer  ( experience )  


-  To increase their customers sense of expected gain from  transaction ,  companies can reconfigure their activities to lower buyers interaction costs and perceived risk 


-  For example ,   supplier may be able to identify tasks that its customers have in common and decide that it can perform them more cheaply or effectively 


-  By taking responsibility for the tasks ,  suppliers can save their customers time and money and effectively lock them in 


-  ,  Consider Master Builders recent launch of its MasterTrac system 


-  Master Builders sells chemical admixtures that are used to improve the performance characteristics of concrete; its customers include concrete producers that have many locations and either  regional or national presence 


-  Until the new system was put in place ,  managers at each of the producers locations independently ordered and maintained inventory of each type of additive to suit their local requirements 


-  The small shipments were not cost effective ,  and emergency shipments were often necessary when customers failed to anticipate their needs correctly 


-  ,  To meet this challenge ,  Master Builders developed  remote tank-monitoring system for immediate and seamless inventory control 


-  The MasterTrac system consists of additive storage tanks fitted with wireless sensors that ,  when queried ,  relay inventory information to  Web site accessible to both Master Builders and the customer 


-  Under the new system ,  the customer realizes major savings from reduced inventory financing ,  reduced order and payment processing ,  and reduced inventory management time 


-  Competitors that seek to win over the customer now face  much harder task 


-  ,  Suppliers may also gain  sustainable advantage by reducing their customers risk ,  especially if they leverage their experience and reach 


-  Asea Brown Boveri found  way to do that in its tubular products business 


-  Although the product requires some technological know-how to manufacture ,  it is basically  pipe with threading welded onto it 


-  In 1999 ,  ABB was the world leader in this market but was facing increased competition from low-cost welding shops 


-  ,  Since oil rigs can be located anywhere in the world  ( from Siberia to Vietnam to Chile )  ,  the industry convention was to price the product at the factory gate 


-  Drilling companies would then take ownership and arrange to have the product delivered to the rigs 


-  Their headaches began at this point since delays in getting the pipe to the drilling site were very expensive: Rental prices for an ocean-going drilling rig are $150 , 000 per day 


-  Although the threat of delays was not ABBs problem per se ,  the company recognized an opportunity to shift the terms of the business away from cost 


-  ABB was uniquely positioned to take on that task for its customers 


-  Because of its many business units in various industries ,  the company had  well-established presence in more than 100 countries ,  and its oil and gas unit understood the import regulations worldwide for the drilling business 


-  Even though ABB charged for these deliveries at cost ,  the increased value to the customer in terms of lower risk was much more significant 


-  ,  Over time ,  ABBs position as the market leader solidified because competitors lacked the global reach and expertise required to offer contracts that guaranteed delivery 


-  ABB succeeded by looking at its interaction pattern with customers in all its businesses and finding an area where its risk was lower than that of its customers and competitors 


-  ABBs product hasnt changed ,  but the new way of offering it has increased its customers expected gain from their purchases 


-  ,  Its  given that companies must offer high-quality products if they want to succeed 


-  Its also  given that the products themselves ,  even when theyre very good ,  rarely provide all the benefits that customers are looking for 


-  The trick for companies is to redefine their offerings in ways that make it easy for customers to get the benefits they seek 


-  ,  The Australian division of ICI Explosives took an innovative approach to helping its customers reap the benefits of one of the most unglamorous products imaginable: pieces of rock 


-  ICI ,  like its competitors ,  had long sold commodity explosives to quarries 


-  The quarries used these explosives to blast solid rock into aggregates of equal size 


-  The customers challenge is to turn the rock face into  product that can be sold; an ineffective blast will yield large chunks of rock that are much harder to break down 


-  As such ,  designing  successful blast requires considerable expertise and has  major effect on profitability 


-  As many as 20 parameters affect the performance of the blast ,  including the profile of the rock face ,  the depth and diameter of the drill holes ,  and the weather 


-  ICI ,  recognizing the risk that customers face ,  began  program to quantify what had previously been considered an art 


-  Using computer models and experimentation ,  ICI engineers developed strategies and procedures that narrowed the uncertainty of blast performance 


-  Instead of selling this new expertise as an added service ,  however ,  ICI began performing the blasts for the quarries and writing contracts for broken rock 


-  ,  The new contracts significantly reduce the business costs and risk faced by customers in two ways 


-  First ,  they turn fixed costs  ( primarily quarry employees and drilling equipment )  into variable ones and second ,  they set the performance of  blast at an acceptable minimum level 


-  ICI is no longer simply  supplier of commodity explosives; it has become an integral part of its customers business 


-  ,  To create value beyond products ,  companies have to recognize that tangible goods are what they are: rigid ,  inflexible packages that impose an opportunity cost  the cost of forgoing alternatives  on the customer 


-  Premier Auto Group ,  the luxury arm of Ford that manages brands such as Jaguar ,  Land Rover and Volvo ,  understands that its product offering may be too much of  constraint for its customers 


-  Customers will not purchase  car but rather  mobility contract from PAG that will allow them to use  sedan ,   limousine ,   sport utility vehicle or  convertible ,  depending on the customers needs 


-  ,  Companies can systematically configure offerings that create value by simplifying the route to the benefits that customers seek 


-  And suppliers can find  new source of competitive advantage if they can better perform certain tasks or better absorb related risks or costs than their customers can ,  all while producing the same benefits 


-  Companies can avoid the need to be wholly responsible by taking  collaborative approach  that is ,  by integrating various activities with their customers as  means of lowering risk and costs 


-  ,   division of Magna International has integrated its activities with one of its major customers ,  DaimlerChrysler ,  to help the automobile giant meet its production needs 


-  Magna International is one of the worlds largest and most diversified automobile parts suppliers; it has 166 manufacturing divisions and 31 product-development and engineering centers in 18 countries 


-  Radical changes in the automotive industry ,  however ,  have forced the company to change as well 


-  Product and model life cycles have been drastically reduced; consumers are more fickle than ever; and competitors are aggressive in their pursuit of market share 


-  Not surprisingly ,  demand for any given model of car is notoriously difficult to forecast ,  and automobile manufacturers need to be agile enough to respond rapidly to changes in the market 


-  ,  To help manufacturers attain such operational flexibility ,  Magna International created Magna Steyr 


-  This division is not merely an arms length parts supplier 


-   few years ago ,  Magna Steyr was able to solve DaimlerChryslers enviable problem of excess demand for the Mercedes-Benz M-class sport utility vehicle 


-  Magna Steyr had already been involved with DaimlerChrysler in the production of E-class Mercedes sedans and the Jeep Grand Cherokee and was accustomed to working closely with DaimlerChrysler engineers and regularly receiving information on demand forecasts 


-  So when at the end of 1998 worldwide demand for the M-class SUV outstripped total capacity at DaimlerChryslers plant in Tuscaloosa ,  Alabama ,  Magna Steyr was called in to provide backup 


-  Magna Steyrs integration with DaimlerChrysler was so seamless that the company might be confused for  division of DaimlerChrysler 


-  AXIS specializes in the production of machinery for the manufacture of electric motors used in the automotive ,  domestic appliance ,  and power tool industries ,  and it has  reputation for quality and technical expertise 


-  But in  mature and competitive industry ,  those strengths were proving insufficient 


-  Customers like Black  Decker and Philips were increasingly concerned with their ability to reduce time to market and meet peak-season demand and were ,  as  result ,  turning  critical eye on their suppliers 


-  ,  After AXISs managers had made that decision ,   power tool manufacturer contracted with the company to supply  new production line for  nonstandard electric motor needed to make  new product 


-  Space was limited and labor costs were  concern ,  so the line had to be relatively compact and highly automated 


-  Using  Web-based three-dimensional CAD system ,  AXIS worked with the customers engineers to optimize design concepts and help the customer create performance metrics under different operating circumstances and configurations 


-  After the basic concept was agreed on ,  AXIS engineers designed the production line ,  sharing drawings ,  specifications and other data in real time with the customers engineers 


-  An improvement on that order normally would have been integrated into the next version of the product ,  but now it could be built into the original design 


-  ,  Once the production machinery design was completed and approved ,  the documents were sent to the production team and stored online in  folder open to everyone involved in the project 


-  Later ,  as the production team began work on building the line ,  they realized that the engineers had been optimistic about the amount of work needed to construct one of the peripheral machines 


-  To prevent triggering  slippage notice ,  they informed the designers in both organizations and referred them to drawings produced for an earlier project that might prove to be an adequate fix 


-  Production delays were minimized ,  and the customer was able to get the product to market on schedule 


-  Documents from the production phase were also stored online and made accessible to in-field maintenance people in both companies 


-  ,  The sharing of information and business-process integration at every step of the way were major factors in the customers successful launch of the new product 


-  The customer enjoyed unprecedented control over the design and creation of the new production line and is likely to return to AXIS for related needs in the future 


-  ,   trusted supplier can turn itself into  market maker for many products and services that it doesnt actually produce  and make money in the process 


-  By being the link between customers and the sellers of complementary products and services ,  the supplier reduces buyers search and acquisition costs by certifying only qualified contacts 


-  At the same time ,  the supplier increases the number of customer touch points and thus its claims on customer loyalty 


-  ,  NTT DoCoMo is the nexus for many suppliers and customers that produce and use mobile Internet products and services 


-  The foundation for i-modes success is DoCoMos coordination of all aspects of the mobile Internet experience: hardware ,  access ,  services and billing 


-  Such coordination lowers interaction costs and risks for customers by making it easy to use the service while guaranteeing consistency 


-  ,  In terms of hardware ,  for example ,  DoCoMo has worked closely with suppliers like Sony ,  Panasonic and Fujitsu to standardize i-mode handsets 


-  The company has simplified access and use by building the service around  single portal that is available only through i-mode-enabled phones and by making it easy to navigate through  , 600 DoCoMo-certified sites from the portal 


-  Web sites are keen to be endorsed by DoCoMo and are willing to adapt their offerings to DoCoMo standards for the privilege of being able to reach millions of users  who ,  in turn ,  get instant access to  critical mass of content and services 


-  Subscribers receive  single ,  itemized monthly bill ,  and because they get only one invoice from  trusted source ,  they are more apt to try new services than they would be through fixed-line Internet connections ,  where payment and verification are required for each site independently 


-  By earning the trust needed to occupy the center of the mobile Internet ,  DoCoMo is offering value to hardware suppliers ,  content providers and millions of i-mode users 


-  Intuits QuickBooks has an 85% share of the small-business-accounting software market and  98% customer loyalty rating 


-  But the more interesting story is how Intuit has been able to capitalize on its success with QuickBooks to capture an ever bigger share of small-business expenditures on information and data handling 


-  Services such as QuickBooks Site Solutions  ( an Internet tool that enables small businesses to create  professional Internet presence )  and QuickBooks Online Payroll have deepened its interaction with customers while reducing their risk and cost 


-  ,  More recently ,  Intuit has opened up access to the application-programming interfaces for the QuickBooks products 


-  Third-party developers are now able to create software applications that are integrated into the QuickBooks platform 


-  Intuits move significantly reduces the small businesss cost of obtaining these solutions ,  since integration with its own internal procedures is guaranteed 


-  The QuickBooks seal of approval also reduces the customers risk incurred in the selection of  new supplier or software 


-  By allowing third-party developers to trade on its platform of trust ,  Intuit has placed itself at the nexus of suppliers and buyers in the industry 


-  ,  Companies often have to collaborate with other organizations to help form the future  in other words ,  to shape businesses and products that will change the way commerce happens 


-  This is especially true for new technologies in the networked economy ,  which are rarely the product of  single company 


-  And what any business today has to realize is that the customers sense of risk is nowhere greater than when it is contemplating large cap-for any company developing  new technology ,  then ,  is to seek ways to lower the risks and costs from the early stages of product development onward  that is ,  even before  polished product is ready for  mass audience 


-  Sometimes ,  as the story of SAMSys Technologies indicates ,  that even means giving up on your core product 


-  The technology works like this: Objects are tagged with semiconductors that emit radio frequencies and can then communicate with one another and with people 


-  The range of potential applications is staggering  for example ,  RFID could be used to inventory entire warehouses at the touch of  button or to get information about the contents of transport trucks and containers without opening them 


-   recent Accenture study found that RFID technology could save $70 billion in the supply chain by reducing inefficiencies in inventory carrying costs ,  shrinkage and labor 


-  The hesitation has been caused by the lack of universal frequency and protocol standards ,  as well as the rapid evolution of tag technology 


-  ,  SAMSys was an early entrant in the RFID industry ,  and by 1998 it had developed  complete solution of tags and reader hardware 


-  When the company realized that RFID adoption was slow relative to its potential ,  it moved to boost sales in the industry as  whole rather than focus on promoting its own solution 


-  It recognized that customers would value  tag reader that was agnostic in terms of frequency and protocol so that they could invest in any RFID system without fear of incompatibility 


-  SAMSys decided to develop such  reader ,  but it knew that to succeed it needed to convince large players of its vision: tag suppliers ,  package makers and RFID system users 


-  ,  To influence tag suppliers like Texas Instruments ,  Philips and Motorola ,  SAMSys had to position itself as  complementor rather than  competitor 


-  Even though the large tag suppliers had their own ,  proprietary line of readers ,  they saw the SAMSys vision of universal readers as  way of decoupling their tag and reader product lines and significantly growing the tag business 


-  Texas Instruments and Philips are now SAMSyss alliance partners rather than its competitors 


-  ,  SAMSys next focused on the package suppliers  the companies that make the packages that house the RFID tags 


-  Over  period of several months ,  SAMSys persuaded International Paper ,  one of the largest packaging companies in the world ,  to enter into  strategic alliance 


-  International Paper now sees SAMSyss RFID solution as  way to add value to its paper-packaging products 


-  ,  Finally ,  SAMSys ,  in collaboration with its partners ,  developed  series of pilot projects to demonstrate the power of its standard-free RFID vision 


-  SAMSys has created multiproto-col readers that can be configured to fit each project 


-  ,  As products from competing companies become increasingly similar ,  differences in the way rivals interact with their customers are becoming more and more important 


-  Theres no doubt in our minds that strategies built around reducing customers interaction costs and risk are central to these differences; they offer  systematic way to tap into new sources of customer value 


-  Make no mistake: It is easy to underestimate the difficulties involved in shifting  companys focus from products to customer interactions 


-  Tactical marketing responses cant get the job done because they do the opposite of what is needed ,  adding to interactions rather than streamlining them 


-  But the tremendous untapped opportunities for creating value and establishing long-term advantage should ,  we believe ,  be enough to convince any senior executive of the superiority of  mind-set that starts with customers rather than products 


-  The great majority of them ,  however ,  are adept at producing only sustaining innovations  products or services that meet the demands of existing customers in established markets 


-  Few companies have introduced genuinely disruptive innovations ,  the kind that result in the creation of entirely new markets and business models 


-  And yet the motivation to pursue such innovations should be urgent 


-  In almost any industry you care to examine ,  the most dramatic stories of growth and success were launched from  platform of disruptive innovation 


-  ,  Most managers understand that significant ,  new ,  sustainable growth comes from creating new markets and ways of competing 


-  Why? Because when times are good and core businesses are growing robustly ,  starting new generations of growth ventures seems unnecessary; when times are bad and mature businesses are under attack ,  investments to create new growth businesses cant send enough profit to the bottom line quickly enough to satisfy investor pressure for  fast turnaround 


-  Our research indicates that if senior managers pursue this path  and if the growth businesses they start or acquire are truly disruptive  companies will find it less difficult and risky than many have supposed to create wave after wave of new growth 


-  ( To have  truer sense of whether  disruptive strategy may work in the future ,  its at least as important to understand what hasnt worked as what has 


-  As  result ,  we have devised two sets of litmus tests that senior managers can use to shape business plans to improve their chances of success 


-  Our research suggests that any proposal must pass at least one set of tests if project investments are to have  chance of paying off 


-  We conclude by outlining the process any company will need to institute if it wants to create an engine capable of building new disruptive businesses over and over again 


-  Although the task is far from simple ,  it can be done 


-  ,  The dichotomy between sustaining and disruptive innovations has been discussed in various contexts since Clayton Christensen first wrote about it in 1993 


-  For the purposes of this article ,  its important to bear in mind the following essential elements of the theory: ,  All ideas for new products and businesses emerge from innovators minds only partially formed 


-  They typically hesitate to throw their weight behind new product concepts whose market is not assured ,  fearing that their reputation for good judgment may be compromised 


-  As  consequence ,  the normal corporate process for shaping and funding ideas turns them into sustaining innovations that target large ,  obvious markets 


-  ,  Many of the ideas that end up as sustaining innovations could just as readily have been shaped into disruptive business plans ,  given  distinctly different process and managers who understood how to use it 


-  The first requires the creation of  new market that can serve as  base for disruption; the second is based on disruption of the prevailing business model from the low end 


-  ,  Companies seeking to create disruptive growth should first search for ways to compete against nonconsumption: peoples inability to use available products or services because they are too expensive or too complicated 


-  Its much easier to target potential customers who arent buying at all than to steal customers from an entrenched competitor 


-  Strategies that disrupt by creating new market applications for entirely new customers should meet the following three litmus tests 


-  ,  Test #1: Does the innovation target customers who in the past havent been able to do it themselves for lack of money or skills? ,  Many of the most successful disruptive growth businesses have given people direct access to products or services that had been too expensive or too complex for the mainstream 


-  For example ,  until the late 1970s computer jobs had to be processed by specialists in the corporate mainframe-computer center 


-  Today ,  ordinary people with PCs can handle problems that are far more complex than the ones mainframes used to solve 


-  Disruption pulled new users into the computer market by the millions ,  as the PC allowed people to compute conveniently for themselves 


-  The innovation may succeed in satisfying some customers ,  but it wont create significant new growth 


-  There just isnt  large population of nonconsumers who can be pulled into the market for bank accounts by Internet banking 


-  Because it cant meet this litmus test ,  online banking can be only  sustaining innovation that helps retail banks serve  segment of their existing customer base  bit more profitably and effectively 


-  New entrants are unlikely to be able to use the technology to disrupt established banks  ( unless they can conceive  strategy that passes the second set of litmus tests )  


-  ,  In contrast ,  online retail stock brokers such as E*Trade and Charles Schwab did have the potential to create  new disruptive growth market because they could enable  new set of customers  day traders  to speculate; in addition ,  they made trading so simple and inexpensive that people of relatively low net worth could begin to manage their own portfolios without the help of professionals 


-  Because these companies were initially competing against nonconsumption rather than Merrill Lynch ,  they could create  new wave of disruptive growth 


-  ,  Test #2: Is the innovation aimed at customers who will welcome  simple product? ,  If the innovation enables  new population of customers to consume for themselves ,  it can more easily be shaped to pass the second litmus test: The disruptive product must be technologically straightforward ,  targeted at customers who will be happy with  simple product 


-  Because corporate funding processes compel disruptive innovators to quantify the magnitude and certitude of the opportunity ,  potential disruptions are force-fit into obvious ,  measurable ,  existing market applications 


-  That leads corporate managers to hope for growth from improbable sources; more seriously ,  it pits innovators disruptive technology against  sustaining technology already in use by entrenched competitors 


-  The disruptive products performance must then surpass technologies on the sustaining trajectory ,  which is equivalent to killing off the product 


-  Cramming disruptions into established markets is very expensive and always fails 


-  ,  Successful disruptive innovators always target customers who welcome simple products 


-  Apple marketed its Apple II as  toy for children ,  while Xerox was misguidedly determined to use the same technology to automate the office 


-  Palms Pilot was  simple organizer ,  whereas Apple  ( having become the industry incumbent )  positioned its Newton as  handheld computer 


-  Today ,  NTT DoCoMo and its Japanese competitors have signed up 40 million profitable subscribers for their wireless Internet-access systems by making it easy for teenagers to download ring tones and wallpaper and by providing simple games to help young commuters kill time 


-  Their European and American counterparts ,  in contrast ,  are struggling to provide the bandwidth and screen size that will enable existing customers to do the same things on  phone that they do today on  computer; and because wireless access isnt as good as wireline access for these applications ,  they have no profitable customers 


-  Similarly ,  voice recognition technology is taking off in applications involving simple phrases ,  but IBMs ViaVoice product is designed to replace keyboard word processing and leaves users deeply dissatisfied 


-  ,  It is important to note that in each of those cases ,  the targeted application ,  product and customer set were not foreordained by the technology 


-  The divergent targets resulted from differences in the idea-shaping processes used by established companies and new entrants 


-  ,  Test #3: Will the innovation help customers do more easily and effectively what they are already trying to do? ,  This test requires innovators to keep in mind one essential fact: At  fundamental level ,  the things that people want to accomplish in their lives dont change quickly 


-  Because of this stability ,  if an idea for  new growth business is predicated on customers wanting to do something that hadnt been  priority in the past ,  it stands little chance of success 


-  ,  Lets illustrate this test by exploring the potential for digital imaging to disrupt the market for photographic film 


-  How do most people use photographic film? When theyve finished shooting  roll ,  they drop off the film at the developers ,  frequently ordering double prints so that copies of the best shots will be readily available to send to friends or relatives 


-  When the prints are ready ,  people bring them home ,  flip through them ,  put them back into the envelope ,  and put the envelope into  box or drawer 


-  ,  The digital-imaging companies approached amateur photographers with interesting propositions: If youll just take the time to learn how to use this software ,  you can edit out the red-eye in all those flash pictures and You can now keep all your pictures neatly arranged in online photo albums 


-  Digital camera users do send more images to more people over the Internet  the new technology lets people do more easily what they were trying to do in ordering double prints from film 


-  And the recipients of the images typically view them once ,  close the box and put the pictures into an envelope on the hard drive 


-  ,  Despite its disruptive potential ,  digital imaging hasnt created the major wave of new growth that digital film and camera companies so desperately need 


-  Theyve concentrated on making products that can deliver images as sharp as those caught on photographic film 


-  Because the technology they are using to capture sharper images is expensive ,  they have also violated test #1: The equipment isnt cheap enough to appeal to existing camera owners ,  most of whom are satisfied with the pictures they get from photographic film 


-  Had they instead built their cameras with cheap sensors ,  whose sharpness is more than adequate for images viewed on computer screens ,  they could have hit price points low enough to have competed against nonconsumption  selling fun ,  not cameras ,  to teenagers and children ,  who use the Internet with extraordinary creativity 


-  Whether that happens after  brutal ,  feature-for-feature fight involving sustaining technology  or after  huge new growth market is created among  new set of customers who have found new ways and reasons for consuming images depends on whether the companies in this space shape their strategies to create disruptive growth or allow the default settings of sustaining strategy to determine their targets 


-  ,  Some ideas for innovative products simply cant be shaped to pass the first set of tests 


-   quite different strategy  disrupting the industry leaders business model  also harnesses the power of asymmetric motivation 


-  ,   proposal that cannot compete against nonconsumption necessarily aims at the same markets dominated by industry leaders 


-  First ,  it must target the least-demanding tiers of  market in which prevailing products are so good they overserve customers 


-  In other words ,  there must be less demanding customers who would happily buy  good-enough product that is cheaper than those currently available 


-  Second ,  the product must be made and marketed within  disruptive business model ,  one that enables the entrant to compete profitably while pricing at deep discounts 


-  Managers who shape  strategy to conform to these litmus tests can successfully create  new growth business within an existing market 


-  ,  Test #1: Are prevailing products more than good enough? ,  If available products arent yet good enough ,   disruptive innovation whose performance is even lower will not gain any traction in the market 


-  Mobile telephone networks probably fall into the category of not yet good enough to be disrupted with this strategy; many pharmaceutical products also fit this description 


-  For example ,  synthetic insulin that is free of impurities couldnt disrupt the market for insulin made from  pigs pancreas  ( which contains some impurities )  because neither is effective enough to counteract the long-term effects of Type  diabetes 


-  ,  Managers who are shaping  disruptive strategy can determine when  products performance has overshot what customers can use by examining rigorously ,  market tier by market tier ,  the extent to which customers are willing to pay premium prices for further improvements in the functionality ,  reliability or convenience of  product or service 


-  If companies can sustain price increases in  given tier when they introduce an improvement in one of these areas ,  customers are not yet overserved and that tier cannot be disrupted 


-  In the late 1990s ,  hundreds of millions of dollars were invested to create exchanges for commodities such as steel; their objective was to disrupt traditional distribution enterprises 


-  The vast majority of the worlds steel ,  however ,  is not purchased at the lowest price the buyer can find 


-  Steel buyers quite consistently pay premium prices to be assured of reliable supplies from their distributors 


-  The prevalence of the price premiums indicates that buyers are not yet overserved on the dimension of reliability and thus the market could not be disrupted by the online exchanges 


-  ,  Test #2: Can you create  different business model? ,  If the low end of  market is overserved and thus open to disruption ,  the second test requires managers to craft  new business model; the business must be able to earn attractive returns at prices that can steal business at the low end 


-   disruptive business model consists of  cost structure ,  operating processes and  distribution system in which profit margins are thinner but net asset turns are higher 


-  It creates the asymmetric motivation needed for disruptive success 


-  Discount retailers such as Wal-Mart and Kmart attacked the low end of the market  nationally branded hard goods such as paint ,  hardware ,  kitchen utensils ,  toys and sporting goods that were so commonplace they could sell themselves 


-  The low end of this market was over-served by department stores; customers did not need well-trained salespeople to help them get what they needed 


-  The discounters business model enabled them to make money at gross margins of about 23% 


-  ,  For good reasons ,  full-service retailers ceded the low end of the market to the discounters 


-  At the time discount retailers attacked the low end of their merchandise mix ,  managers of full-service stores could have defended the branded hard-goods businesses ,  which the discounters were attacking with prices that were 20% below those of department stores 


-  But competing against the discounters by matching their prices would have sent margins plummeting to 23% ,  and ,  given the three-times-per-year inventory turns inherent in their business model ,  ROCII would have dropped to about 70% 


-  Clearly ,  it made sense for the full-service department stores to get out of the tiers of the market that the discounters were motivated to enter 


-  Discount retailers subsequently were motivated to move further upmarket into the lowest-margin tiers of clothing ,  home furnishings and cosmetics 


-  ,  This is the sort of asymmetry of motivation that managers need to create if they hope to build  successful new growth business within the same market served by industry leaders 


-  To do that ,  managers must start by asking: How much lower does our price need to be to penetrate the lowest tier of the market? What do our costs need to be to generate profits at that price level? How could we change our asset turns and operating processes to achieve attractive returns? ,  If  hopeful entrant cant define  business model with high-enough asset turns to earn attractive returns on low margins ,  it wont be able to attract the repeated capital investments required to sustain the upmarket march inherent in building  business 


-  As we have reviewed business plans requesting corporate funds for new product development ,  we have been dismayed to see how few of the plans developers have devised business models that can sustain  disruptive enterprise 


-  Steel minimills such as Nucor have used this strategy to beat the integrated steel companies like Bethlehem ,  and online travel agencies are using it to disrupt full-service agencies 


-  ,  Executives who are shaping  low-end disruptive business-model strategy need to be sure it is unattractive to every powerful incumbent 


-  The Internet helped Medco make more money in the way it was already structured to make money; and because Medco had far more resources to throw at the opportunity than startups did ,  it outdistanced the startups and drove them from the market 


-  ,  To get  sense of how managers might use the litmus tests to shape an idea into  disruptive business plan ,  lets examine whether Xerox could disrupt Hewlett-Packards ink-jet printing business 


-  We dont actually know if Xerox has considered this possibility ,  and we use the companies names only to make the example more vivid 


-  What can the company do with it? It could attempt to leapfrog ahead of Hewlett-Packard by producing the best ink-jet printer on the market 


-  Could Xerox craft  disruptive strategy for this technology? Well use the litmus tests for the disruptive business model strategy first 


-  ,  To assess whether  low-end strategy is viable ,  Xeroxs managers should examine whether customers in each tier of the market are willing to pay price premiums for improvements in performance  faster printers that produce sharper images 


-  It appears ,  however ,  that consumers in less demanding tiers are increasingly indifferent to improvements 


-  So the first litmus test is met: It does seem that  set of customers would be willing to buy  good enough printer that is cheaper than prevailing products 


-  ,  The next litmus test is whether Xerox could define  business model that would generate attractive returns at the discounted prices required to win business at the low end 


-  H-P and other printer companies already out-source the fabrication and assembly of components to the lowest-cost sources in the world 


-  They make all their money selling ink cartridges 


-  Xerox could enter the market by selling ink cartridges at lower prices ,  but unless it could define processes that would allow it to do so profitably ,  any lead it gained initially would be unsustainable 


-  ,  Is there  large ,  untapped population of computer users who dont have the skills to operate current printers or the money to buy one? Probably not 


-  Hewlett-Packard and its competitors already competed successfully against nonconsumption when they launched their easy-to-use ,  inexpensive ink-jet printers to disrupt expensive laser printers 


-  ,  Could Xerox use its technology to help customers do something more easily that they are already trying to do? Is there  low-performance product that people would happily buy? Quite possibly 


-  Documents created on notebook computers are not easy to print 


-  Notebook users have to find  stationary printer and either hook its cable to the computer or transfer the file to  desktop PC via floppy disk in order to get paper copies 


-  If Xerox incorporated  simple ,  inexpensive printer into the base or back of  notebook computer so that users on the go could get hard copies when they needed them ,  where they needed them ,  the company could probably win customers even if the printer wasnt as good as  stationary ink jet 


-  In this case ,  we would expect H-P to ignore the notebook-printer opportunity at the outset because of the other options competing for resources within H-Ps huge printer business ,  which needs large chunks of new revenue to sustain its growth 


-  To create as much asymmetry as possible ,  Xerox would also want to develop  business model that was attractive to Xerox but unattractive to H-P 


-  This might entail pricing ink cartridges for embedded notebook printers at levels that would send H-P scurrying upmarket ,  in search of the larger profits generated by higher-performance stationary printers 


-  In this context ,  we use the term values to mean the criteria that people employ when making both big and small decisions  when giving priority to one set of activities over another 


-  Such choices can be the kiss of death ,  however ,  because the kinds of challenges that will confront managers in building  new disruptive enterprise are radically different from those that most would have grappled with in the core business 


-  The counterintuitive point is that managers whom corporate leaders have learned to trust because of their success in the mainstream business probably cannot be counted on to lead  radical new venture 


-  ,  To choose the right managers to lead  new venture ,  its useful to construct  three-column chart 


-  In the middle column ,  list the experiences the managers should already have had ,  to be certain they have the perspective to succeed 


-  ,  Thus in the left column ,  Xeroxs managers might note that customers for the built-in printer probably would not know at the outset what features theyd need or when or how they would actually use the product 


-  In the middle column ,  they would specify  manager who had successfully and unsuccessfully introduced new products in  fluid ,  emerging market 


-  In the right column ,  they might evaluate the rsum of  product manager from Palm because some features of Palms products have been warmly embraced ,  while others have bombed 


-  Having barely enough forces the ventures managers to flounder around with actual customers ,  rather than in the corporate treasury ,  for ways to get money 


-  Tight purse strings force managers to uncover  viable strategy quickly  if one exists 


-  ,  The second misconception is that the corporation needs to be patient  that it should be prepared to accept large losses for sustained periods in order to reap the huge upside that eventually comes from disruptive innovation 


-  It takes time for new markets to emerge: Customers have to discover where ,  when and why they are using  new product ,  and the new venture has to define  profitable business model 


-  All new ventures lose money for  time at the outset ,  but corporate executives should expect the managers of  new business to find  way to make profit within  couple of years 


-  Small but profitable ventures need to be given time to establish the new market and grow to  substantial size 


- 10 ,  Processes and Values In any company ,  mainstream processes and criteria for setting priorities  ( values )  have been honed to sustain the core business 


-  Typically ,  key processes that work well in the core  ( such as strategic planning and product development )  actually impede what needs to be done in an emerging business 


-  And the criteria for setting priorities and making decisions that are inherent to the business model of the new enterprise often must be very different from those that are useful in the mainstream 


-  ,   key to nurturing  new growth business is recognizing when to leverage the parent corporations resources ,  processes and values ,  and when to create new ones 


-  In our experience ,  the CEO has to make this judgment because there are no simple rules to follow 


-  There is strong evidence that without the CEOs intervention ,  the power of habitual ways of doing things will direct new ventures into the sustaining mode  and the core business must be sustained ,  after all ,  even as the new one is nurtured 


-  In the mid-1990s ,  dArbeloff sensed that competitors were considering  scaled-down tester that would rely on inexpensive semiconductor chips and off-the-shelf software 


-  Such  product could test simple circuits at the low end of the market ,  at  quarter of the multimillion dollar cost of Teradynes machines 


-  ,  DArbeloff decided to get there first and set up  separate business unit to disrupt the market  and Teradyne itself 


-  One of the keys to the development of what became the successful Integra tester business was flexibility to create appropriate processes for annual budgets ,  sales projections and strategic planning ,  compared with the standards that would have been imposed if the project had been part of  mainstream division 


-  The venture was ,  however ,  kept to very tight cost controls 


-  Moreover ,  dArbeloff kept the values guiding the project clear: The product was to be simple and low-cost 


-  The team developing it had to find  market that would welcome an inexpensive tester with limited functionality 


-  But in our interviews with managers of companies that failed to capitalize on disruptive opportunities ,  not once did anyone say ,  We just never thought of it 


-  We have suggested how executives might shape and implement  strategy to create  single new disruptive growth business 


-  To establish an organizational capability to do it over and over again ,  senior executives should build the components that go into an innovation engine 


-  To build what will be  respectable portfolio of growth businesses in five years ,  start now  and add to the portfolio every year 


-  Companies that build while they are growing can shield their nascent high-potential businesses from Wall Street pressure ,  giving each one the time it needs to iterate toward  viable strategy and then to take off 


-  ,  Establish an Aggregate Project Plan An aggregate project plan is  system to allocate resources toward strategic objectives 


-  The plan must be established before managers have considered the merits of specific product proposals; it then can be used to help company leaders systematically distribute resources to new growth businesses 


-  To determine what percentage of available resources they should allocate to disruptive new ventures ,  executives must decide in advance the number of such businesses the company needs to start or acquire each year in order to have robustly growing businesses five and 10 years down the road ,  when growth of the core business has slowed 


-  Propositions for new growth businesses compete only for the planned number of disruptive slots in the plan in  given year ,  and sustaining ideas are matched against other sustaining possibilities 


-  As  result ,  companies need to create different processes for evaluating and shaping disruptive ideas 


-  Sales ,  marketing and engineering employees have the great ideas in most companies 


-  They should be trained in the language of sustaining and disruptive innovation and understand the litmus tests so that they know what kinds of ideas they should channel into sustaining processes  and what kinds they should direct into disruptive channels 


-  Capturing ideas for new growth businesses from people in direct contact with markets and technologies is far more productive than relying on analyst-laden business-development departments 


-  Front-line employees are also well positioned to scout for small acquisitions with disruptive potential 


-  If the price is reasonable ,  it is often better to acquire  company whose strategy passes the litmus tests than to start from scratch internally 


-  Senior management should therefore create  team at the corporate level that is responsible for collecting disruptive-innovation ideas and molding them into propositions that fit the litmus tests 


-  The members of this team have to understand the litmus tests at  deep level and use them repeatedly 


-  Such experience will help the team develop  collective intuition about how to shape disruptive business plans 


-  We use the word intuition deliberately here 


-  While the process that molds ideas into sustaining innovations can be deliberate ,  data-driven and analytical ,  the process for shaping disruptive businesses must be driven by intuitive understanding of the possibilities 


-  Between 1950 and 1980 Sony introduced 12 disruptions that created huge new growth markets and helped the company topple competitors that had been the leaders in the electronics industry 


-  Between 1980 and 1997 ,  Sony continued to be technologically innovative ,  but every innovation during this period was sustaining 


-  Sonys PlayStation and Vaio notebook computers ,  for example ,  are great products ,  but they were late entrants targeted at well-established markets 


-  How did the companys ability to develop sustaining innovations come to squeeze out its ability to continue generating disruptive ones? ,  Before 1980 ,  Sony founder Akio Morita and  small group of trusted associates made every new product-launch decision 


-  As  policy ,  they never did any market research  if  market did not exist ,  they believed ,  it could not be analyzed 


-  The company began beefing up its marketing functions with  


-  who favored the use of data-driven ,  analytical processes to assess market needs 


-  Such processes can only identify and shape sustaining innovations  and as  consequence ,  Sony lost its ability to continue launching disruptive businesses 


-  ,  Because all corporations that hope to sustain growth need streams of sustaining innovations within business units and disruptive innovations in new units ,  we advocate the creation of  Sony-like group at the corporate level that develops  similar practiced intuition about disruptive ventures 


-  The process for selecting managers needs to employ very different criteria from those used to promote managers within established businesses 


-  It should define and articulate throughout the company the technology or market scope governing disruptive business plans 


-  Twice  year or so ,  team members should hold refresher training sessions with sales ,  marketing and engineering people in each operating unit 


-  Such updates are critical because they can help innovators within the corporation refine their ability to recognize disruptive innovations when they encounter them 


-  ,  Processes are not created in PowerPoint presentations; they are defined only when  group of people does something over and over again 


-  This is why intuitive processes for creating disruptive growth businesses need to be honed in  dedicated group 


-  ,  The structure of our proposed innovation engine is quite different from  conventionally managed corporate venture-capital organization 


-  But it only appears random ,  we believe ,  because managers havent understood the factors that lead to success or cause failure 


-  Spending too much on the wrong strategy in an attempt to get big fast; putting people with inappropriate experience in charge; violating the litmus tests; and launching growth initiatives in an ad hoc manner when it is already too late  these reasons for failure can be managed and avoided 


-  Executives who understand the potential pitfalls and work to make the creation of disruptive new businesses  corporate process  an organizational capability that is constantly practiced  can start laying the groundwork for  company future blessed by continuous healthy growth
