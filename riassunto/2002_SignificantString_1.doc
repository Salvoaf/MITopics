- Talk to the senior executives of any progressive company today and they will tell you about its huge investments in innovation ,  bulging new-product pipelines ,  proprietary technologies and relentless drive to shrink time to market 


-  Theyll also admit that these efforts have not helped them outrun the competition 


-  Although businesses are moving faster than ever ,  competitors are constantly nipping at their heels ,  emulating new products ,  replicating entire product-development systems and processes ,  and keeping pace on the same treadmill 


-  New products may generate hefty returns ,  but the advantage is short-lived 


-  ,  Eroding competitive leads are the result of forces that are equalizing companies ability to innovate: the increasingly rapid and free flow of information and knowledge ,  the movement to global standards and the advent of open markets for components and technologies 


-  Thanks to open markets and open standards ,  Handspring has access to the same product designers and manufacturers that Palm uses 


-  ,  This example is not the exception ,  and it raises profound questions about the sources of sustainable competitive advantage 


-  If product parity is relatively easily achieved in todays world ,  customers will turn to new criteria when deciding to buy one companys products over anothers 


-  In particular ,  we have focused on this question: Why do your customers choose to buy from you rather than from your competition?  ( See About the Research 


-  They agreed almost universally that offering great products ,  technologies or services is merely an entry stake into the competitive arena 


-  Most spoke of the need to maintain an edge in the way their companies interact with customers; that is ,  they recognized that customers often value how they interact with their suppliers as much as or more than what they actually buy 


-  As the main drivers of customer choice ,  the executives cited cost-oriented factors like convenience ,  ease of doing business and product support ,  as well as risk-oriented factors like trust ,  confidence and the strength of relationships 


-  ,  Although many managers realize the need to pay attention to cost and risk factors that influence customer choice ,  our research data indicate that companies are usually at  loss when it comes to translating this conceptual understanding into practice 


-  We did find counterexamples ,  however: companies that are using one of five strategies to build competitive advantage through their approach to customers 


-  Before we turn to the strategies ,  well take  closer look at how perceptions of cost and risk affect customers 


-  ,  When product improvements can be matched quickly by competitors ,  companies have only two remaining levers available to influence purchase decisions: They can reduce customers interaction costs or make the purchase and subsequent product ownership  less risky proposition 


-  ,  Start with the issue of lowering costs 


-   buyer incurs  variety of costs in the course of learning about  sellers products and services ,  acquiring them ,  using them and finally disposing of them 


-  In addition ,  to extract value from the product ,  the buyer must configure the product to his or her needs 


-  That can be as simple as chilling  beer before drinking it and as complex as integrating  new organizationwide software system with the existing IT infrastructure 


-  Finally ,  when  customer buys  product or service ,  he or she commits to  rigid seller-defined bundle and forgoes the benefits of other potential bundles available in the marketplace 


-  For example ,  when someone buys  family minivan ,  he or she obtains roominess and comfort but can never ,  with that product ,  enjoy the psychological benefits that come from driving  convertible 


-  Most companies never attend to such costs ,  but they are real 


-  Managers who give thought to ways to reduce these interaction costs will likely uncover innovative ways of increasing customers gain 


-  ,  In addition to the generally hidden costs that customers face when they try to decide on  supplier ,  buyers also take on considerable risk and uncertainty 


-  Can  trust the sellers promises? Will the product perform as expected? Will  be able to implement it successfully? Will  lose money? Will the seller be around for repair and maintenance? When potential customers feel that the risk is high that their expectations will not be met ,  they quite naturally choose not to buy 


-  Many companies have been in situations in which customers stick with the industry leaders product even though their new product is either of superior quality or cheaper or both  in their calculus of risk ,  customers prefer to wait until the new offering has been clearly recognized as superior for some time before they make  switch 


-  Of course ,  the buyer can engage in due diligence to address questions of risk ,  but due diligence costs time ,  effort and money  in other words ,  it raises the interaction costs 


-  Theyve reconsidered exactly what it is they are selling ,  theyve leveraged strengths to make customers lives easier ,  theyve worked with other organizations to provide an optimal  ( and unique )  bundle of products and so on 


-   review of the strategies theyve followed can provide managers in almost any industry with new ways of thinking about building advantage with customers 


-  ,  All companies recognize the power of economies of scale ,  scope and experience in producing better or cheaper products 


-  Consider that suppliers often have many interactions of the same type with different customers  ( scale )  ,  many interactions with the same customer  ( scope )  ,  and access to information that makes it easier for them to gauge the risks involved in an activity for  particular customer  ( experience )  


-  To increase their customers sense of expected gain from  transaction ,  companies can reconfigure their activities to lower buyers interaction costs and perceived risk 


-  For example ,   supplier may be able to identify tasks that its customers have in common and decide that it can perform them more cheaply or effectively 


-  By taking responsibility for the tasks ,  suppliers can save their customers time and money and effectively lock them in 


-  ,  Consider Master Builders recent launch of its MasterTrac system 


-  Master Builders sells chemical admixtures that are used to improve the performance characteristics of concrete; its customers include concrete producers that have many locations and either  regional or national presence 


-  Until the new system was put in place ,  managers at each of the producers locations independently ordered and maintained inventory of each type of additive to suit their local requirements 


-  The small shipments were not cost effective ,  and emergency shipments were often necessary when customers failed to anticipate their needs correctly 


-  ,  To meet this challenge ,  Master Builders developed  remote tank-monitoring system for immediate and seamless inventory control 


-  The MasterTrac system consists of additive storage tanks fitted with wireless sensors that ,  when queried ,  relay inventory information to  Web site accessible to both Master Builders and the customer 


-  Under the new system ,  the customer realizes major savings from reduced inventory financing ,  reduced order and payment processing ,  and reduced inventory management time 


-  Competitors that seek to win over the customer now face  much harder task 


-  ,  Suppliers may also gain  sustainable advantage by reducing their customers risk ,  especially if they leverage their experience and reach 


-  Asea Brown Boveri found  way to do that in its tubular products business 


-  Although the product requires some technological know-how to manufacture ,  it is basically  pipe with threading welded onto it 


-  In 1999 ,  ABB was the world leader in this market but was facing increased competition from low-cost welding shops 


-  ,  Since oil rigs can be located anywhere in the world  ( from Siberia to Vietnam to Chile )  ,  the industry convention was to price the product at the factory gate 


-  Drilling companies would then take ownership and arrange to have the product delivered to the rigs 


-  Their headaches began at this point since delays in getting the pipe to the drilling site were very expensive: Rental prices for an ocean-going drilling rig are $150 , 000 per day 


-  Although the threat of delays was not ABBs problem per se ,  the company recognized an opportunity to shift the terms of the business away from cost 


-  ABB was uniquely positioned to take on that task for its customers 


-  Because of its many business units in various industries ,  the company had  well-established presence in more than 100 countries ,  and its oil and gas unit understood the import regulations worldwide for the drilling business 


-  Even though ABB charged for these deliveries at cost ,  the increased value to the customer in terms of lower risk was much more significant 


-  ,  Over time ,  ABBs position as the market leader solidified because competitors lacked the global reach and expertise required to offer contracts that guaranteed delivery 


-  ABB succeeded by looking at its interaction pattern with customers in all its businesses and finding an area where its risk was lower than that of its customers and competitors 


-  ABBs product hasnt changed ,  but the new way of offering it has increased its customers expected gain from their purchases 


-  ,  Its  given that companies must offer high-quality products if they want to succeed 


-  Its also  given that the products themselves ,  even when theyre very good ,  rarely provide all the benefits that customers are looking for 


-  The trick for companies is to redefine their offerings in ways that make it easy for customers to get the benefits they seek 


-  ,  The Australian division of ICI Explosives took an innovative approach to helping its customers reap the benefits of one of the most unglamorous products imaginable: pieces of rock 


-  ICI ,  like its competitors ,  had long sold commodity explosives to quarries 


-  The quarries used these explosives to blast solid rock into aggregates of equal size 


-  The customers challenge is to turn the rock face into  product that can be sold; an ineffective blast will yield large chunks of rock that are much harder to break down 


-  As such ,  designing  successful blast requires considerable expertise and has  major effect on profitability 


-  As many as 20 parameters affect the performance of the blast ,  including the profile of the rock face ,  the depth and diameter of the drill holes ,  and the weather 


-  ICI ,  recognizing the risk that customers face ,  began  program to quantify what had previously been considered an art 


-  Using computer models and experimentation ,  ICI engineers developed strategies and procedures that narrowed the uncertainty of blast performance 


-  Instead of selling this new expertise as an added service ,  however ,  ICI began performing the blasts for the quarries and writing contracts for broken rock 


-  ,  The new contracts significantly reduce the business costs and risk faced by customers in two ways 


-  First ,  they turn fixed costs  ( primarily quarry employees and drilling equipment )  into variable ones and second ,  they set the performance of  blast at an acceptable minimum level 


-  ICI is no longer simply  supplier of commodity explosives; it has become an integral part of its customers business 


-  ,  To create value beyond products ,  companies have to recognize that tangible goods are what they are: rigid ,  inflexible packages that impose an opportunity cost  the cost of forgoing alternatives  on the customer 


-  Premier Auto Group ,  the luxury arm of Ford that manages brands such as Jaguar ,  Land Rover and Volvo ,  understands that its product offering may be too much of  constraint for its customers 


-  Customers will not purchase  car but rather  mobility contract from PAG that will allow them to use  sedan ,   limousine ,   sport utility vehicle or  convertible ,  depending on the customers needs 


-  ,  Companies can systematically configure offerings that create value by simplifying the route to the benefits that customers seek 


-  And suppliers can find  new source of competitive advantage if they can better perform certain tasks or better absorb related risks or costs than their customers can ,  all while producing the same benefits 


-  Companies can avoid the need to be wholly responsible by taking  collaborative approach  that is ,  by integrating various activities with their customers as  means of lowering risk and costs 


-  ,   division of Magna International has integrated its activities with one of its major customers ,  DaimlerChrysler ,  to help the automobile giant meet its production needs 


-  Magna International is one of the worlds largest and most diversified automobile parts suppliers; it has 166 manufacturing divisions and 31 product-development and engineering centers in 18 countries 


-  Radical changes in the automotive industry ,  however ,  have forced the company to change as well 


-  Product and model life cycles have been drastically reduced; consumers are more fickle than ever; and competitors are aggressive in their pursuit of market share 


-  Not surprisingly ,  demand for any given model of car is notoriously difficult to forecast ,  and automobile manufacturers need to be agile enough to respond rapidly to changes in the market 


-  ,  To help manufacturers attain such operational flexibility ,  Magna International created Magna Steyr 


-  This division is not merely an arms length parts supplier 


-   few years ago ,  Magna Steyr was able to solve DaimlerChryslers enviable problem of excess demand for the Mercedes-Benz M-class sport utility vehicle 


-  Magna Steyr had already been involved with DaimlerChrysler in the production of E-class Mercedes sedans and the Jeep Grand Cherokee and was accustomed to working closely with DaimlerChrysler engineers and regularly receiving information on demand forecasts 


-  So when at the end of 1998 worldwide demand for the M-class SUV outstripped total capacity at DaimlerChryslers plant in Tuscaloosa ,  Alabama ,  Magna Steyr was called in to provide backup 


-  Magna Steyrs integration with DaimlerChrysler was so seamless that the company might be confused for  division of DaimlerChrysler 


-  AXIS specializes in the production of machinery for the manufacture of electric motors used in the automotive ,  domestic appliance ,  and power tool industries ,  and it has  reputation for quality and technical expertise 


-  But in  mature and competitive industry ,  those strengths were proving insufficient 


-  Customers like Black  Decker and Philips were increasingly concerned with their ability to reduce time to market and meet peak-season demand and were ,  as  result ,  turning  critical eye on their suppliers 


-  ,  After AXISs managers had made that decision ,   power tool manufacturer contracted with the company to supply  new production line for  nonstandard electric motor needed to make  new product 


-  Space was limited and labor costs were  concern ,  so the line had to be relatively compact and highly automated 


-  Using  Web-based three-dimensional CAD system ,  AXIS worked with the customers engineers to optimize design concepts and help the customer create performance metrics under different operating circumstances and configurations 


-  After the basic concept was agreed on ,  AXIS engineers designed the production line ,  sharing drawings ,  specifications and other data in real time with the customers engineers 


-  An improvement on that order normally would have been integrated into the next version of the product ,  but now it could be built into the original design 


-  ,  Once the production machinery design was completed and approved ,  the documents were sent to the production team and stored online in  folder open to everyone involved in the project 


-  Later ,  as the production team began work on building the line ,  they realized that the engineers had been optimistic about the amount of work needed to construct one of the peripheral machines 


-  To prevent triggering  slippage notice ,  they informed the designers in both organizations and referred them to drawings produced for an earlier project that might prove to be an adequate fix 


-  Production delays were minimized ,  and the customer was able to get the product to market on schedule 


-  Documents from the production phase were also stored online and made accessible to in-field maintenance people in both companies 


-  ,  The sharing of information and business-process integration at every step of the way were major factors in the customers successful launch of the new product 


-  The customer enjoyed unprecedented control over the design and creation of the new production line and is likely to return to AXIS for related needs in the future 


-  ,   trusted supplier can turn itself into  market maker for many products and services that it doesnt actually produce  and make money in the process 


-  By being the link between customers and the sellers of complementary products and services ,  the supplier reduces buyers search and acquisition costs by certifying only qualified contacts 


-  At the same time ,  the supplier increases the number of customer touch points and thus its claims on customer loyalty 


-  ,  NTT DoCoMo is the nexus for many suppliers and customers that produce and use mobile Internet products and services 


-  The foundation for i-modes success is DoCoMos coordination of all aspects of the mobile Internet experience: hardware ,  access ,  services and billing 


-  Such coordination lowers interaction costs and risks for customers by making it easy to use the service while guaranteeing consistency 


-  ,  In terms of hardware ,  for example ,  DoCoMo has worked closely with suppliers like Sony ,  Panasonic and Fujitsu to standardize i-mode handsets 


-  The company has simplified access and use by building the service around  single portal that is available only through i-mode-enabled phones and by making it easy to navigate through  , 600 DoCoMo-certified sites from the portal 


-  Web sites are keen to be endorsed by DoCoMo and are willing to adapt their offerings to DoCoMo standards for the privilege of being able to reach millions of users  who ,  in turn ,  get instant access to  critical mass of content and services 


-  Subscribers receive  single ,  itemized monthly bill ,  and because they get only one invoice from  trusted source ,  they are more apt to try new services than they would be through fixed-line Internet connections ,  where payment and verification are required for each site independently 


-  By earning the trust needed to occupy the center of the mobile Internet ,  DoCoMo is offering value to hardware suppliers ,  content providers and millions of i-mode users 


-  Intuits QuickBooks has an 85% share of the small-business-accounting software market and  98% customer loyalty rating 


-  But the more interesting story is how Intuit has been able to capitalize on its success with QuickBooks to capture an ever bigger share of small-business expenditures on information and data handling 


-  Services such as QuickBooks Site Solutions  ( an Internet tool that enables small businesses to create  professional Internet presence )  and QuickBooks Online Payroll have deepened its interaction with customers while reducing their risk and cost 


-  ,  More recently ,  Intuit has opened up access to the application-programming interfaces for the QuickBooks products 


-  Third-party developers are now able to create software applications that are integrated into the QuickBooks platform 


-  Intuits move significantly reduces the small businesss cost of obtaining these solutions ,  since integration with its own internal procedures is guaranteed 


-  The QuickBooks seal of approval also reduces the customers risk incurred in the selection of  new supplier or software 


-  By allowing third-party developers to trade on its platform of trust ,  Intuit has placed itself at the nexus of suppliers and buyers in the industry 


-  ,  Companies often have to collaborate with other organizations to help form the future  in other words ,  to shape businesses and products that will change the way commerce happens 


-  This is especially true for new technologies in the networked economy ,  which are rarely the product of  single company 


-  And what any business today has to realize is that the customers sense of risk is nowhere greater than when it is contemplating large cap-for any company developing  new technology ,  then ,  is to seek ways to lower the risks and costs from the early stages of product development onward  that is ,  even before  polished product is ready for  mass audience 


-  Sometimes ,  as the story of SAMSys Technologies indicates ,  that even means giving up on your core product 


-  The technology works like this: Objects are tagged with semiconductors that emit radio frequencies and can then communicate with one another and with people 


-  The range of potential applications is staggering  for example ,  RFID could be used to inventory entire warehouses at the touch of  button or to get information about the contents of transport trucks and containers without opening them 


-   recent Accenture study found that RFID technology could save $70 billion in the supply chain by reducing inefficiencies in inventory carrying costs ,  shrinkage and labor 


-  The hesitation has been caused by the lack of universal frequency and protocol standards ,  as well as the rapid evolution of tag technology 


-  ,  SAMSys was an early entrant in the RFID industry ,  and by 1998 it had developed  complete solution of tags and reader hardware 


-  When the company realized that RFID adoption was slow relative to its potential ,  it moved to boost sales in the industry as  whole rather than focus on promoting its own solution 


-  It recognized that customers would value  tag reader that was agnostic in terms of frequency and protocol so that they could invest in any RFID system without fear of incompatibility 


-  SAMSys decided to develop such  reader ,  but it knew that to succeed it needed to convince large players of its vision: tag suppliers ,  package makers and RFID system users 


-  ,  To influence tag suppliers like Texas Instruments ,  Philips and Motorola ,  SAMSys had to position itself as  complementor rather than  competitor 


-  Even though the large tag suppliers had their own ,  proprietary line of readers ,  they saw the SAMSys vision of universal readers as  way of decoupling their tag and reader product lines and significantly growing the tag business 


-  Texas Instruments and Philips are now SAMSyss alliance partners rather than its competitors 


-  ,  SAMSys next focused on the package suppliers  the companies that make the packages that house the RFID tags 


-  Over  period of several months ,  SAMSys persuaded International Paper ,  one of the largest packaging companies in the world ,  to enter into  strategic alliance 


-  International Paper now sees SAMSyss RFID solution as  way to add value to its paper-packaging products 


-  ,  Finally ,  SAMSys ,  in collaboration with its partners ,  developed  series of pilot projects to demonstrate the power of its standard-free RFID vision 


-  SAMSys has created multiproto-col readers that can be configured to fit each project 


-  ,  As products from competing companies become increasingly similar ,  differences in the way rivals interact with their customers are becoming more and more important 


-  Theres no doubt in our minds that strategies built around reducing customers interaction costs and risk are central to these differences; they offer  systematic way to tap into new sources of customer value 


-  Make no mistake: It is easy to underestimate the difficulties involved in shifting  companys focus from products to customer interactions 


-  Tactical marketing responses cant get the job done because they do the opposite of what is needed ,  adding to interactions rather than streamlining them 


-  But the tremendous untapped opportunities for creating value and establishing long-term advantage should ,  we believe ,  be enough to convince any senior executive of the superiority of  mind-set that starts with customers rather than products
