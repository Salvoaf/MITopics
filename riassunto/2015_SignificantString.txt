-  Facebook ,  Google ,  Amazon ,  and Apple  many of todays most successful technology businesses have at their core  platform-based business model 


-  Platforms are multisided networks that bring together two or more distinct types of users and facilitate transactions among them 


-  eBay ,  for instance ,  links buyers and sellers; Playstation links game developers with gamers; Apples App Store transfers applications from software developers to iPhone and iPad users 


-  Increasingly ,  entrepreneurial startups are embracing  platform approach; look no further than fast-growing young companies such as Uber and Airbnb 


-  ,  Today ,  many entrepreneurs and established businesses are trying to copy the success of existing platform businesses 


-  Executives often assume that the key is to grow the sheer number of users and developers as quickly as possible ,  believing that get big fast is the most reliable way to win  competitive advantage 


-  ,  The reality is more complex 


-  The profit potential of  platform that dominates  market is enormous ,  but  lot can go wrong along the way  as examples from  number of industries illustrate 


-   large supply of increasingly varied content increases the value of the platform to consumers and encourages more users to join it 


-  The aim is to create  virtuous circle: The more the audience grows ,  the greater developers incentive to contribute to the platform ,  and the greater its attraction to consumers 


-  Another strategy is to offer limited but exceptional content and entice customers with killer apps that are only available on the platform 


-  ,  Sometimes ,  however ,  companies try to combine these approaches: Offer  lot of content ,  but make sure some of it is exceptional and exclusive to the platform 


-  This third way sounds good in theory ,  but our research shows that combining these strategies usually creates problems 


-  )  The case of Groupon Inc 


-  ,  the online coupon company ,  exemplifies the risks of pursuing unfocused growth 


-  ,  Between 2008 and 2012 ,  Groupons management followed an aggressive growth strategy on all fronts 


-  Of the five explicit objectives detailed in Groupons strategy in its 2012 10-K filing ,  four related directly to growth:  (  )  grow the number of merchants;  (  )  grow the customer base;  (  )  globalize the platform; and  (  )  expand through acquisitions and business development partnerships 


-  The fifth objective was to position the company to benefit from and drive technological changes affecting consumer behavior 


-  Although in theory this fifth objective was not necessarily related to growth ,  in practice it meant working to expand Groupons presence in smartphones and tablets 


-  ,  Groupons decision to enroll as many merchants as possible on its platform in effect set local businesses against each other in  discounting war  the last situation most businesses want 


-  Moreover ,  Groupon had sought exclusivity clauses that limited merchants ability to offer other online promotions near the time of their Groupon deal 


-  ,  While focusing on getting big fast ,  Groupon struggled to differentiate itself from competitors 


-  Between the companys initial public offering in November 2011 and the end of 2012 ,  Groupons stock price dropped more than 75% ,  and in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 ,  the companys combined net losses attributable to common stockholders totaled about $440 million 


-  Now the company is working to correct its past mistakes ,  but its success is not assured 


-  ,  The failure to make clear strategic choices can hurt players in  number of ways 


-  It also makes it easy to alienate potential partners 


-  Securing exclusive content can entail sweetheart deals that trade exclusivity for lower royalties ,  joint marketing and promotion expenses ,  or technical support 


-  For example ,  both Nintendo and Sega had  reputation in the 1990s for giving better tools to their internal game developers than to outsiders 


-  This alienated developers of nonexclusive products ,  as they perceived that the structure put them at either  cost or technical disadvantage 


-  This is what happened in the video game industry to the video game platforms Saturn ,  Dreamcast ,  Jaguar ,  and 3DO: They failed to take  clear strategic position between  strategic focus on variety and one on exclusivity  and as  result got stuck in the middle ,  to use Harvard Business School professor Michael  


-  ,   second ,  somewhat similar trap is to hedge the platforms bets by trying to win the mass market and  niche at the same time 


-  Our research suggests that platforms that try to capture both at once tend to have  hard time winning either customer base 


- s repositioning strategy with the PlayBook and BlackBerry Z10 offers  case in point 


-  Once  leader in the smartphone market among corporate users because it offered dedicated services such as superior emailing ,  messaging ,  and contacts managing ,  BlackBerry lost out to other devices powered by consumer-oriented rival platforms such as Googles Android and Apples iOS 


-  Instead of trying to focus on preserving its niche ,  RIM ,  which has since changed its name to BlackBerry Ltd 


-  This smorgasbord approach left the company caught in the middle ,  selling products that satisfied neither consumers nor corporate users 


-  Consumers saw no compelling reason to switch from Apple or Android ,  which already offered numerous apps 


-  Nor did corporate customers want entertainment applications cluttering the phones they bought for employees 


-  ,  Making  choice about who your customer should be can be particularly helpful to new platforms in their early days 


-  The social network MySpace ,  for example ,  tried to cater to  wide spectrum of users ,  ranging from teenagers who used it as  virtual hangout to professional musicians who used the platform to engage their fans and promote their songs 


-  This inevitably led to differences in target users demographics and content services between the two competing social networks ,  and gave Facebook  unique identity in the market relative to MySpace 


-  ,  Nintendo Wii is another product that was launched with  deliberate choice about which customers to target 


-  While Sonys Playstation III and Microsofts Xbox 360 geared more of their games toward hard-core gamers ,  the Wii devoted only  quarter of its titles to these popular genres and instead targeted more occasional gamers 


-  This distinctive positioning ,  among other things ,  allowed Nintendo to sell about 10 million units in less than two years following its introduction  nearly three times the number it had sold on its prior ,  less distinct platform 


-  ,  The importance of providing an attractive playing field for high-quality content providers is illustrated by the example of the digital book industry 


-  Amazon had  staggering success with the initial launch of the Kindle in late 2007 ,  and even in early 2010 ,  retained  90% market share in the e-book market 


-  However ,  the companys ability to lure readers to the Kindle platform was hindered by publishers reluctance to publish their newest bestsellers in an e-book format ,  because Amazon insisted on low pricing for e-books 


-  ,  Amazons thinking was that  low price would encourage consumers to accelerate their adoption of Kindle 


-  Publishers ,  however ,  saw  threat to their business model 


-  However ,  publisher obstruction of e-book titles was not  problem when Apple introduced iPads iBook service 


-  Instead of taking Amazons approach ,  Apple designed an ecosystem that allowed publishers to set their own prices ,  giving book publishers an alternative to the Kindle 


-  Nintendo in the 1990s ,  for instance ,  carefully curbed the number of competing video game titles released in its ecosystem and forbade game developers to launch more than five titles 


-  This strategy encouraged game developers to invest in high-quality titles and proved to be highly successful 


-  ,  But in other cases ,  platforms do win by leveraging competition among content developers 


-  Our research suggests that the critical difference is whether one platform dominates the market or if it is competing for  share 


-  Nintendo faced very little competition in the early 1990s ,  being de facto the dominant platform in the video game market at the time 


-  If  platform with strong market power encourages competition ,  developers are left with very little incentive to invest in developing high-quality content  since they are in  market with  platform that has  near-monopoly 


-  By contrast ,  when competing plaftorms represent viable options for content developers ,  such as in the case of Sonys PlayStation and Microsofts Xbox ,  or Apples App Store and Googles Play ,  the platform provider can allow for greater levels of competition among content developers before content developers lose their incentive to develop high-quality content 


-  ,  In general ,  growing the number of users and content suppliers is important in most platform strategies 


-  However ,  our research suggests that platform strategists are sometimes mistaken when they confuse size with the strength of the platforms underlying value proposition  particularly when what looks like  winning proposition for  customer is not always  winning proposition from the content providers point of view 


-  In the end ,  success in  platform business is not  matter simply of collecting apps and eyeballs 


-  Its about creating  proposition that produces value for the suppliers ,  for the customers ,  and for the platform 


-  The initial offering was 21 


- 25 euros per share ,  which represented  premium over the stock price at the time ,  and the supervisory and management boards of Tele Atlas announced their support of the offer 


-  But in autumn of that year ,  Nokia ,  which at that point was  leading cellphone manufacturer ,  announced an agreement to acquire Chicago-based Navteq ,  Tele Atlas main competitor ,  for an astounding price of approximately $8 


-  The control of cartographic databases suddenly became  strategic imperative in the GPS industry 


-  In reaction ,  TomToms main competitor ,  Garmin ,  tried to secure its access to what was now considered as  strategic resource by announcing an offer for Tele Atlas in October 2007 at  higher price of 24 


-  ,  However ,  the Tele Atlas acquisition proved to be an example of the winners curse  the idea that winners in auctions tend to overpay 


-  Moreover ,  TomToms sales declined as the company faced increasing competition from GPS-enabled smartphones; during the period from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2013 ,  TomToms revenues fell more than 40% 


-  Wazes business model was quite different from TomToms: Wazes cartographic data was directly collected from the users ,  at little cost ,  and Google acquired Waze in 2013 for  price in the neighborhood of $1 billion 


-  Seven years after the takeover of Tele Atlas ,  it is clear that TomTom paid too much for  resource that seemed strategic and rare at the time 


-  In this view ,  the essential pillars of strategic success are nonsubstitutable resources and inimitable capabilities ,  and competitive advantage stems from unique and scarce resources 


-  ,  However ,  TomToms example suggests that competing on unique ,  rare and inimitable resources can be risky ,  because acquiring and protecting such resources can be costly; after all ,  most companies in an industry are seeking to obtain them 


-  While strategic resources can yield superior competitive advantage ,  their cost can sometimes outweigh their benefits 


-  In this article ,  we contend that ordinary resources may play an overlooked but important role in successful strategies  and competing with ordinary resources can be  valuable complement to competing with strategic resources 


-  )  ,  In particular ,  the emergence of new business models4 that leverage  vast array of ordinary resources  particularly multisided platform business models5  raises questions about the relevance of the traditional strategic focus on scarcity-based approaches and unique resources 


-  ,  For example ,  Airbnb connects an abundant number of people who want to source out their empty rooms to hirers who are looking for  space for  couple of nights 


-  Airbnbs user-friendly website ,  plain and simple business model and 24/7 customer care service allow people to make use of empty rooms in their homes ,   resource once considered as relatively useless or trivial 


-  Airbnb is expanding its global reach ,  with  presence in 34 , 000 cities and more than 190 countries 


-  Its growth rate is astounding: In 2012 alone ,  the number of listings on the site grew by about 250% 


-  Airbnbs rapid growth indicates that the hospitality industry  an archetypal capital-intensive business  can be disrupted with  totally different approach ,  one involving leveraging underutilized ordinary assets 


-  Given the growth of Internet-enabled platform business models such as Airbnbs ,  it seems time to highlight the strategic value of ordinary resources 


-  ,  The theory behind competing on strategic resources argues that performance differentials between competitors are  direct consequence of their resources 


-  Businesses that hold higher-value resources  ( people ,  technologies ,  reputation ,  partnerships and so on )  should benefit from  competitive advantage if they can manage their resources portfolio properly 


-  As  consequence ,  in order to keep their strategic value ,  resources must be neither perfectly imitable nor substitutable ,  and businesses must carefully defend them 


-  This approach explains many successful strategies ,  and its theoretical significance is unquestionable 


-  However ,  under certain conditions ,  relying too heavily on strategic resources may lead to several risks  such as the bidding war TomTom experienced 


-  Considering the potential of ordinary resources is  way to mitigate these limitations 


-  ,  An ordinary resource is  common resource on the market ,  generally perceived as neutral in terms of performance 


-  While ordinary resources are not ,  in and of themselves ,   source of competitive advantage and greater performance ,  they are generally required for the business to function properly 


-  Examples of ordinary resources include compliance with ISO standards in the automobile industry; stores and salespeople in retailing; and websites and logistics competencies in e-commerce 


-  ,  There is  strategic trade-off between the high-risk/high-gain combination of strategic resources and the low-risk/low-gain pattern associated with ordinary resources 


-  In some circumstances ,  the value of  strategic resource can be captured by the resource itself ,  at the expense of the company using it: For example ,  highly talented stars can use their bargaining power to demand higher compensation 


-  This is notably the case in global industries where the value generated by top talent is readily visible and  profusion of online rankings keeps raising the bar; examples include entertainment ,  professional sports leagues and CEOs of large ,  publicly traded global companies 


-  ,  For instance ,  consider the compensation of top British professional soccer players 


- 10 However ,  in the meantime ,  many of the top clubs in the English Premier League experienced financial losses and/or debt 


-  More than 10 years ago ,  Gary Lineker ,  the former captain of Englands national soccer team ,  was already observing ,  Of course ,  players are taking too much money out of the game ,  but they dont dictate market forces 


-  For instance ,   French film producer recently brought to the fore the idea that French actors were paid too much compared to the revenues generated by movies ,  even in the case of blockbusters 


-  This situation results from the organization of the heavily subsidized French film industry 


-  Many management techniques ,  from Frederick Taylors scientific management13 to modern knowledge management approaches ,  specifically aim at codifying know-how in order to avoid the pitfall of excessive dependence on the specialized knowledge and skills of particular employees 


-  Management scholars Sumantra Ghoshal and Christopher Bartlett once wrote that the key function of management is to help ordinary people produce extraordinary results 


- 14 Creating extraordinary results with unique talents may be great ,  but it is not the general rule in management 


-  The TomTom case demonstrates that once  resource is collectively considered as strategic in an industry ,  access to it becomes  vital challenge ,  and rivals compete to obtain it 


-  Companies whose business models are built around strategic resources are prone to allocate  significant part of their efforts to controlling and securing higher-value assets ,  as exemplified by numerous patent wars in the electronics or the pharmaceutical industries 


-  ,  In contrast ,  ordinary resources are inexpensive ,  and since most businesses overlook their strategic influence ,  their cost usually has no reason to rise 


-  They can be acquired and secured at  comparatively low price ,  and even if they do not provide competitive advantage on their own ,  they may contribute to it 


-  Day-to-day business performance does not rely on uniqueness 


-  If all competitors in an industry attempt to be unique and to possess nonsubstitutable resources and inimitable competencies ,  most of them will fail in that attempt 


-  In truth ,  very few businesses possess unique resources and distinctive competencies that fit the environments threats and opportunities 


-  Focusing exclusively on strategic resources does not explain the everyday performance of the vast majority of businesses ,  which remain profitable and competitive ,  even if they only possess relatively ordinary assets 


-  ,  Gathering  group of executives in order to help them identify the core competencies of their own business  even with the assistance of  series of practical tools such as an activity mapping or  benchmarking process  can be  disappointing exercise 


-  If some companies do possess valuable brands ,  highly talented people ,  deep pockets or patented technologies ,  it does not necessarily provide them with  true competitive advantage ,  for some of their rivals often boast  similar resource portfolio 


-  For instance ,  in the pharmaceutical industry ,  dominant players such as Pfizer ,  Sanofi or Roche possess comparable assets: Little is truly unique in their R&D capacity or in their marketing approach 


-  However ,  this does not prevent those companies from reaching excellent levels of profitability 


-  If the possession of specific resources is the ultimate explanation for success ,  innovation poses  problem: Breakthrough ideas and groundbreaking processes can threaten years of patient accumulation of talents and assets 


-  As  consequence ,   by-the-book implementation of  strategic resource-based approach can lead to inertia 


-  If you are convinced your company possesses unique resources and core competencies ,  you will very probably try to defend and leverage them  and hesitate to implement any disruptive innovation that could jeopardize your strategic commitment 


-  By protecting carefully accumulated rare resources ,  businesses may repel innovation and change 


-  As regards Sony ,  why is it not an absolute winner in the MP3 industry? Sony literally invented portable music devices and pioneered digital music 


-  However ,  in order to protect its unique resources provision ,  it also vertically integrated by acquiring what became Sony Music Entertainment ,   global leader in the music industry 


-  This bold strategic move had  drawback: Once it owned  large music company ,  Sony became very reluctant to enter the MP3 business in the early 2000s ,  for this industry   least at that time  was heavily relying on peer-to-peer piracy 


-  Nokia made  similar mistake: By preserving its unique competencies in design and logistics ,  it refused to admit that with the launch of the iPhone ,  Apple had changed the game from  battle between devices to  war between ecosystems 


-  ,  On the other hand ,  there is growing interest in frugal innovations16 such as the low-cost ChotuKool fridge ,   tiny refrigerator using thermoelectric cooling 


-  The belief in the superiority of key resources may lead competitors to focus too much on  small part of the spectrum of available resources ,  which may restrain their differentiation capability 


-  ,  Ordinary resources can play an important role in creating  competitive advantage in at least two situations: ,  We will now explore these two scenarios 


-  ,  Strategic resources offer limited benefits if you cannot gain value from them 


-  Business models focusing on strategic resources usually underestimate the necessity of ordinary assets ,  day-to-day activities and common talents you must leverage in order to achieve the full-fledged potential of the few strategic resources you master 


-  Moreover ,  companies are usually unable to develop or gather strategic resources in every domain of their business 


-  Ordinary resources are  cheap and necessary way to leverage unique assets  and thus allow replication and scalability 


-  ,  In particular ,  the use of ordinary resources enables the duplication of  business model in many business units and/or in many countries 


-  If such replication is  key success factor ,  as it is in industries such as retailing , 20 extending  business model through the acquisition of ordinary resources is much easier  and much cheaper  than implementing  business model relying on unique assets 


-  ,  For instance McDonalds Corporation is the worlds largest chain of fast-food restaurants ,  with more than 36 , 000 restaurants in more than 100 countries 


-  It has achieved this impressive growth in only 60 years 


-  While  top brand ,  efficient processes and premium locations for restaurants are often seen as the main strategic resources of the company ,  the replication of McDonalds business model is only possible because the model leverages relatively ordinary resources ,  in the form of more than  


-  Millions of young adults worldwide got their first entry-level job with the company ,  helping to keep wage bills down 


-  Far from being the talented human resources described in human resource management books ,  most entry-level McDonalds employees are not highly qualified ,  are part-time workers and can be easily replaced 


-  While scalability  ( the ability of  business to grow and develop without major organizational barriers )  may be related to cultural and cognitive dimensions , 21 it also depends on the type of resources on which the business builds 


-  When they are used to leverage strategic resources ,  ordinary resources allow scalability 


-  ,  Ordinary resources  not just unique ones  can yield strategic benefits and eventually become the basis of competitive advantage 


- 22 They can play  central role in the emergence of new business models 


-  )  This evolution may give rise to drastic changes in the competitive landscape in  given industry and eventually lead to the emergence of new markets 


-  For instance ,  the creation of the low-cost business model in the airline industry by Southwest Airlines in the early 1970s is sometimes explained by  unique blend of operational constraints and entrepreneurial ingenuity 


-  However ,  it also derived from the fact that Southwest Airlines was endowed with relatively ordinary resources  ( access to small regional airports ,  old airplanes and  comparatively inexperienced workforce )  while it was lacking what were perceived at that time as strategic assets  ( hub airports ,  connections ,  diversified fleet of airplanes ,  etc 


- 23 As the example of Southwest illustrates ,  it is possible to develop extraordinary performance and to gain competitive advantage by combining and leveraging ordinary resources in new ways 


-  ,  Crowdsourcing and crowdfunding strategies are two new types of business models based on the development of  mass of ordinary resources 


-  The ability to leverage massive amounts of comparatively ordinary talents and trivial assets through  platform and its ecosystem is not only  game changer ,  it questions the very principles of by-the-book strategies 


- 24 For example ,  the sharing of small units of available resources by the crowd is  successful business model for the crowdfunding company Kickstarter 


-  The concept of Kickstarter ,  where potential investors can invest as little as $1 to finance innovative projects ,  has created an industry of its own ,  and many competitors are jumping on the bandwagon 


-  In this model ,  it is  crowd of people ,  their abundant little pennies and an ample number of competing projects that yield success  not unique assets ,  high fixed costs and unparalleled talents 


-  This collaborative platform has developed  unique value proposition: to transform good ideas into ready-to-market products 


-  If Quirky brings  product to market ,  the inventor of the idea and the community members who contributed to its development  called influencers  receive royalties based on product sales 


-  ,  Examples like Kickstarter and Quirky indicate that strategic success can derive from  platform that draws on an abundance of ordinary resources 


-  This suggests that ,  instead of only focusing on unique resources ,  executives should also focus on leveraging  vast supply of more mundane talents 


-  ( See Can You Leverage Ordinary Resources? )  As physicist and Nobel laureate Philip Anderson wrote in 1972 ,  More is different: Beyond  certain size ,   system is endowed with new capabilities that significantly differ from what its various constituents can offer 


- 26 In business ,  the traditional strategic paradigm ,  based on the tight ownership of competitive-advantage generating assets ,  loses its significance when the wisdom of millions of people are involved ,  when ordinary resources are combined to achieve extraordinary performance 


-  Here are the critical points of the more is different pattern in business: ,   


-  Platform business models harness the hidden value of ordinary resources 


-  In their benchmarking processes ,  companies focus on new capabilities and new resources ,  but they do not investigate the potential value creation from ordinary resources ,  existing knowledge and ordinary talents 


-  However ,  our examples show that innovative entrepreneurs can develop new services from  mass of ordinary resources 


-  The main challenge consists in developing and growing an attractive platform  which in that case is  true strategic resource  in order to capture scattered ordinary assets and talents 


-  It is the combination of the platform and the mass of ordinary resources that create sustained competitive advantage 


-  However ,  as  strategic resource ,  the platform bears all the risks we highlight: Exploiting  vast amount of data ,  people or initiatives can be costly; rare talents can capture value; protecting the platform can hinder innovation; and  focus on the platform as an asset can limit executives perspectives 


-  ,  According to author Chris Andersons famous long tail concept ,  it is time companies stop focusing so much of their marketing efforts on flagship products to the detriment of more ordinary ones 


- 27 We make  similar observation about the resources portfolio: Businesses should consider the long tail of resources and stop analyzing their resources portfolio primarily through the prism of uniqueness and scarcity 


-  Whats more ,  taking into account the implications of ordinary resources opens new business perspectives 


-  Acquiring and mastering unique resources undoubtedly yields competitive advantage ,  but it can be extremely costly ,  and building barriers to imitation can erode your future competitive advantage 


-  Focusing on unique strengths implies specialization ,  and if you try to become  one-trick pony ,  sooner or later the trick will be matched by competitors 


-  Innovations can undermine the market value of  portfolio of superior assets 


-  By focusing on securing unique resources ,  executives may jeopardize the agility of their business and their ability to sustain  competitive advantage 


-  For instance ,  consider how the Wikipedia anonymous crowd ,  with its improvised bricolage ,  outperformed Microsoft Encarta and its deliberately crafted strategy 


-  ,  By eroding established barriers to imitation ,  ordinary resource-based business models may disrupt the business landscape 


-  Instead of promoting secrecy and defending industrial property rights at all costs ,  powerful incumbents should reconsider the advantages their distinctive assets provide and contest the taken-for-granted assumptions that underlie their success 


-  Overconfidence and inertia lurk in the blind spot of some resource-based strategies ,  whereas frugal innovation and crowdsourcing-based approaches are gaining increasing attention 


-  Rapidly expanding platform business models raise questions about this bias ,  and it is time executives start exploiting the long tail of resources 


- The turmoil of business competition has often been likened to  stormy sea 


-  In the mid-1990s ,  the winds of change appeared especially powerful ,  threatening even some of the strongest businesses 


-  Christensen ,   professor at Harvard Business School who is now considered one of the worlds leading experts on innovation and growth 


-  Good managers face  dilemma ,  he argued ,  because by doing the very things they need to do to succeed  listen to customers ,  invest in the business ,  and build distinctive capabilities  they run the risk of ignoring rivals with disruptive innovations 


-  ,  Christensens theory of disruptive innovation has gripped the business consciousness like few other ideas 


-  In  review of enduring business books ,  The Economist called the theory one of the most influential modern business ideas 


-  The theorys influence has spread far beyond the business world 


-  Christensen and his associates have proposed disruption as  framework for thinking about vexing social problems such as poverty ,  lack of access to health care ,  illiteracy ,  and unemployment 


-  The theory ,  or variations thereof ,  has been used in so many settings that Christensen himself has expressed unease with some of the ways the theory is being applied 


-  So ,  what is the right way to use the theory of disruptive innovation? What are its core elements ,  and how predictive is it? We decided to examine these questions by taking  closer look at the theory 


-  ,  Our first discovery was that ,  despite the theorys widespread use and appeal ,  its essential validity and generalizability have been seldom tested in the academic literature 


-  Christensens initial research ,  which formed the kernel of the theory ,  was based mainly on the hard disk drive industry in the 1970s and 1980s 


-  He then published  few peer-reviewed articles on the industry 


-  Other scholars have published discussions of related case examples  ( notably about Polaroid Corp 


-  ,  Smith Corona ,  and the disk drive industry )  , 10 but few quantitative tests have been performed 


- 11 The ones that have been published fail to provide confirmatory evidence for the theory ,  suggesting instead that full-blown disruptions of the type that Christensen describes are rare and that most managers respond effectively to potentially disruptive threats 


- 13 More nuanced case analysis ,  he argues ,  shows that the theory of disruptive innovation explains the failure of leading businesses ,  time after time and industry after industry 


-  ,  Spurred on by this argument ,  we decided that to understand how to apply the theory of disruptive innovation ,  we needed to delve into the case histories of dozens of disruptions identified by Christensen and his coauthor ,  Michael  


- 14 In order to examine the numerous examples and appreciate their nuances ,  we surveyed and interviewed one or more experts on each of 77 cases discussed in The Innovators Dilemma and The Innovators Solution ,  where Christensen and Raynor lay out the elements of the theory 


-  )  ,  After interviewing experts on each case ,  we had  further discovery: Many of the theorys exemplary cases did not fit four of its key conditions and predictions well 


-   handful corresponded well with all four elements  ( notably ,  for example ,  the disruptions by Salesforce 


-  However ,   majority of the 77 cases were found to include different motivating forces or displayed unpredicted outcomes 


-  Among them were cases involving legacy costs ,  the effect of numerous competitors ,  changing economies of scale ,  and shifting social conditions 


-  Discussions with our industry experts also helped us to identify the most generally applicable elements of the theory of disruptive innovation as well as to define other ways managers can guide businesses through stormy times 


-  ,  Before surveying and interviewing experts on each of the 77 cases ,  we identified four key elements of the theory of disruption:  (  )  that incumbents in  market are improving along  trajectory of sustaining innovation ,  (  )  that they overshoot customer needs ,  (  )  that they possess the capability to respond to disruptive threats ,  and  (  )  that incumbents end up floundering as  result of the disruption 


-  ,  In The Innovators Solution ,  Christensen and Raynor argue that one of the key elements of disruptive innovation is that in every market there is  distinctly different trajectory of improvement that innovating companies provide as they introduce new and improved products 


- 16 An incumbent businesss improvement trajectory results from what they call sustaining innovation  the year-by-year improvements that all good companies grind out 


-  For example ,  auto companies might continue improving the horsepower or torque of their engines 


-  As Christensen and Raynor explain ,  good managers strive to make better products that they can sell for higher profit margins to not-yet-satisfied customers in more demanding tiers of the market 


- 18 ,   second element of Christensen and Raynors theory is that the pace of sustaining innovation along the trajectory of particular value propositions almost always outstrips the ability of customers in any given tier of the market to use it 


-   Thus ,   company whose products are squarely positioned on mainstream customers current needs will probably overshoot what those customers are able to utilize in the future 


- 19 To illustrate their point ,  Christensen and Raynor use an example from the 1983 computer industry ,  when people first started using personal computers for word processing 


-   But todays processors offer much more speed than mainstream customers can use 


- 20 ,  Christensen and Raynor claim that incumbent companies frequently possess the capabilities needed to succeed ,  but managers fail to employ them effectively to combat potential disruptors 


- 21 Disruption has  paralyzing effect on industry leaders ,  they write 


- 22 Competitors with disruptive innovations lull incumbent companies into complacency by avoiding  head-to-head competition for the incumbents best customers 


-  They target instead new and low-end customers ,  Christensen and Raynor note ,  with products and services that are not as good as [those] currently available 


-  Because an incumbent companys existing activities determine its perceptions of the economic value of an innovation [and] shape the rewards and threats ,  Christensen and Raynor argue ,  managers fail to appreciate and address the potential threat 


- 24 If the disruption appears in  new market ,  incumbent businesses ignore the attackers; if among low-end customers ,  they flee the attack 


- 26 He does not specify the exact probability of failure ,  but he leaves little doubt it is very high 


-  Performance oversupply ,  he writes in The Innovators Dilemma ,  opens the door for simpler ,  less expensive ,  and more convenient  and almost always disruptive  technologies to enter 


- 27 Companies with these disruptive technologies ,  he writes ,  will always improve their products performance and in so doing eventually take over the older markets 


- 28 Once the disruptive product gains  foothold in new or low-end markets ,  Christensen and Raynor write ,  the disruptors are on  path that will ultimately crush the incumbents 


- 29 ,  We intentionally did not mention disruptive innovation until the end of our discussions with experts in order to elicit unbiased responses 


-  For many of the cases ,  experts reported historical evidence that corresponded with some elements of the theory 


-  For example ,  consistent with Christensen and Raynors claim that managers tend to ignore low-end disruption ,  an author of  book on the history of book retailing told us that higher-end bookstores had initially discounted the threat of mall-based stores 


- 31 In many other interviews ,  however ,  the experts pointed out noteworthy discrepancies between case facts and elements of the theory 


-  ,  In 24 cases  ( 31% of the total )  ,  our experts were skeptical of the existence of any meaningful trajectory of sustaining innovation prior to the emergence of  presumably disruptive innovation  ( for instance ,  market retailing before department stores ,  bazaars before eBay ,  and four-year colleges before community colleges )  


- 32 The case of large-scale meatpacking provides  good example of such an exception 


- 34 To the contrary ,  they relied on tools and artisanal practices that hadnt changed for decades 


-  Local slaughter operations were replaced ,  the experts argued ,  because of broader changes: the Union Armys demand for beef during the American Civil War ,  the expansion of the railroads ,  the scale economies provided by the use of  disassembly line , 35 and opposition by local communities that wished to see noxious slaughter operations closed 


- 36 ,  In 60 cases  ( 78% of the total )  ,  and contrary to the expectations of the theory ,  our experts thought that incumbent companies were not producing ,  or likely to produce ,  products or services that exceeded customer needs 


-  For example ,  hand animation was replaced by computer animation not because it outstripped what customers wanted ,  but because it was too expensive 


-  In the case of local area networks ,  data rates increased rapidly ,  but customers kept pace by developing ways to use the increased bandwidth 


-  In the cases of Internet search engines replacement of print directories ,  two professors at top-ranked business schools were skeptical that print directories such as the Yellow Pages had surpassed anyones needs 


- 37 Rather ,  the print directories were displaced ,  one expert noted ,  because companies producing them simply didnt have the ability to respond: There are certain situations where the economics  just dont let reasonable managers respond in  way that would disrupt the disruptor 


- 38 In other cases ,  experts noted that overshoot was difficult to achieve 


-  For example ,  when discussing whether surgery had overshot customer needs ,  thereby enabling disruption by endoscopy ,  an  


-  and expert on the business of health care asked ,  What would such overshoot look like: too little risk of death?39 ,  Prior to initiating our study ,  we anticipated that overshoot would be common in cases involving the computing industry ,  such as computer software or hardware 


-  But our experts  ( made up of computer scientists ,  historians ,  and business professors )  suggested that even here overshoot was infrequent 


- 40 They acknowledged rapid growth in computing power driven by Moores law  ( the observation by former Intel cofounder Gordon  


-  Moore that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years )  


-  But they were doubtful that this led to neglect of average or low-end consumers 


-  Incumbent companies ,  one expert noted ,  often use computing power to serve the needs of new ,  less-savvy customers  not to overshoot customer needs 


-  ,  for example ,  launched its original Macintosh in 1984 with  powerful central processing unit to enable  user-friendly graphical interface 


-  ,  In 30 cases  ( 39% of the total )  ,  our experts disputed Christensens contention that incumbent businesses were capable of responding to the disruptive innovation 


-  In some cases ,  experts argued ,  incumbents were restricted ,  even barred ,  from using their capabilities to respond 


-  For example ,  in legal education ,  Christensen points to the weak response of incumbent law schools to online legal training 


-  But there are clear limits to how far incumbent law schools can go in exploring potentially disruptive online legal education 


-  In the United States ,  the American Bar Association restricts the number of hours of online courses law schools can offer without losing their accreditation and jeopardizing the ability of their graduates to take the bar exam 


-  airlines were restricted from competing on price 


- 43 ,  In other cases ,  our experts doubted that incumbent organizations possessed the capabilities needed to compete with  disruptive entrant 


-  Christensen and Raynor imply that national postal services  ( for example ,  the  


-  by offering their own email services 


- 44 However ,  an expert was skeptical about the practicality of this plan ,  pointing out that ,  for the most part ,  executives running the postal services had very little control over labor practices and price structures 


-   similar argument can be made concerning the wood-products industry ,  many of whose products have been disrupted by plastics 


-  However ,   professor at  leading engineering school told us it was unreasonable to assume that companies with skills in silviculture and sawmill technology had the capability to compete effectively against disrupting producers of plastics 


- 46 ,  Christensen says that disruptive innovators displace incumbent leaders nearly every time 


-  They agreed that in about 62% of the cases ,  incumbents floundered as  result of  disruptive competitor 


-  However ,  in the remaining 29 cases  ( 38% )  ,  there were  range of outcomes 


-  In some cases  ( for example ,  credit scoring and business lending )  , 47 disruptions complemented incumbent businesses by supporting their existing actions 


-  In other cases ,  disruptions coexisted with incumbent businesses or allowed them to reach untapped customers  ( for instance ,  catalog sales and department stores )  


-  In still others ,  disruptions have continued to serve different markets  ( for example ,  physical and online law schools )  


- 48 ,  In summary ,  although Christensen and Raynor selected the 77 cases as examples of the theory of disruptive innovation ,  our survey of experts reveals that many of the cases do not correspond closely with the theory 


-  In fact ,  their responses suggest that only seven of the cases  ( 9% )  contained all four elements of the theory that we asked about 


-  ( See How Well Do the Cases Match the Theory? )  How can we account for this discrepancy? Clearly ,  analysis of the cases is open to interpretation ,  and one or more of our experts may be mistaken in their judgment of  particular case 


-  But even several random errors ,  given the large number of experts surveyed ,  would not significantly change our main findings 


-  ,  We concluded each of our interviews by disclosing the subject of our study and asking the expert to reflect on the theorys usefulness in understanding the case at hand 


-  ,  Some of our experts noted confusion about the presumed goal of  business or organization 


-  Christensens early work seems to imply that companies should try to maintain market share 


-  Experts familiar with this work noted that such an assumption could lead to strategies that maintained market share while harming profits 


-  In response to such criticism , 49 Christensen clarified his position in  2006 publication ,  writing that he had simply assumed that the objective function of management should be to maximize shareholder value 


- 50 This clarified objective is problematic for the 9% of cases we examined that represent nonprofit organizations or publicly regulated utilities 


-  For example ,  an author and expert on higher education noted that the access mission of community colleges often runs counter to what presidents or other leaders might do to cut costs or improve completion outcomes 


-  This expert adds: That makes it not such  great example for the theory [because] as  mission-driven institution ,  they are responsible to the public and  higher calling 


-  As described by Christensen and Raynor ,  the theory assumes that in almost every industry ,  sustaining innovation outstrips the ability of customers in any given tier of the market to use it 


- 52 The resulting overshoot of what customers can utilize ,  they write ,  opens the door for  disruptive innovation 


- 53 Many of our experts identified problems with this assumption 


-  ,  Sustaining innovation can be too slow to keep up with growing customer needs 


-  For example ,  new improvements in wood materials failed to keep pace with growing construction requirements 


-  Likewise ,  even with the development of new processing technologies ,  many postal services failed to satisfy growing customer demands for speedy home delivery 


-  In addition ,  customer needs often respond to better performance ,  altering behavior and ,  in turn ,  ones perception of needs 


-  Today ,  for example ,  many of us feel we need to carry around what are in effect supercomputers that take pictures and allow us to chat with our friends 


- 54 In some cases ,  one expert pointed out to us ,  user needs seem to be insatiable 


- 55 What would it mean ,  she asked ,  if food was too healthy ,  shelter too available ,  or education too effective? ,  When both disruptive and sustaining innovations compete to satisfy ever-increasing customer demands ,  the relative rate of improvement may be important 


-  Our experts noted several cases where disruptive innovation had sputtered or where older technologies had improved so quickly that new technologies were eclipsed 


-  For example ,  in 2003 ,  Christensen and Raynor predicted that ultrasound technology would disrupt radiation imaging 


-  Innovations in radiation imaging  ( for instance ,  X-ray tomography )  ,  followed by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging  ( MRI )  ,  have relegated the use of ultrasound to specialized applications such as prenatal care 


- 57 ,  Indeed ,  the assumption that disruptive innovations always beat sustaining ones has led Christensen to make  number of erroneous predictions 


-  For example ,  in an early publication ,  Christensen and Joseph  


- 5-inch format would be displaced by new competitors 


- 58 When Gary Marks ,  then vice president for disk drive marketing at hard drive manufacturer Conner Peripherals ,  publicly disagreed ,  Christensen and Bower replied that Marks was making exactly the mistake we warn against 


- 5-inch disk drives dominate the industry ,  and  


-  ,  Joseph Schumpeter argued that waves of creative destruction were  vital part of any economy because they washed away businesses with obsolete capabilities 


-  By contrast ,  Christensen argues that leading companies often have the resources and abilities needed to succeed but lack the values ,  modes of interaction ,  and decision making to do so 


- 60 However ,  such confidence is belied by the trials encountered by many of the 77 cases we studied 


-  Several of the companies had to navigate fundamental transitions in technology  ( for example ,  from flat-glass to roll-film photography ,  or travel agents to online services )  ,  and others had to make the difficult transition from analog to digital technologies  ( for instance ,  from vacuum tubes to liquid crystal displays ,  physical mail to email ,  hand drawing to digital animation )  


- 61 ,  Christensen and his collaborators argue that managers are doing an excellent job satisfying their high-margin customers in their existing business but are myopic about the threats posed by low-end customers or new markets 


-  In fact ,  in several of the cases we examined ,  poor management left even high-end customers dissatisfied 


-  For example ,  by the time Honda Motor Co 


-  entered the United States with  line of inexpensive offerings for the  


-  motorcycle market ,  Harley-Davidson Motor Co 


-  was already being criticized by some of its customers for poor reliability 


-  ,  Christensen assumes that managers are myopic when it comes to making good choices about new markets created by disruptive innovations 


-  His own research and that of others showed that most managers made choices that were aligned with their capabilities 


-  Businesses with the capabilities needed to compete tended to adopt disruptive innovations 


-  Weaker businesses tended to play out their hands by maximizing their returns in declining existing markets 


-  On average ,  he said ,  managers make the right choices 


- 64 ,  In several cases ,  the right choice for an incumbent may have been to avoid competing with  disruptive innovation 


-  Speaking of the airline industry ,  for example ,  one expert said ,  The biggest contrast between the Christensen model and what happened with the airlines is that [Christensen says] the barrier is somehow cognitive 


- 65 Switching to  low-cost ,  point-to-point airline business model would have required  dramatically different fleet of airplanes ,  new workers ,  new airports ,  and new gates 


-  Sometimes [stuff] happens ,  he argued ,  and the best response is to adapt but not dramatically change the business model 


- 66  business professor and expert on digital electronics made  similar point about the transition from television tubes to digital displays 


- s losses in the display market and argued that managers should have recognized their lack of advantages and prepared to exit rather than fighting to defend Sonys position 


- 67 ,  Is there  better explanation than the theory of disruption for the patterns of success and failure across the 77 cases Christensen and Raynor cite? Having argued that one theory is not adequate for explaining so many diverse cases ,  we are cautious about overreaching 


-  Nevertheless ,  from our conversations with academics and industry experts ,  we have identified some rough patterns that could provide  starting point 


-  These patterns revolve around legacy costs ,  changing scale economies ,  and the laws of probability 


-  For example ,   


-  steel company managers ,  protected from foreign competition by trade legislation ,  agreed to labor contracts that included expensive health care and pension provisions 


-  ,  Fortune writer Carol Loomis explained the deadly spiral as a demographic nightmare ,  in which an ever-shrinking number of active employees were charged with making profits sufficient to support the present and future of an ever-growing number of retirees and dependents 


- 69 Our experts told us that such legacy costs played  similarly critical role in several other cases ,  including automobiles ,  motorcycles ,  food processing ,  and transportation 


- 70 ,  In at least 40% of the 77 cases ,  changing business conditions increased the economic advantages of scale and thereby limited the number of businesses that could profitably serve the market 


-  The resulting disruption was really  well-known economic process that selected for  few well-placed businesses ,  incumbents and entrants alike ,  that could best leverage scale economies 


-  For example ,  we mentioned earlier that the expansion of national railroads allowed  few meatpacking plants to harness economies of scale and drive down costs 


-  Previously ,  such scale advantages had been constrained by the inability to ship meat long distances ,  but the expansion of railroads and the availability of railcars with ice removed these barriers 


-  Before the tremendous growth of e-commerce ,  Borders Group Inc 


-  leveraged economies created by the superstore format to gain  competitive advantage over smaller bookstores and mall-based chains 


-  Because online sales costs continually fell with volume ,  whoever gained an initial advantage was likely to take the entire market; it didnt matter whether it was  startup or an incumbent 


-  Changing scale economies turned legacy investments in superstores into  liability 


-  business school told us ,  [T]he problem for Borders was that they needed all of their customers ,  and so when Amazon started to siphon them off they simply couldnt cover fixed costs 


- 73 ,  When network externalities provide  broad scale advantage ,  some businesses are faced with  winner-take-all competition 


-  Brian Arthur has demonstrated that in such competitions ,   few early sales can initiate  feedback loop of network advantage that tips all customers to one supplier 


- 75 To gain future scale economies ,  customers joined the DOS standard ,  further entrenching Microsofts position 


-  Eventually ,  the scale benefits became so great that even superior operating systems such as Apples MacOS could not gain significant market share 


-  ,  Sometimes incumbents are simply outnumbered by the sheer quantity of new competitors 


-  In at least 30% of the 77 cases we considered ,  new infrastructure and changing demographics caused an expansion of business opportunities and  gold rush search for the best business models 


-  Because of their numbers ,  however ,  new entrants were able to cover more ground in the aggregate 


-  The laws of probability thus said that in most cases new entrants would stake the best claims and be the biggest winners 


-  ,  For example ,  the construction of highways following World War II greatly stimulated the development of roadside America 


- 76 New forms of service franchising inspired hundreds of food service chains to enter the market with different offerings and business models 


- 77 So many investors rushed in that speculators even created financial instruments for investing in franchise models 


-  Although many of the old chains  ( such as Howard Johnsons and Dairy Queen )  managed to survive ,  some of the new companies  ( such as McDonalds and Burger King )  proved to have selected better franchise models and eventually emerged as the biggest winners 


-  Because online business required little investment in physical assets ,  almost anyone could start an online company 


-  Existing businesses once again explored promising new business models ,  but because they were fewer in number ,  they couldnt stake as many claims as the swarms of entrepreneurs 


-  Although the majority of online startups would ultimately fail ,  their sheer numbers meant that some of them would strike it rich 


-  Instead ,  managers need to evaluate difficult problems from  number of different perspectives 


-  Rather ,  we recommend using its best parts in addition to classical approaches to strategic analysis 


-  Many of our experts noted examples of managers who overlooked or misunderstood the importance of an emerging threat 


-   professor of business innovation told us ,  for example ,  that managers working in relationship management software had overlooked the threat posed by Salesforce 


-  In many other cases ,  managers in incumbent companies misunderstood the value of innovations by rivals 


-  Later ,  according to an industry historian who has chronicled this story ,  they all slapped their foreheads  and said ,  Oh man ,  we really screwed up back then 


- 79 Similarly ,  although managers at Xerox didnt completely neglect the market for self-service copiers ,  they do seem to have misunderstood the value of Canons dry-toner innovation in reducing service costs and customer inconvenience 


-  Christensens theory was inspired by an industry that he admits is highly unusual; as he wrote ,  nowhere in the history of business has there been an industry like disk drives ,  where changes in technology ,  market structure ,  global scope ,  and vertical integration have been so pervasive ,  rapid ,  and unrelenting 


-  He suggests that few other industries offer researchers the same opportunities for developing theories 


- 81 Perhaps so ,  but the theorys unusual birthplace suggests the need for an evaluation of similarities between the disk drive industry and any setting where theory is to be applied 


-  One business school professor told us ,  Here is what  tell my students who label everything  disruption 


-  Where is the improvement curve? Because the fundamental assumption of the theory is that the improvement curve [the rate of sustaining innovation by incumbents] is going up faster than the consumers ability to absorb those improvements 


- 82 This assumption is critical ,  the professor explained ,  because it drives vital parts of the theory of disruption ,  such as the expectation that disruptive threats will emerge among low-end ,  overserved customers 


-  ,  Even when there is  rapid improvement curve and potential for the improvement to exceed customer needs ,  the theory of disruptive innovation should be considered  warning rather than  prediction 


-  The theory describes case examples of dysfunction and failure ,  not what the average business may do 


-  For example ,  an expert in  top-rated technical school told us that his research on the disk drive industry suggested that the case of one disk drive company ,  Seagate Technology Inc 


- 5-inch disk drives ,  and as  result ,  it was temporarily displaced from leadership in the industry 


-  Yet most of the time ,  Seagate and other companies responded effectively to presumably disruptive threats 


- 83 Thus ,  the theory provides  good reminder of potential pitfalls ,  he argued ,  but in no way does it predict what most companies will do 


-  ,   telling example of how risky it can be to use the theory to predict the behaviors of incumbent companies can be found in  teaching case ,  coauthored by Christensen himself ,  describing  startup company with an idea for developing  very thin camera 


-  The companys management knew it could not compete with established companies if they chose to make  similar product 


-  However ,  management hoped that the disruptive nature of the companys credit card camera would cause big players to ignore them 


-  Unfortunately ,  an established competitor noticed the product and jumped into the market with  superior offering 


- 84 Contrary to what the theory predicted ,  the startup ,  not the incumbent ,  was driven from the market 


-  ,  Given the evidence that the theory has limited predictive power ,  how should managers react to the appearance of potential new rivals? We propose  fairly straightforward diagnostic based on authenticated modes of analysis 


-  Second ,  they should find ways to leverage existing capabilities 


-  ,  Christensen and his collaborators seem to assume that no matter what industry or market  company is in ,  it should fight to maintain control 


-  In many of the 77 cases ,  factors such as low barriers to entry ,  the emergence of substitutes ,  and an increase in the number and aggressiveness of rivals turned once-profitable industries into profitless deserts 


-  Indeed ,  choosing to fight without studying the options violates  basic principle of strategy: The first step in responding to any major innovation is assessing whether the industry continues to be an attractive place to compete 


-  When industries become structurally unattractive ,  it may be time to plan an organized retreat 


-  Shih has studied the challenges that businesses with analog technologies faced in responding to new digital technologies 


-  Such transitions are competency-destroying ,  he writes ,  because the capabilities ,  tacit knowledge ,  and experience base of the incumbent analog firms are rendered irrelevant 


-  As  result ,  Shih argues ,  companies should evaluate the potential for profits in  new market before they jump in 


- 87 If current capabilities can be used or extended ,  it may make sense to expand into  new market 


-  ,  for example ,  expanded from books to other vertical markets where it was able to command some advantage from online sales 


-  However ,  companies need to pay attention to the potential synergies between existing and new businesses 


-  ,  Sometimes choosing the right way to use capabilities means reconsidering the existing identity of the organization 


- 88 Consider the case of Eastman Kodak Co 


-  According to popular opinion ,  Kodak failed because it didnt move aggressively and effectively enough into digital imaging 


-  ,  according to this view ,  succeeded because it developed  successful line of digital cameras 


-  However ,  the reality is that this version of the story is  myth 


-  Fujifilm survived not because it developed  new line of digital cameras but because it used its capabilities in chemicals and information technology to develop successful products and services in coatings ,  cosmetics ,  and document processing 


-  Fujifilm continues to make  few cameras ,  but it barely recoups its operating costs 


- 89 It is prospering not because it defended its position in imaging ,  but because it expanded into other areas 


-  ,  The prospect of an entrepreneur with new technology potentially disrupting incumbent businesses can make managers wary of cooperating with entrants 


-  In several of the cases we explored ,  however ,  incumbents recognized the potential for working with new entrants 


-  ,  for example ,  responded to the emergence of computer animation by cooperating with and eventually acquiring Pixar Animation Studios 


-  Disney could have continued to compete with Pixar and tried to drive it from the market ,  but Disney managers wisely recognized that their companys strengths were in marketing ,  distribution ,  and creating positive experiences at parks ,  cruise ships ,  and resorts; Pixar ,  by contrast ,  was  content developer 


- 90 Many pharmaceutical companies routinely use  range of approaches ,  including cooperation ,  when facing competition from biotech startups 


-  Rather than seeing every biotech company as  potential disrupter ,  pharmaceutical company executives often cooperate with biotech startups to leverage their own strengths 


-  ,  There is nothing radical about employing such classic approaches to strategic analysis 


- 91 But doing so is an excellent way to cede your businesss competitive advantage to more competent competitors 


-  High-level theories can give managers encouragement ,  but they are no replacement for careful analysis and difficult choices 


-  Should  company stay in the fight in  particular market and incur the cost of doing so ,  or should it exit the market and see those revenues vanish? Should  company invest in  profitable but declining business ,  or should it turn away? Is the best course to maximize returns by letting the business slowly die? These are heart-wrenching choices 


-  Following simple theories or using quick analogies may provide  sense of certainty ,  but they are no substitutes for careful ,  fundamental analysis of the nature of competition and the sources of competitive advantage
