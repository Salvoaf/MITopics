- How are we going to pay for this? ,  In that question lies the conundrum faced by the growing ranks of corporate leaders who recognize that business must ,  at the very least ,  stop contributing to the most urgent problems facing humanity and ought to ,  at best ,  help solve them 


-  In mission statements and strategic plans ,  many companies are making commitments to improving sustainability and reducing inequity  but when it comes to meeting those goals ,  they are tripped up by the financial implications 


-  ,  In reality ,  we have no shortage of ideas on how to provide greater and more equitable access to goods and services ,  use them conscientiously and more effectively ,  and leave the least amount of waste behind 


-  But we are frequently held back in implementing those ideas because of the presumption that any sustainability initiative invariably leads to higher costs ,  higher taxes ,  higher fiscal deficits ,  and ,  ultimately ,  higher prices 


-  How are we going to pay for this? becomes  killer question seemingly designed to stifle progress 


-  ,  Overlooked in the debate ,  however ,  is one factor that unnecessarily limits the scope that leaders in all spheres  whether business ,  politics ,  or nonprofit  need to implement solutions that can scale to meaningful impact 


-  ,  That factor is the price mechanism 


-  We contend that its possible to find creative solutions that rally all market actors around responsible behaviors that mitigate the negative externalities of commerce before businesses tally them up and price them in 


-  In one sense ,  we argue that organizations act more as caretakers of markets than as simple producers ,  using the incentives and information embedded in the price mechanism to allocate the responsibility for broader and fairer access ,  for conscientious and effective consumption ,  and for handling waste more efficiently 


-  ,  At the root of the problem is the premise that the only way companies can ease the burden of commerce on our society is to account for it properly and find someone to foot the bill 


-  This premise corners businesses into what we call  taboo trade-off 


-   company can try to pass the incremental cost of environmentally or socially responsible practices onto customers ,  but they may not be willing or able to pay it and thus flee to cheaper competitors or leave the market entirely 


-  Alternatively ,  the company can absorb this cost by sacrificing margin ,  cutting corners on quality ,  or making the supply chain sweat until the economics work out 


-  In each case ,  the financial or reputational risk is such that the organization often sees Do nothing as the pragmatic solution 


-  It dodges the trade-off instead of addressing it 


-  ,  This conundrum is particularly frustrating for leaders who are committed to driving change 


-  Emmanuel Faber led Frances Danone for over six years and was widely seen as  prominent advocate for  more responsible capitalism that serves not only shareholders but also the environment ,  employees ,  and suppliers 


-  But in March 2021 ,  Faber lost his job as chairman and CEO after activist shareholders voiced their displeasure with Danones financial performance ,  strategy ,  and governance 


-  ,  The dismissal of someone like Faber reflects an undercurrent of skepticism that still simmers behind the scenes at purpose-oriented businesses 


-  One CEO of  European multinational reportedly said that if he made his companys environmental policy greener ,  my profit margin would fall 3% per year ,  my stock price would fall 15% ,  and  would get fired 


-  Indeed ,   recent study indicates that CEOs who enact greener or more sustainable policies are significantly more likely to get fired for poor performance than CEOs who do not 


-  ,  The good news is that leaders have far more leeway with the price mechanism than they realize 


-  This quickly becomes apparent when they stop thinking that How are we going to pay for this? is the only question and Price in the externalities is its only answer 


-  In fact ,  every price decision builds on the answers to three basic questions: ,  Most businesses take these questions for granted and believe the answers to be moot and immutable 


-  ,  Rethinking what customers pay for matters because it determines the extent to which organizations generate revenue by delivering outcomes that customers desire rather than providing them with inputs  ( products and services )  


-  Finally ,  make and sell transfers ownership  and therefore the burden of disposal  from suppliers to customers who may not have the drive or expertise to dispose of goods responsibly 


-  ,  Today ,   host of novel commercial arrangements  such as subscriptions and memberships ,  pay-as-you-go models ,  collaborative consumption ,  revenue-sharing agreements ,  and performance-based contracting  can address these challenges without transferring ownership 


-  Each of these alternatives can ease the access problem inherent in traditional transactions ,  because companies earn their revenue only when they provide customers with direct ,  unencumbered access to their offerings 


-  Similarly ,  pay-as-you-go and sharing approaches encourage sensible consumption because customers pay at each consumption episode ,  and performance-based contracts ensure that companies get paid only when they deliver value ,  not when they promise it 


-  ,  As they consider who pays ,  business leaders need to question whether it makes sense for all customers to pay the same price ,  or even to pay at all 


-  But whenever universal access is the target in  sector ,  businesses should consider varying prices based on peoples ability or willingness to pay or ,  in the case of third-party payers ,  the value that an individual end user derives 


-  ,  In certain situations ,  companies might think in terms of interconnected currencies such that customers might pay to satisfy their own basic needs in something other than money 


-  The reduction in carbon emissions resulting from the decreased use of wood fires has  monetary value on the carbon market ,  and this can be used to fund the enterprise 


-  ,  Likewise ,  in some sectors ,  certain behaviors are clearly desirable from  social or environmental perspective ,  such as purchasing soon-to-expire food to avoid waste or participating in physical activity to improve ones health 


-  In those cases ,  businesses should consider varying prices not based on customers ability or willingness to pay ,  but based on their readiness to act responsibly 


-  ,  Companies should likewise reconsider when and how to collect payment 


-  They can turn to micropayments to allow more granular access 


-  If reasonable ,  they can also defer payments to ease the financial burden on customers or ,  importantly ,  to better align the timing of costs and benefits 


-  Finally ,  one can think creatively about payment as an opportunity to engage people 


-  ,  In the rest of this article ,  we show how  broader ,  more creative take on these three questions can alleviate the taboo trade-off and accelerate progress 


-  ,  The battle to mitigate the effects of climate change is widely seen as  race against time 


-  ,  Making progress against this ticking clock requires  multitude of solutions aimed at improving equitable access to renewable energy sources ,  combined with more conscientious consumption 


-  The circumstances and challenges vary greatly from market to market ,  but one common denominator is that traditional views on the price mechanism create  taboo trade-off that hinders the adoption of cleaner solutions 


-  How can the energy sector transition from  profitable carbon-based market to one that is equally profitable but greener? ,  One of the biggest obstacles inhibiting the adoption of solar energy among households is the upfront investment required to install solar panels 


-  In developed countries ,   residential installation can cost tens of thousands of dollars ,  even though the price per watt for photovoltaic  ( PV )  panels dropped by almost 80% between 2010 and 2020 


-  After making this investment ,  homeowners must wait many years to break even and start to enjoy the financial benefits that solar energy provides 


-  The discrepancy between the timing of payments and onset of cost savings is so large that no reasonable price concession can bridge it satisfactorily 


-  ,  However ,  opportunities emerged when the suppliers of solar energy solutions reexamined the three core questions 


-  ,  Combined with the overall decline in PV prices ,  the introduction of PPAs alongside traditional leasing agreements helped fuel exponential growth in the solar market 


-  each year 


-  ,  It is interesting to note that the market for direct purchases grew impressively as well in the same period ,  from 147 MW to 720 MW 


-  In other words ,  the lower prices for PV panels would have naturally driven growth 


-  The lesson is that products can become even more accessible  and progress toward ambitious environmental ,  social ,  and governance goals can be achieved even faster  when companies are willing to reconsider preconceived notions about their prices 


-  ,  The problem of energy access is universal 


-  Solar home kits have therefore become an attractive alternative ,  because they can help most families meet their basic power needs and avoid relying on diesel generators  ( or going without power )  


-  The upfront retail cost of  basic solar home kit is around $180 ,  but that is  large expense for  family that might earn $1 to $2 per day 


- 10 What has accelerated adoption of the kits is an approach similar to the one used by telcos:  deposit combined with  pay-as-you-go charge 


-  Most people use their cellphones to make the micropayments directly 


- 11 ,  What makes disease management challenging is the wide range of symptoms and the respective costs to treat them 


-  It may cost only  few hundred dollars to treat patients with mild symptoms ,  whereas treatment costs can run as high as $300 , 000 for the roughly 10% of patients who require  liver transplant 


-  ,  This reality presented Gilead Sciences ,  maker of breakthrough HCV therapy Sovaldi ,  with  significant taboo trade-off 


-  But the industrys standard pricing approach  which is to charge  price per treatment at the time of care  makes it prohibitively expensive to treat patients with mild symptoms 


-  At  price tag well north of $50 , 000 for that 12-week course ,  Sovaldi makes economic sense only for that small minority of patients with severe complications 


-  ,   lower price point would broaden access and hasten the World Health Organizations goal of reducing deaths due to HCV by 65% by 2030 


- 12 But it would also make the cure far less profitable ,  creating  quandary for leaders in biopharma companies who have  mandate to recover substantial investments in R&D and yield returns to investors 


-  ,   novel approach to the price mechanism offered the health care ecosystem  way to resolve the taboo trade-off 


-  Gilead worked with the state of Louisiana to rethink two of the fundamental questions outlined above: ,  Spreading payments over time and benefits across the population yields better economics for all 


-  The buyer pays  fixed price for access to  catalog of content ,  rather than paying potentially much more for individual content streams  la carte 


-  This model is similar to the concept of software vendors enterprise license agreements ,  under which an entire population of employees gains access to  software catalog 


-  The supplier secures  constant revenue stream and serves many more users than it would on  case-by-case basis 


-  The buyer secures value over time for the entire population in  way that allows everyone to benefit ,  regardless of their consumption level 


-  ,  In 2019 ,  Louisiana paid  subsidiary of Gilead  lump sum in exchange for as much of its HCV regimen as warranted to treat patients in its Medicaid program and correction facilities through 2024 


- 13 The exact terms of the deal are not known ,  but the amount is estimated to be significantly less than the aggregate sum that would have been necessary to treat all HCV patients at the ongoing per-therapy price 


-  If we assume roughly $35 million per year for the minimum 31 , 000 HCV patients mentioned in the news release ,  that amounts to about $1 , 130 per patient per year for population-level coverage ,  or approximately $5 , 600 per patient over the five years of the contract 


- 15 ,  There is some skepticism about the willingness of different players in the health care ecosystem to come to the table on this type of arrangement versus the more familiar pay-per-treatment one 


-  But several new trends are helping all parties become accustomed to aligning prices with the timing of value delivery in  way that boosts efficiency 


-  These trends include the increasing adoption of quality-adjusted life years as  generic measure of disease burden and  means to price treatments based on health outcomes ,  as evidenced by Roches recent efforts on personalized reimbursement models 


- 16 ,  The cost of higher education in the  


-  ,  One solution addresses the who and the when and how questions ,  and in some cases the what question as well 


-  Known as an income-share agreement  ( ISA )  ,  the arrangement calls for the student to pay the educational institution only when they are earning an annual salary above  certain threshold 


-  The payment is  percentage of their income until the tuition is paid in full 


-  The difference between an ISA and  conventional loan is that there is no interest rate ,  nor are any payments required if the student remains unemployed or earns wages below the threshold 


-  These programs may appeal to students in one- or two-year skill-certificate programs ,  but major universities such as Purdue have also launched ISA programs 


-  The program includes the Tennessee Promise ,  which offers scholarships for qualifying students to attend selected colleges or technical schools for free ,  and Tennessee Reconnect ,  which allows adults without  degree or certification to complete one at no out-of-pocket cost 


-  The difference between the Tennessee programs and an ISA is that there is no repayment plan at all 


-  ,  The program has worked for several years because it aligns the incentives for all parties 


-  Students gain access to an education ,  while the state derives  return on its investment by creating taxpayers and also making the state more attractive to companies that need  large pool of workers with 21st-century skills 


- 20 At the same time ,  the dependence on cotton  and thus the corresponding dependence on irrigation and agrichemicals  has had considerable environmental impact: It can take as much as  , 700 liters of water to make one cotton T-shirt 


- 21 Even then ,  each American on average throws away 80 pounds of textiles every year ,  which adds up to around 12 


-  The Impact Institute estimates the true price of these jeans ,  or the sticker price factoring in the cost to society and the environment of bringing the product to market ,  at 73 euros  ( around $90 )  


- 23 ,  The taboo trade-off here is clear 


-  On the one hand ,  consumers are likely to balk at paying almost twice as much for something intended to last one or two seasons 


-  On the other hand ,  most producers and retailers do not have nearly enough margin to absorb the spike in costs 


-  Faced with this prospect ,  turning  blind eye to the environmental impact is almost understandable 


-  ,  The challenge ,  then ,  is to look for ways to mitigate the negative externalities rather than pricing them in 


-  To that end ,  companies are taking creative steps to reduce the waste inherent in the fashion pipeline 


-  As Karl-Johan Persson ,  then-CEO of H&M ,  explained ,  We have to change how fashion is made 


- 24 ,  This is exactly where rethinking the what question is critically important 


-  The fashion industrys traditional make and sell model ,  where the ownership of an item of clothing transfers from the retailer to the customer at the point of sale ,  puts the responsibility for closing the loop squarely on the shoulders of each individual 


-  This is not efficient ,  given that people differ in their desire to do good and ,  even if sold on the idea of recycling ,  may not have the means or opportunity to do so 


-  ,  One way to motivate people to be more responsible is to pay them for it 


-  This shift in the what does away with having to rely on the conscientiousness of individuals and puts reuse and recycling back on the shoulders of manufacturers ,  which presumably can handle this task more efficiently and at scale 


-  Similarly ,  Rent the Runway lets people rent high-end clothes that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive to purchase ,  while Nuuly offers  clothing subscription that starts with six items for $88 per month 


-  ,  As people grow more accustomed to renting clothes or subscribing to  wardrobe service ,  suppliers gain degrees of freedom to mitigate the taboo trade-off expressed in the true price of clothing 


-  ,  Our own research and work with CEOs and other leaders have convinced us that organizations must rethink the three critical questions we have described if they want to strike  healthier balance between their sustainability goals and their more immediate obligations to customers ,  employees ,  and shareholders 


-  The following recommendations  which run from the initial thought process through to implementation  should guide leaders to find creative new answers to the what ,  who ,  when ,  and how questions 


-  The root cause of the taboo trade-off is what Bill Gates dubbed the green premium 


-  When an environmentally friendly product costs twice as much as the conventional dirty version ,  few customers or businesses are willing to foot the bill 


-  But when managers have greater visibility into what is driving higher costs ,  they can make more informed decisions on where to direct their attention as they reconsider both how prices are set and the decisions in the supply chain that can reduce the footprint of business as usual 


-  Similarly ,  shifting from selling cars to providing mobility may reduce materials consumption and waste while providing vehicle makers and new competitors with new opportunities to meet customer needs 


-  Offering true solutions to customer problems will remain aspirational as long as companies focus too much on the means rather than the end 


-  ,  Align payments and benefits 


-  For many solutions ,  the biggest hurdle is the clear misalignment between the timing of payments  ( usually upfront )  and the onset of benefits  ( usually over time )  


-  For example ,  the sticker price on an electric vehicle such as the Chevrolet Bolt is about 40% higher than  comparable gas-fueled car ,  but the lifetime operating costs are significantly lower for the former ,  never mind the environmental benefit from lower emissions 


- 25 Alternatives to paying upfront ,  such as subscriptions ,  leasing ,  pay-as-you-go models ,  and even performance-based agreements ,  shift the timing of payments to align better with the timing of benefits perceived by customers 


-  Population-based pricing agreements make sense when  solution has broad applicability ,  but individual customers willingness or ability to pay varies dramatically 


-  In this case ,  the what shifts from  single dose or single product to coverage for an entire population 


-  Optimal pricing based on target segments is exclusionary by definition ,  while population-based pricing aims to find  way to be inclusive 


-  and Europe for its COVID-19 vaccine ,  which facilitated much lower price points than normal for such  breakthrough treatment 


-  Rethinking the companys solution or time-shifting this years revenues into the future often creates opportunities that  single company cannot pursue on its own 


-  Creative approaches to the price mechanism tend to involve multiple partners ,  such as financing partners for renewable energy and vehicles ,  and value-based health partners for migrating to health outcomes 


-  While tension may always exist between sustainability and profitability ,  more and more stakeholders are seeing the former as part of long-term value creation rather than  threat to it 


-  For example ,  BlackRock has made  commitment to sustainable investing as  path to long-term value creation ,  and the California Public Employees Retirement System has recently pushed for more accountability on climate risk in oil and gas 


-  In our experience ,  significant changes to the price mechanism requires dedicated communication and engagement with all stakeholders 


-  ,  The way that most companies currently understand the price mechanism does not bode well for their ability to help address the worlds most pressing social and environmental challenges 


-  The narrow focus on price points  what we can refer to simply as the How much? question  imposes constraints on an organizations ability to achieve the scale that its sustainability solutions deserve 


-  ,  Indeed ,  the now-popular notion of green premiums is ,  at its essence ,   redefinition of that narrow How much? question 


-  But business leaders need to stop thinking about pricing simply as  bar that they can prod up or down to get customers to buy less or more 


-  Every pricing decision comprises additional ,  more strategic choices that can mitigate the negative externalities of commerce before companies price them in 


-  Businesses are facing growing pressure to translate commitments into action and impact ,  or they risk jeopardizing their relationships with their increasingly conscientious ,  dollar-voting customers and investors 


-  ,  We obviously are not claiming that rethinking the price mechanism is the ultimate answer  but we are asserting that  more efficient price mechanism is among the necessary means to accelerate progress 


-  Broader thinking on prices will help catalyze the search for innovative and enduring solutions that are profitable ,  scalable ,  and palatable to customers
