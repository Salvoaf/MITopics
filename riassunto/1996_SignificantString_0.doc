-  In the process ,  we have gained some insight into the reasons that some made recognizable progress in their transformational change process while others only replaced the dead weight of their bureaucracies with change program overload 


-  Despite this widespread frenzy of activity ,  the study found no correlation between the number of tools  company used and its satisfaction with its financial performance 


-  ,  The overall objective of the transformation process is to move the entire portfolio into quadrant  and find ways to prevent the units from returning to their old modes of operation 


-  By creating  sense of organizational clarity and managerial simplicity ,  he felt more able to hold them accountable for the results 


-  During the next several years ,  he pushed collaboration deeper into the organization through programs designed to open minds ,  clear communications channels ,  and eliminate the parochial attitudes that had insulated functions ,  isolated businesses ,  and separated operating units from each other 


-  Although he had been extraordinarily successful at meeting his initial objectives ,  Welch understood that he could not achieve his long-term goals unless he won the minds and changed the behaviors of many front-line employees who were suspicious and even cynical about the motivations of  man they had begun to call Neutron Jack 


-  In 1985 ,  he acknowledged to  group of employees ,  A company can boost productivity by restructuring ,  removing bureaucracy ,  and down-sizing ,  but it cannot sustain high productivity without cultural change 


-  ,  Successful corporate transformation ,  as Welch recognized ,  could not simply be imposed from the top through macro change programs 


-  An effective change process needs to focus simultaneously on the companys hardware  its business configuration and organization structure  and on its software  the motivations ,  values ,  and commitments of the companys employees 


-  Our observations suggest that discipline ,  support ,  stretch ,  and trust  the four vital elements of the transformational behavioral context  were most effectively developed sequentially in  way that supported the three stages of renewal 


-  Instilling discipline and support ,  for example ,  is crucial to managing the company through the simplification phase; instilling stretch and trust is essential to effective cross-unit integration; and balancing all four dimensions is the key to moving to  state of continuous regeneration 


-  Forced to divest 70 percent of its assets in an antitrust settlement ,  compelled to confront formidable global competitors in  suddenly deregulated business ,  and confronted with an industry fundamentally restructured by the converging technologies of computers and telecommunications ,  AT&T was  dinosaur on the brink of extinction for the first few years after the companys 1984 breakup 


-  In an organization demotivated by several years of competitive defeats ,  operating losses ,  and personnel cuts ,  Allen saw his main objective as helping our people learn how to win again 


-  As  result of managements relentless insistence that each business prove its economic viability and strategic potential ,  business heads were motivated to translate their broad EVA objectives into  much richer set of internal performance benchmarks that ,  in turn ,  were reflected in clearly defined individual targets right down to the front lines of their operations 


-  Supported by intense communication that helped managers understand the performance impact of their business decisions ,  EVA became more than just  mechanical control system; it became the basis of  behavioral context that resulted in  norm of fulfilling commitments and meeting tough standards   discipline not widely observed in the predivestiture AT&T 


-  Again ,  it was not so much the system as the way senior management used it that was key to shaping the desired behavioral context 


-  Through their practice of conducting open reviews within each unit and between business units and corporate staff ,  Allen and his top team did more than just define standards and clarify expectations 


-  They used these exchanges to educate management to  new way of thinking and to provide honest ,  timely performance evaluations against the new expectations 


-  ,  The third common contextual element in organizations that develop  strong sense of individual discipline is  consistently applied set of rewards and sanctions ,  clearly linked to the performance standards 


-  ,  One of Allens first objectives was to break the sense of control and dependence that often characterized the relationships between superiors and subordinates 


-  He described his philosophy: I have never thought that  could be so knowledgeable about our businesses and markets that  could make the decisions 


-  In fact ,   believe this is one of the reasons  am CEO 


-  Starting with his own actions and those of his colleagues on the executive committee ,  he has tried to become  role model for the desired coaching and supporting relationship 


-  When managers try to escalate issues for his decision ,  he is likely to tell them that his opinion is irrelevant and encourage them to solve the problem themselves 


-  By more effectively linking and leveraging the resources of the  , 300 local companies ,  ABB used its global scale and scope to build new capabilities in existing power-related businesses ,  to develop new business opportunities in areas like environmental engineering ,  and to enter new markets such as Eastern Europe ,  India ,  and China 


-  ,  Beyond changes in the organizational hardware ,  just as the simplification phase needs the behavioral software of discipline and support for effective implementation ,  the integration phase needs  behavioral context of stretch and trust to motivate the vital cross-unit collaboration 


-  ,  Stretch is an attribute of an organizations context that enhances peoples expectations of themselves and the company 


-  First was development of shared ambitions that energized the organization; second was the need to establish unifying values to reinforce an individuals commitment to the organization; and third was an ability to give employees  sense of personal fulfillment by linking their individual contributions directly to the larger corporatewide agenda 


-  ,  To decouple individuals from the parochial interests that drive performance in the simplification stage ,  companies need to motivate them to collaborate 


-  In most organizations ,  this implies creating  shared ambition that exceeds the companys ability to achieve without cooperation: to stretch the organizations collective reach beyond each units individual grasp 


-  At the broadest level ,  Barnevik did this by building  corporatewide commitment to making ABB a global leader  the most competitive ,  competent ,  technologically advanced ,  and quality-minded electrical engineering company in our fields of activity 


-  But rather than leave this broadly framed vision statement unconnected to the organizations day-to-day operations ,  he and his top team traveled 200 days  year to communicate and translate it so that each operating unit began to share the ambition and understand its implications for their own particular objectives 


-  ,  While ambition can be highly energizing ,  only when the organizations objectives connect with an individuals basic belief system is the required personal commitment likely to endure 


-  For example ,  ABB has  stated objective to contribute to environmentally sound sustainable growth and make improved living standards  reality for all nations around the world 


-  To create  sense of stretch ,  companies need to counteract the pervasive meaninglessness that people feel about their contributions and replace it with  sense of personal fulfillment in their work 


-  Through such service ,  these individuals can see firsthand how they fit into the larger objective and ,  more important ,  how their individual efforts contribute to  broader agenda 


-  ,  The ability to link resources and leverage capabilities is central to the integration process ,  and this intensively collaborative behavior cannot be induced solely by stretching peoples goals and expectations 


-  In the second stage of the renewal process ,  the appropriate offsetting quality to stretch is trust ,   contextual characteristic vital to the development and nurturing of the collaborative behavior that drives effective integration 


- 10 ,  Unfortunately ,  the level of trust in  company just emerging from the major restructuring implied by the simplification process is often quite low ,  with autonomous units intensely competing for scarce resources and once loyal employees feeling that their implicit contracts with the company have been violated by serial layoffs and cutbacks 


-  While they tried to minimize its impact during that phase ,  the task of rebuilding individual and intergroup trust was primarily left to the integration stage when frequent and spontaneous cooperation among individuals and across organizational units became vital 


-  Clearly ,  trust is an organizational characteristic that is built only slowly ,  carefully ,  and with  great deal of time and effort 


-  Among the most common behaviors exhibited by managers in organizations that succeeded in developing this vital contextual element were  bias toward inclusion and involvement ,   sense of fairness and equity ,  and  belief in the competence of colleagues 


-  ,  Involvement is  critical prerequisite of trust ,  allowing companies to build both organizational legitimacy and individual credibility 


-  It was developed by  group of managers drawn from deep in the worldwide operations who were asked to define the businesss objectives ,  options ,  and priorities as perceived by those closest to the customers ,  the technologies ,  and competitive markets 


-  The process of developing this strategy and top managements subsequent approval created  strong bond among those on the team and trust in their superiors 


-  ,  Such widespread involvement in the activities and decisions relating to issues beyond their direct control created  vital openness for creating fairness and equity ,  the second component in  trust-building context 


-  The formal matrix organization  the core design element that management believed allowed ABB to manage the dilemmas in its objective to be local and global ,  big and small ,  radically decentralized with central control  required the development of such an organizational norm to resolve the tension implicit in the structural dualities and to manage the conflicting demands in the strategic paradoxes they reflected 


-  The function of the numerous boards ,  teams ,  and councils was not only to allow widespread involvement but also to create the channels and forums in which often conflicting views and objectives could surface and be debated and resolved openly and reasonably 


-  ,  But fairness cannot simply be designed into the structure; it must be reinforced by managers words and actions ,  particularly at the most senior level 


-  The resulting perception of fairness protected and ,  indeed ,  enhanced feelings of trust ,  despite the inherent tensions and painfulness of the decisions 


-  ,  Finally ,  trust requires people to believe in the competence of their colleagues and particularly their leaders ,  because it is in these people that individuals place their confidence as they relinquish the traditional safety of incrementalism to achieve new stretch targets 


-  It was  critical stage of the renewal process that was made possible by managers behavioral changes framed by an expectation of stretch and supported by  growing culture of trust 


-  ,  As in the earlier transformation stages ,  the challenge of the regeneration phase is not just in changing the structure or the processes but ,  rather ,  in fundamentally altering the way managers think and act 


-  When we have developed all our managers into leaders ,  he explained ,  we will have  self-driven ,  self-renewing organization 


-  ,  Top executives at GE and ABB would readily acknowledge ,  however ,  that they have not yet achieved this stage of self-generated continuous renewal 


-  As Maruta stated ,  Distinct creativity became  policy objective ,  supporting our determination to explore and develop our own fields of activity 


-  The first was an ability to integrate the entrepreneurial performance-driving behavior shaped by the contextual elements of discipline and support with the equally vital cross-unit integrative learning framed by the managerial characteristics of stretch and trust 


-  ,  Although respect for individual initiative was central to Kaos philosophy ,  so too was the commitment to organizationwide collaboration ,  particularly as  way to transfer knowledge and leverage expertise 


-  ,  Throughout Kao ,  there was much evidence of this philosophy ,  but  most visible manifestation of its commitment to the sharing of knowledge and expertise was the open conference areas known as decision spaces 


-  ,  Through such processes ,  individual knowledge in particular units was transferred to others ,  with the process becoming embedded in policies ,  practices ,  and routines that institutionalized learning as the company way 


-  ,  The vital management role at this stage was to create and maintain an internal environment that not only stimulated the development of individual knowledge and expertise to drive the performance of each operating unit ,  but also supported the interunit interaction and group collaboration to embed knowledge and develop competencies through an organizational learning process 


-  This demanded the creation of  delicately balanced behavioral context in which the hard-edged norms of stretch and discipline were counterbalanced by the softer values of trust and support to create an integrated system that Maruta likened to the functioning of the human body 


-  ,  At this stage ,  the organization becomes highly effective at developing ,  diffusing ,  and institutionalizing knowledge and expertise 


-  But ,  while  context shaped by discipline ,  support ,  stretch ,  and trust is necessary for organizational regeneration ,  it is not sufficient 


-  The great risk in  finely balanced system of biological self-control such as the one Kao developed is that it can become too effective at embedding expertise and institutionalizing knowledge 


-  Digital Equipments early recognition of  market opportunity for minicomputers grew in its strong commitment to VAX computers that blinded managers to the fact that the segment they were serving was disappearing 


-  Despite the widely advocated notion of organizational fit ,  the top-level managers in the self-regenerating companies we studied were much more concerned about doing what one described as putting  burr under the saddle of corporate self-satisfaction 


-  ,  Contrary to their historically assumed role of reinforcing embedded knowledge through policy statements of the company way and reaffirming well-established capabilities as core competencies ,  top managers in dynamic ,  regenerating companies perceive their task to be almost the opposite 


-  While creating  context in which front-line and middle managers can generate ,  transfer ,  and embed knowledge and expertise ,  they see their role as counterbalancing and constraining that powerful process 


-  By challenging conventional wisdom ,  questioning the data behind accumulating knowledge ,  and recombining expertise to create new capabilities ,  top managers at companies like Kao ,  Intel ,  ISS ,  and 3M created  dynamic imbalance that proved critical in the process of continuous regeneration 


-  ,  Maruta and his colleagues at Kao maintained this state of slight organizational disequilibrium through two major devices:  micro process aimed at providing continuous challenge to individual thinking ,  and  macro process based on regular realignment of the organizational focus and priorities 


-  With regard to the former ,  Maruta was explicit about his willingness to counterbalance the strong unifying force of Kaos highly sophisticated knowledge-building process 


-  He repeatedly told the organization ,  Past wisdom must not be  constraint ,  but something to be challenged 


-  One approach that Maruta adopted to prevent his management team from too readily accepting deeply ingrained knowledge as conventional wisdom was his practice of discouraging managers from referring to historical achievements or established practices in their discussion of future plans 


-  company gave us perhaps the most plausible explanation for this gap between intellectual understanding and emotional commitment to action: The tragedy of top management in large corporations is that it is so much more reassuring to stay as you are ,  even though you know the result will be certain failure ,  than to try to make  fundamental change when you cannot be certain that the effort will succeed 


-  At the same time ,  others like IBM ,  Daimler Benz ,  DEC ,  Philips ,  and Hitachi that have tried alternative routes have made little progress until  change of top management led them to something closer to the model we have described 


-  We hope the road map we have provided will help instill this courage by removing some of the mysticism and uncertainty from the most daunting challenge of corporate leadership today
