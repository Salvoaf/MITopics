-  Many leaders will admit this privately: In an anonymous 2019 survey conducted by Strategy& ,  37% of  , 000 executive respondents said that their company had  well-defined strategy ,  and 35% believed that their companys strategy would lead to success 


-  ,  Great leaders create ways of engaging their teams that can cut through this strategic fog 


-  They may adopt frameworks to guide their analysis ,  but they expect participants in strategy discussions to contribute coherent reasoning and defensible ideas 


-  Amazon is well known for its requirement that major initiatives be proposed in the form of  six-page memo 


-  The virtue of the memo  versus  slide deck  is that writing in full sentences and paragraphs forces leaders to clarify how their ideas connect to each other 


-  Similarly ,  Netflix has driven stunning transformations in the media landscape in part through its success at encouraging its leaders to debate ideas frankly and its willingness to empower them to take risks without waiting for an annual strategy planning process 


-  It is no surprise that CEO Reed Hastings views working from home as a pure negative for the company ,  in part because debating ideas is harder now 


-  ,  The emphasis on vigorous debate at Netflix and Amazon clarifies  truth that many approaches to strategy obscure: At their core ,  all great strategies are arguments 


-  The role of leaders is to formulate ,  discover ,  and revise the logic of success ,  making what we call strategy arguments 


-  ,  Many leaders would agree with this claim but struggle with how to translate the insight into practice 


-  What does it mean to construct  strategy argument? How does one evaluate such an argument? ,  In helping executives answer these questions ,  we have developed  flexible system of three activities: constructive debate ,  iterative visualization ,  and logical formalization 


-  This system is facilitated by  set of concrete activities that can be used to develop  great strategy and execute it on  day-to-day basis 


-  These practices demystify strategy and empower leaders throughout the organization to take control of their strategic destiny 


-  But typically ,  they are omitted from the process of corporate strategy making 


-  ,  The process of creating  great strategy is very different from how that strategy is communicated after its discovery 


-  Put another way ,  executives should learn how to think like Jeff Bezos and Reed Hastings when tackling new problems and not simply study the decisions they made 


-  There is no need to wait for  visionary savior to create great strategy 


-  ,  Many leaders avoid arguing about strategy at all costs 


-  Arguing is the best way to do strategy ,  especially in groups ,  provided the arguments follow established rules of engagement that are rooted in the principles of deductive logic 


-  Great strategy demands the exchange and vetting of ideas  both in its development and implementation 


-  ,  Listen to Patty McCord ,  former chief talent officer at Netflix ,  who asserted ,  The main reason the company could continually reinvent itself and thrive ,  despite so many truly daunting challenges coming at us so fast and furiously ,  was that we taught people to ask ,  How do you know thats true? Or my favorite variant ,  Can you help me understand what leads you to believe thats true? Such questions spawned vigorous internal debates at Netflix that ,  McCord said ,  helped cultivate curiosity and respect and led to invaluable learning both within the team and among functions 


-  ,  Why is debate so powerful? One reason lies in the fallibility of human reasoning 


-  People typically argue inconsistently and are prone to confirmation bias  the tendency to interpret evidence in ways that confirm their preexisting beliefs 


-  Being heard and having your ideas taken seriously leads to higher levels of commitment ,  both to specific strategic decisions and the organization as  whole 


-  ,  Finally ,  reasoned debate is the only way to change how people think 


-  Constructive debate helps participants understand how others in the group see the situation and allows them to arrive at  shared way of thinking 


-  ,  To ensure that debates are constructive and arguing doesnt devolve into browbeating and power plays ,  they need to be orchestrated 


-  This requires thinking about strategic conversations before they begin and answering questions such as the following: ,  What is the purpose of this conversation? Devote time and attention ,  perhaps in consultation with others ,  to specifying the scope and desired outcome of the strategic dialogue in advance 


-  For instance ,  if leaders are concerned about  new competitor ,  the team should debate whether the entrant truly poses  threat before considering costly initiatives to counter it 


-  Accordingly ,  the purpose of the meeting would be to articulate the strategy argument of the new competitor and determine whether it interferes with the companys own logic of success 


-  Providing participants with clear guidance regarding the conversation  ( and assigning prework ,  if needed )  helps them prepare for constructive debate and reduces their uncertainty about the parameters of the discussion 


-  ,  Who should participate? Assemble people with relevant information and expertise ,  those responsible for executing the resulting decisions ,  and those with the power to make the decisions 


-  ,  What are the participants roles? Most participants will arrive with ideas and proposals of their own ,  and the meeting should be structured to encourage everyone to share their views 


-  The facilitators job is to get everyone involved by making the participants feel comfortable expressing their views 


-  The devils advocates job is to challenge claims put forth and ask uncomfortable questions 


-  Ask the remaining participants to leave their job titles and ranks outside the room before the start of the meeting 


-  Try reminding them that although the ultimate decision still rests with them ,  their authority should not be used to squelch debate 


-  Instead ,  they should play subdued roles ,  not shoot down ideas ,  and allow their own arguments to be challenged by those with less power 


-  ,  Where should the session take place? Choose  setting that offers the participants freedom of movement to encourage new ways of thinking 


-  There should be enough space to rearrange the seating and multiple whiteboards for sharing ideas 


-  ,  How should the conversation be opened? Ask whomever decided to convene the discussion and the facilitator to choose  starter question to kick it off 


-  Choosing  good starter question requires trying to imagine the different ways  conversation could go and how  question might be interpreted by the different participants 


-  For instance ,  in  meeting regarding stagnant sales ,   good starter question might involve asking each participant to arrive prepared to state what they believe the cause to be and why 


-  Avoid yes or no questions ,  because they tend to polarize discussions and shut down  full consideration of the issues and processes at hand 


-  ,  Constructively debating  proposed strategy requires  shared understanding of the strategy 


-  ,  During  July 2016 earnings call with Wall Street analysts ,  Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly found himself battered by hostile questions 


-  Analysts wanted to know why Southwest ,  which was experiencing revenue and profit declines ,  was sticking to its long-standing policy of first-come ,  first-served seating instead of following the lead of other airlines and charging passengers  fee for seat assignments 


-  The analysts argued that Southwest was leaving money on the table 


-  But Kelly dismissed the idea ,  claiming that nickel-and-diming passengers ultimately would not increase the airlines profitability 


-  ,  One might imagine that  similar debate had already taken place within Southwests headquarters as the executive team sought to reverse the airlines declining results 


-  In such  situation ,  the ability to argue constructively is critical to reaching the right decision 


-  The intuition that seating fees would not help Southwest might be correct ,  but it should not be accepted simply because it feels right or because thats what the boss believes 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  such debates devolve into shouting matches in many companies 


-  ,  Instead ,  leaders can use strategy maps to surface and examine the underlying logic of their alternatives 


-   strategy map is  visual depiction of  strategy argument ,  using boxes and arrows to represent the structure of connections between ideas 


-  It allows leaders to see how proposed investments and actions are linked to desired outcomes ,  how parts of  business model fit together ,  and how causes will supposedly lead to effects 


-  ,  How might Kelly and his team at Southwest have used  strategy map to guide  discussion of seating fees? To start ,  put yourself in the teams shoes 


-  You know that Southwests ability to perform quick turnarounds of its planes is critical to its cost advantage 


-  When  plane arrives at  departure gate ,  passengers are lined up and ready to go ,  and every employee at the gate and on the plane  flight attendants ,  pilots ,  baggage handlers ,  gate agents  helps them board and get ready for departure 


-  ,  With this in mind ,  any consideration of fee-based seat assignments requires you to speculate about what will happen if Southwest abandons open seating: Will profits go up or will the impact be different? Such speculation involves visualizing scenarios  in this case ,  the current reality of open seating and  counterfactual one with assigned seating  to see how  change might reverberate through the system 


-  The boxes reflect ideas ,  concepts ,  resources ,  or actions ,  while the arrows represent causal claims 


-  An arrow from  to  asserts that  causes   that you believe the teamwork at the gate lowers costs through two distinct channels ,  one leading to greater capacity utilization and one leading to lower staffing levels 


-  ,  Using the map allows the team to envision the impact of assigned seating 


-  Moving away from open seating would increase the workload of gate agents 


-  At other airlines ,  gate agents spend time responding to questions about seat assignments and addressing seat-change requests ,  upgrades ,  and other customer inquiries 


-  ,  It may seem just as easy to talk about alternatives as map them ,  but weve found that there are several benefits to strategy mapping 


-  ,  First ,  strategy maps improve communication by clarifying complex relationships between the elements of an organizations strategy 


-  It is not obviously true that seat assignments would increase costs at Southwest 


-  Creating  strategy map does not resolve the debate ,  but it does make clear how seat assignments may have negative operational consequences 


-  ,  Second ,  strategy maps facilitate constructive debates 


-  Seeing someones argument represented visually creates opportunities for people to recognize and express how their own views differ 


-  An advocate of assigned seating would note that the strategy map ignores the increased revenue it would generate for Southwest ,  leading to  more productive exchange 


-  ,  Third ,  strategy maps help surface unstated beliefs and assumptions 


-  ,   final benefit of strategy mapping is that executives typically find it an intuitive way of developing and representing their arguments 


-  Indeed ,  many already sketch out their ideas in this way 


-  Still ,  productive strategy mapping takes discipline and practice 


-  Here are  few tips for using strategy maps: ,  Start with the conclusion ,  and map only one conclusion at  time 


-  Limiting the scope of the exercise helps avoid emotional and unpredictable disputes 


-  ,  Identify and organize all plausible explanations 


-  Adopt  brainstorming mindset to generate as many ideas as possible ,  including some  ( or many )  that are outside the box 


-  For instance ,  at Southwest ,  the participants could have been asked to list all the activities and factors that enable the company to offer air travel at lower costs than its competitors 


-  If the number of ideas starts to seem unmanageable ,  cluster them into related themes and concepts 


-  This is particularly easy to do if the initial ideas have been captured on sticky notes 


-  The quality of  strategy map depends on the how comprehensively it captures the causes  ( conditions ,  assumptions ,  or premises )  that might plausibly generate the maps conclusion 


-  Combine and recombine the ideas on sticky notes to show how inputs lead to outputs or causes to effects 


-  This iterative process enables the participants to explore the relationships between different ideas in  flexible ,  dynamic manner 


-  ,  Strategic debates within companies tend to rely heavily on informal exchanges 


-  Executives express ideas about the effects of  new rival ,   government policy ,  or an emerging technology on  strategic outcome and link it to  particular course of action 


-  With  valid argument ,  if you accept the premises ,  you must accept the conclusion 


-  With an invalid argument ,  you run the risk of overlooking critical assumptions and flaws in your reasoning ,  which in turn can lead to your companys downfall 


-  ,  When Apple released the first iPhone in 2007 ,  executives at Nokia ,  then the leader in the mobile phone market ,  thought the new product had little chance of success 


-  Its use was limited to 2G networks ,  whereas the leading phones were using the 3G standard 


-  Imagine the debates that likely took place 


-  The iPhone does not have good cellular phone technology ,  so it will not win in the cellular phone market ,  asserts the skeptic 


-  Youre wrong! Apple has an amazing design sensibility ,  so of course they will dominate the cell phone market ,  argues the believer 


-  Come on! Its  lousy phone; there is no way they can win ,  responds the skeptic 


-  ,  This kind of exchange ,  familiar as it may be ,  is rarely productive 


-  Such debates lead to bad decisions because of flawed logic 


-  ,  The problem starts with the initial claim  ( The iPhone does not have good cellular phone technology ,  so it will not win in the cellular phone market )  


-  The conclusion  (  so it will not win in the cellular phone market )  does not necessarily follow from the premise on which it is based  ( The iPhone does not have good cellular phone technology )  


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  incomplete arguments of this type are not only common ,  they also can carry  lot of weight in strategic debates 


-  Leaders and their audiences do not notice their gaps ,  because they appeal to implicit premises in their minds 


-  Instantly and subconsciously ,  their minds bridge the gap with these implicit premises 


-  This makes for easy conversation and lively debate ,  but it undermines good reasoning 


-  ,  Strategy mapping encourages leaders to be more explicit about their claims 


-  ,  Assessing validity is easier when strategy arguments are stated in propositional form 


-  If you do this with the initial claim in the iPhone example ,  you get two statements: ,  Statement 1: The iPhone does not have good cellular phone technology 


-  ,  Statement 2: The iPhone will not win in the cellular phone market 


-  ,  The first statement is  premise  an empirical assumption about the iPhone that may or may not be true  and the second is the conclusion 


-  The logical problem here is that nothing connects the two statements 


-  ,  Logical formalization involves making the argument complete by explicitly stating how you believe Statements  and  are connected to each other ,  as so: ,  Premise A: The iPhone does not have good cellular phone technology 


-  ,  Premise B: If  product has good cellular phone technology ,  then it will win in the cellular phone market 


-  ,  Conclusion C: The iPhone will not win in the cellular phone market 


-  ,  The claim is now complete  ( there are no missing premises )  ,  but the argument isnt logically valid yet 


-  It is easy to see why the conclusion does not necessarily follow: We know of many examples where the technically superior product has not won in the market 


-  It could be that none of the products in the market has good technology ,  and yet there will be  winner 


-  ,  Still ,  the restated argument offers progress ,  because now we know what to fix 


-   logically valid argument could be constructed by revising Premise B: ,  Premise B*: If  product does not have good cellular phone technology ,  then it cannot win in the cellular phone market 


-  ,  The widespread agreement that the first iPhone would not succeed because it was not  very good phone was mistaken 


-  Nokia executives ,  on the other hand ,  could reasonably believe that good cellular phone technology was  prerequisite for success 


-  But by using logical formalization to identify what must be true for  certain vision of the future to hold ,  you can shift the terms of debate in productive ways 


-  It helps bring the critical issues into focus ,  and it will help members of your strategy team move from fighting about whether they believe  conclusion to recognizing what they have to believe in order for it to be true 


-  Here are two tips that can help: ,  Start with the easy stuff 


-  As in the iPhone example ,  begin by trying to fill in the missing premises in an informal claim 


-  If the informal claim is A is true ,  so  will happen ,  convert it into an if-then statement  ( If  ,  then  )  to make the causality clear 


-  This may seem trivial ,  but an if-then statement represents  theory of how the world works ,  and stating it explicitly forces people to consider whether it holds under all circumstances 


-  Keep in mind that the goal in formalizing  strategy argument is not the unassailable perfection that  logician seeks ,  but  deep ,  shared understanding of what your colleagues are saying 


-  Often ,  people will have different ways of phrasing new linking premises; use those differences to illuminate conflicting ideas and arrive at  more comprehensive and collective understanding of the argument 


-  The decisions entail trade-offs: having the courage and the discipline to say no to one course of action in the uncertain hope that another will be more promising 


-  Frequently ,  these choices are irreversible  and their outcomes are likely to affect the careers of the leaders making them 


-  Yet ,  as we have seen ,   majority of leaders lack confidence in the soundness of their companies strategies 


-  ,  Much of the problem with strategy-making arises because executives focus on predicting what the world will look like in the future when debating strategic decisions 


-  This is unproductive and frustrating; even the most accurate predictions are worth little if they are not embedded in  logically coherent strategy argument 


-  ,  The core of every great strategy is  valid argument 


-  It should include what needs to be true for the strategy to succeed ,  and it should specify the resources  ( people ,  technology ,  finances ,  and even regulators )  required to execute it 


-  Constructive debate ,  iterative visualization ,  and logical formalization are essential tools for arriving at such arguments 


-  They are  practical and accessible way for working executives and their teams to develop the skills and habits of mind needed to achieve strategic success
