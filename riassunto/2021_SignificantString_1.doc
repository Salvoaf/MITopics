- Attract and retain top talent ,  boost morale ,  build brand awareness ,  give back to the community  these are among the most common reasons companies support employee volunteering ,  often through flexible scheduling or paid time off 


-  And when they acquire new skills ,  they feel they are more likely to succeed in their jobs 


-  But such positioning matters 


-  In fact ,  many admitted that they had never thought about learning from volunteering before 


-  ,  What explains the difference in responses? Our analysis suggests that it depends on how people interpret their employers motives 


-   How would you answer that question? In  sharp tone ,  he insisted ,  I wanted to volunteer purely to offer my own personal assistance ,  and he accused management of being immoral for suggesting that volunteering is  route to skill development 


-  It seems that this response surged in some of our volunteers because they felt that our question challenged their moral identity and integrity: They questioned how the business could think that their work with charities was motivated by anything but  desire to help others 


-  One volunteer who said ,  [I want to] make my point very clear ,  stated ,  For me ,  its about putting into the community; its not enough to say ,  Well ,   am going to put into the community if  get something back out of it 


-  With  raised voice ,  one volunteer argued ,  Its not about developing me as  person for the benefit of my company; it is about using my skills to give back to the community 


-  Even though prior research indicates that most volunteers appreciate opportunities to apply and develop skills ,  and the organizations we studied had an explicit goal to increase skills-based volunteering ,  this subset of volunteers adamantly denied that they engaged in volunteering to develop skills 


-  ,  Now lets consider the approximately two-thirds of volunteers who responded with curiosity rather than hostility or defensiveness 


-  For instance ,  one stated ,  I have never thought about volunteering as me learning something; volunteering ,  in my mind ,  is always like giving up my time to help others 


-  At least initially ,  many volunteers did not focus on the fact that activities such as participating in mentorship opportunities ,  delivering job preparation workshops ,  or serving on  nonprofit organizations board enabled them to leverage their existing skill sets or gain new ones 


-  ,  As the interviews progressed ,  though ,  we noticed that these volunteers embarked on  sensemaking journey 


- 12 Our respondents noted how the interview process aided their sensemaking 


-  One pointed out ,  I think that just talking to you ,  what  am realizing is that we are doing this volunteering and most people participating probably arent understanding what they are learning from it ,  including myself 


-  ,  Once interviewees started to make sense of their experiences ,  they were able to articulate how and what they had learned 


-   think the biggest skill is facilitation ,  he said ,  noting that he has grown by developing empathy and [an] understanding of other peoples circumstances and bringing that to my day-to-day role 


- 13 ,  Sensemaking not only enables learning but also prompts individuals to springboard into action and ask ,  What now?14 We found that volunteers discussed the potential to gain and share skills in ways that they had not considered before 


-  She stated ,  I think some skills-based volunteering would be really rewarding 


-    think that would be really good ,  actually ,  to do something like that 


-  She thought that mentorship could also develop her people-management skills by providing her with opportunities to appreciate different learning styles and to practice communicating clearly 


-  Once interviewees had made sense of skills-based volunteering ,  many suggested that they would seek ,  as one put it ,  volunteering that fits in with what  want to give and gain 


-  ,  What explains the wildly different responses to our questions about learning and development? They seemed to hinge on how people interpreted their employers motives 


-  ,  Volunteers who were morally outraged at the suggestion that they could learn from skills-based volunteering were ,  on the whole ,  also suspicious of their companys reasons for supporting it 


-  One volunteer commented that the company looking good was the real purpose; another sneered ,  Everybody goes ,  Oh ,  look at my company ,  arent they great? Negative impressions seemed to be reinforced by line managers who consider volunteering a cop-out of doing work and who hold the perception that it actually takes people away from what they should be doing 


-  Several mentioned the importance of senior leader support: Its leadership ,  its culture ,  its infectious  and if the right advocacy is there at the right level ,   have no doubt that it infiltrates in  positive way 


- 15 So it makes sense that volunteers responded differently depending on how they perceived their employers motives 


-  Leaders need to clearly articulate their companies reasons for supporting skills-based volunteering 


-  If employees are led to believe that  companys sole motive is to give back to the community but they later realize that volunteering is noted in their performance appraisals or professional development plans ,  they may feel that they have been duped 


-  This involves explaining to line managers and employees how skills-based giving can fuel individual growth  and how that growth can enrich future giving as well as enhance work performance 


-  Facilitate sensemaking 


-  Leaders need to carve out time for volunteers to reflect on their experiences and help them with that exploration 


-  Volunteers in our study realized only through the interview process ,  which became  guided sensemaking exercise ,  that they had developed or gained skills 


-  Many indicated that they came away from the interview with  feeling of greater pride and with goals to further their development through volunteering 


-  Learning and development specialists can organize sensemaking sessions to provide the place and the space to proactively reflect on skill development and consider how it might be applied to other contexts 


-  This possibility is especially promising for organizations that want to tie strategy to sustainability and to integrate core values in HR functions such as training and development 


-  But again ,  the business must be transparent with employees about the multiple purposes of the leadership program  ( giving back ,  developing employee skills ,  and reinforcing the companys mission )  ,  and participants must be provided with opportunities to make sense of their growth 


-  Managers should clarify the multiple gains that can be achieved ,  and ,  to optimize learning ,  they need to provide ample opportunities for employees to reflect on and discuss their experiences
