-  These breakthroughs are akin to the S-curves of technology that characterize the life cycle of many industrial and consumer products: Introduction  Acceleration  Acceptance  Maturity 


-  Yet ,  within  relatively short time ,  the new approach becomes so widely accepted that it is difficult even for old-timers to reconstruct how the world looked before 


-  By the late 1970s ,  the array of strategic concepts  ( SWOT analysis ,  the five forces framework ,  experience curves ,  strategic portfolios ,  the concept of competitive advantage )  had become standard ordnance in the management arsenal 


-  ,  It is useful to step back and reflect on the scientific underpinnings to this legacy 


-  [Atoms] became the individual ,  force became the economists notion of marginal utility  ( or demand )  ,  kinetic energy became total expenditure 


-  All of this was synthesized into  coherent theory by Alfred Marshall  known as the theory of industrial organization 


-  ,  Marshalls work and its underpinnings in nineteenth century physics exert  huge influence on strategic thinking to this day 


-  From our concept of strategy to our efforts at organizational renewal ,  the deep logic is based on assumptions of deterministic cause and effect  (  


-  ,   billiard ball model of how competitors will respond to  strategic challenge or how employees will behave under  new incentive scheme )  


-  And all of this ,  consistent with Newtons initial conceptions ,  is assumed to take place in  world where time ,  space  (  


-  ,   particular industry structure or definition of  market )  ,  and dynamic equilibrium are accepted as reasonable underpinnings for the formulation of executive action 


-  Marshalls equilibrium model offered appropriate approximations for the dominant sectors of agriculture and manufacturing of his era and are still useful in many situations 


-  But these constructs run into difficulty in the far from equilibrium conditions found in todays service ,  technology ,  or communications-intensive businesses 


- com ,  Dell Computer ,  or CNN invade  market ,  they succeed despite what traditional strategic thinkers would write off as  long shot 


-  ,  During the 1980s and 1990s ,  performance improvement  (  


-  ,  total quality management ,  kaizen ,  just-intime ,  reengineering )  succeeded the strategic era 


-  Many are exhausted by the pace of change ,  and their harried attempts to execute new initiatives fall short of expectations 


-  To succeed ,  the next big idea must address the biggest challenge facing corporations today  namely ,  to dramatically improve the hit rate of strategic initiatives and attain the level of renewal necessary for successful execution 


-  Scientists use the term complex adaptive systems  ( complexity for short )  to label these theories 


-  But the work has identified principles that apply to many living things amoebae and ant colonies ,  beehives and bond traders ,  ecologies and economies ,  you and me 


-  ,  For an entity to qualify as  complex adaptive system ,  it must meet four tests 


-  Second ,  it continuously shuffles these building blocks and generates multiple levels of organization and structure 


-  Third ,  it is subject to the second law of thermodynamics ,  exhibiting entropy and winding down over time unless replenished with energy 


-  In this sense ,  complex adaptive systems are vulnerable to death 


-  Fourth ,   distinguishing characteristic ,  all complex adaptive systems exhibit  capacity for pattern recognition and employ this to anticipate the future and learn to recognize the anticipation of seasonal change 


-  ,  Many systems are complex but not adaptive  (  


-  But neither of these complex systems anticipates and learns 


-  Only living systems cope with their environment with  predictive model that anticipates and pro-acts 


-   group of distinguished scientists with backgrounds in particle physics ,  microbiology ,  archaeology ,  astrophysics ,  paleontology ,  zoology ,  botany ,  and economics were drawn together by similar questions 


-  These might be molecules ,  neurons ,   species ,  customers ,  members of  social system ,  or networks of corporations 


-  Further ,  these fundamental systems were continually organizing and reorganizing themselves ,  all flourishing in  boundary between rigidity and randomness and all occasionally forming larger structures through the clash of natural accommodation and competition 


-  Molecules form cells; neurons cluster into neural networks  ( or brains )  species form ecosystems; individuals form tribes or societies; consumers and corporations form economies 


-  These self-organizing structures give rise to emergent behavior  ( an example of which is the process whereby pre-biotic chemicals combined to form the extraordinary diversity of life on earth )  


-  Complexity science informs us about organization ,  stability ,  and change in social and natural systems 


-  It points to fundamental limits to our ability to understand ,  control ,  and manage the world ,  and the need for us to accept unpredictability and change 


-  ,  The science of complexity has yielded four bedrock principles relevant to the new strategic work: ,  Is complexity just interesting science ,  or does it represent something of great importance in thinking about strategic work? As these illustrations suggest ,  treating organizations as complex adaptive systems provides useful insight into the nature of strategic work 


-  In the following pages ,   will  (  )  briefly describe how the four bedrock principles of complexity occur in nature ,  and  (  )  demonstrate how they can be applied in  managerial context 


-  In particular ,   use the efforts underway at Royal Dutch/Shell to describe an extensive and pragmatic test of these ideas 


-  ,  The successes at Shell and other companies described here might be achieved with  more traditional mind-set  ( in much the same way as Newtons laws can be used to explain the mechanics of matter on earth with sufficient accuracy so as to not require the General Theory of Relativity )  


-  Deep theories reveal previously unsuspected aspects of reality that we dont see  ( the curvature of space-time in the case of relativity theory )  and thereby alter the fabric of reality 


-  This is the context for an article on complexity science and strategy 


-  Complexity makes the strategic challenge more understandable and the task of strategic renewal more accessible 


-  ,  An obscure but important law of cybernetics ,  the law of requisite variety ,  states: For any system to survive ,  it must cultivate variety in its internal controls 


-  If it fails to do so internally ,  it will fail to cope with variety successfully when it comes from an external source 


-  When  lightening strike and ill-timed winds created  conflagration that could not be contained ,  this carpet of dry material burned longer and hotter than normal 


-  By suppressing natural fires for close to 100 years ,  the park service had prevented the forest floor from being cleansed in  natural rhythm 


-  This is the price of enforced equilibrium 


-  ,  The seductive pull of equilibrium poses  constant danger to successful established companies 


-  Jim Cannavino ,   former IBM senior executive ,  provides an anecdote that speaks to the hazards of resisting change 


-  In 1993 ,  Cannavino was asked by IBMs new CEO ,  Lou Gerstner ,  to take  hard look at the strategic planning process 


-  Why had IBM so badly missed the mark? Cannavino dutifully examined the work product  library shelves filled with blue binders containing twenty years of forecasts ,  trends ,  and strategic analysis 


-  We saw it coming  PC open architecture ,  networking intelligence in microprocessors ,  higher margins in software and services than hardware; it was all there 


-  How did they reflect the shifts the strategists had projected? These blue volumes  ( three times as voluminous as the strategic plans )  could also be summarized in one sentence: Nothing changed 


-  And the final dose of arsenic to this diet of cyanide was the year-end financial reconciliation process 


-  When we rolled up the sector submissions into totals for the corporation ,  the growth opportunities never quite covered the erosion of market share 


-  This shortfall ,  of course ,  was the tip of an iceberg that would one day upend our strategy and our primary product  the IBM 360 mainframe 


-  But facing these fundamental trends would have precipitated  great deal of turmoil and instability 


-  ,  While equilibrium endangers living systems ,  it often wears the disguise of an attribute 


-  Equilibrium is concealed inside strong values or  coherent ,  close-knit social system ,  or within  companys well-synchronized operating system  ( often referred to as organizational fit )  


-  Vision ,  values ,  and organizational fit are double-edged swords 


-  ,  Species are inherently drawn toward the seeming oasis of stability and equilibrium  and the further they drift toward this destination ,  the less likely they are to adapt successfully when change is necessary 


-  So why dont all species drift into the thrall of equilibrium and die off? Two forces thwart equilibrium and promote instability:  (  )  the threat of death ,  and  (  )  the promise of sex 


-  ,  The Darwinian process ,  called selection pressures by natural scientists ,  imposes harsh consequences on species entrapped in equilibrium 


-  But from the vantage point of the larger ecological community ,  selection pressures enforce an ecological upgrade ,  insofar as mutations that survive offer  better fit with the new environment 


-  Natural selection exerts itself most aggressively during periods of radical change 


-  Few readers will have difficulty identifying these forces at work in industry today 


-  Nature hedges against this condition through the reproductive process 


-  Of the several means of reproduction that have evolved on the planet ,  sex is best 


-  It is decisively superior to parthenogenesis  ( the process by which most plants ,  worms ,  and  few mammals conceive offspring through self-induced combination of identical genetic material )  


- 10 ,  How does this relate to organizations? In organizations ,  people are the chromosomes ,  the genetic material that can create variety 


- 11 ,  Heres the rub: The exchanges of DNA attempted within social systems are not nearly as reliable as those driven by the mechanics of reproductive chemistry 


-  True ,  organizations can hire from the outside ,  bring seniors into frequent contact with iconoclasts from the ranks ,  or confront engineers and designers with disgruntled customers 


-  But the enemy of these methods is ,  of course ,  the existing social order ,  which ,  like the bodys immune defense system ,  seeks to neutralize ,  isolate ,  or destroy foreign invaders 


-  Antibodies in the form of social norms ,  corporate values ,  and orthodox beliefs nullify the advantages of diversity 


-  The numbing effects of tradition   staggering $130 billion in annual revenues ,  105 , 000 predominantly long-tenured employees ,  and global operations  left Shell vulnerable 


-  ,  Miller was appointed group managing director of Shells worldwide oil products business  ( known as Downstream )  ,  which accounts for $40 billion of revenues within the Shell Group 


-  During the previous two years ,  the company had been engaged in  program to transform the organization 


-  Yet the regimen of massive reorganization ,  traumatic downsizing ,  and senior management workshops accomplished little 


-  Shells earnings ,  while solid ,  were disappointing to financial analysts who expected more from the industrys largest competitor 


-  And the operating units at the coal face  ( Shells term for its front-line activities within the 130 countries where Downstream does business )  saw little more than business as usual 


-  The Downstream business accounted for 37 percent of Shells assets 


-  Among the businesses in the Shell Groups portfolio ,  Downstream faced the gravest competitive threats 


-  From 1992 to 1995 ,   full 50 percent of Shells retail revenues in France fell victim to the onslaught of the European hypermarkets;  similar pattern was emerging in the United Kingdom 


-  Elsewhere in the world ,  new competitors ,  global customers ,  and more savvy national oil companies were demanding  radically different approach to the marketplace 


-  Having observed Shells previous transformation efforts ,  Miller was convinced that it was essential to reach around the resistant bureaucracy and involve the front lines of the organization ,   formidable task given the sheer size of the operation 


-  In addition to Downstreams 61 , 000 full-time employees ,  Shells 47 , 000 filling stations employed hundreds of thousands ,  mostly part-time attendants and catered to more than 10 million customers every day 


-  In the language of complexity ,  Miller believed it necessary to tap the emergent properties of Shells enormous distribution system and shift the locus of strategic initiative to the front lines 


-  He saw this system as  fertile organism that needed encouragement to ,  in his words ,  send green shoots forth 


-  ,  In an effort to gain the organizations attention  (  


-  ,  disturb equilibrium )  ,  beginning in mid-1996 ,  Miller reallocated more than 50 percent of his calendar to work directly with front-line personnel 


-  Miller states: ,  Our Downstream business transformation program had bogged down largely because of the impasse between headquarters and the operating companies Shells term for its highly independent country operations 


-  But the forces for continuing in the old way were enormous and extended throughout the organization 


-  This had been part of our success formula 


-  Yet we were encountering  set of daunting competitive threats that transcended national boundaries 


-  Global customers like British Airways or Daimler Benz  wanted to deal with one Shell contact ,  not with  different Shell representative in every country in which they operate 


-  These problems begged for  new strategic approach in which the task at the top was to provide the framework and then unleash the regional and local levels to find  path that was best for their market and the corporation as  whole 


-  ,  Shell had tried to rationalize its assets through  well-engineered strategic response: directives were issued by the top and driven through the organization 


-  But country heads successfully thwarted consolidation under the banner of host-country objections to the threatened closing of their dedicated refining capacity 


-  Miller continues: We were equally unsuccessful at igniting  more imaginative approach toward the marketplace 


-  It was like the old game of telephone that we used to play when we were kids: youd whisper  message to the person next to you ,  and it goes around the circle 


-  By the time you get to the last person ,  it bears almost no resemblance to the message you started with 


-  Apply that to the 61 , 000 people in the Downstream business across the globe ,  and  knew our strategic aspirations could never penetrate through to the marketplace 


-  The linkages between directives given and actions taken are too problematic 


-  What made sense to Miller was to fundamentally alter the conversation and unleash the emergent possibilities 


-  Midway through the process ,  Miller became acquainted with core principles of living systems and adopted them as  framework to provide his organization with  context for renewal 


-  But the alternative wasnt centralization  it was  radical change in the responsiveness of the Downstream business to the dynamics of the marketplace  from top to bottom such that we could come together in appropriate groups ,  solve problems ,  and operate in  manner which transcended the old headquarters versus field schism 


-  What initially seemed like  huge conflict has gradually melted away ,   believe ,  because we stopped treating the Downstream business like  machine to be driven and began to regard it as  living system that needed to evolve 


-  ,  Millers solution was to cut through the organizations layers and barriers ,  put senior management in direct contact with the people at the grassroots level ,  foster strategic initiatives ,  create  new sense of urgency ,  and overwhelm the old order 


-  The first wave of initiatives spawned other initiatives 


-  In Malaysia ,  for example ,  Millers pilot efforts with four initiative teams  ( called action labs )  have proliferated to forty 


-  It worked ,  he states ,  because the people at the coal face usually know whats going on 


-  Once you give them the context ,  they can do  better job of spotting opportunities and stepping up to decisions 


-  In less than two years ,  weve seen astonishing progress in our retail business in some twenty-five countries 


-  This represents around 85 percent of our retail sales volume ,  and we have now begun to use this approach in our service organizations and lubricant business 


-  Results? By the end of 1997 ,  Shells operations in France had regained initiative and achieved double-digit growth and double-digit return on capital 


-  By the close of 1998 ,  approximately 10 , 000 Downstream employees have been involved in this effort with audited results  ( directly attributed to the program )  exceeding  $300 million contribution to Shells bottom line 


-  His lifetime fascination has been with the ordered process by which  fertilized egg unfolds into  newborn infant and later into an adult 


-  Modern computers use sequential instructions ,  whereas the genetic system exercises most of its instructions simultaneously 


-  For decades ,  scientists have sought to discover the governing mechanism that causes this simultaneous ,  nonlinear system to settle down and replicate  species 


- 13 ,  Kauffman built  simple simulation of  genetic system 


-  Since regulatory genes cause the cells  ( like bulbs )  to turn on or off ,  Kauffman arranged for his bulbs to do just that ,  each independently of the other 


-  His hypothesis was that no governing mechanism existed; rather ,  random and independent behavior would settle into patterns   view that was far from self-evident 


-  ,  on and off )  ,  multiplied by itself 100 times  (  


-  ,  When Kauffman switched the system on ,  the result was astonishing 


-  Instead of patterns of infinite variety ,  the system always settled down within  few minutes to  few more or less orderly states 


-  Similar phenomena hold true in business 


-  Mathematics has coined the term fractals to describe  set of simple equations that combine to form endless diversity 


-  Mountains ,  rivers ,  coastline vegetation ,  lungs ,  and circulatory systems are fractal ,  replicating  dominant pattern at several smaller levels of scale 


-  Fractals ,  in effect ,  act like genetic algorithms enabling  species to efficiently replicate essential functions 


-  ,  One consequence of emerging complexity is that you cannot see the end from the beginning 


-  While many can readily acknowledge natures propensity to self-organize and generate more complex levels ,  it is less comforting to put oneself at the mercy of this process with the foreknowledge that we cannot predict the shape that the future will take 


-  ,  Building on  (  )  the principles of complexity ,  (  )  the fractal-like properties of  business model developed by Columbia Universitys Larry Seldon , 17 and  (  )   second fractal-like process ,  the action labs ,  Steve Miller and his colleagues at Shell tapped into the intelligence in the trenches and channeled it into  tailored marketplace response 


-  The properties of self-organization and emergence make intuitive sense to me 


-  Seldons model gave us  sharp-edged tool to identify customer needs and markets and to develop our value proposition 


-  This ,  in effect ,  gave our troops the ammunition to shoot with  analytical distinctions to make the business case 


-  Yet the forecourt of every service station is an artery for commerce that any retailer would envy 


-  Our task was to tap the potential of that real estate ,  and we needed both the insight and the initiatives of our front-line troops to pull it off 


-  For  company as large as Shell ,  leadership cant drive these answers down from the top 


-  The first five-day workshop introduced tools for identifying and exploiting market opportunities 


-  Participants returned ready to apply the tools to achieve breakthroughs such as doubling net income in filling stations on the major north-south highways of Malaysia or tripling market share of bottled gas in South Africa 


-  ,  to lower fuel delivery costs )  was translated into key business activities  ( or KBAs )  


-  During the next sixty days ,  the first group of teams used the analytical tools to sample customers ,  identify segments ,  and develop  value proposition 


-  The group would then return to the workshop for  peer challenge tough give-and-take exchanges with other teams 


-  Then it would go back again for another sixty days to perfect  business plan 


-  At the close of the third workshop ,  each action lab spent three hours in the fishbowl with Miller and several of his direct reports ,  reviewing business plans ,  while the other teams observed the proceedings 


-  At the close of each session ,  plans were approved ,  rejected ,  amended 


-  Financial commitments were made in exchange for promised results 


-  ,  Week after week ,  team after team ,  continues Miller ,  my six direct reports and  and our internal coaches reached out and worked directly with  diverse cross-section of customers ,  dealers ,  shop stewards ,  and young and mid-level professionals 


-  Operating company CEOs ,  historically leery of any help from headquarters ,  saw their people return energized and armed with solid plans to beat the competition 


-  The grassroots employees who participated in the program got to touch and feel the new Shell   far more informal ,  give-and-take culture 


-  The conversation down in the ranks of the organization began to change 


-  Guerrilla leaders ,  historically resigned to Shells conventional way of doing things ,  stepped forward to champion ingenious marketplace innovations  ( such as the Coca-Cola Challenge in Malaysia   free Coke to any service-station customer who is not offered the full menu of forecourt services 


-  Many ,  if not most ,  of the ideas come from the lower ranks of our company who are in direct contact with the customer 


-   cant overstate how infectious the optimism and energy of these committed employees was for the many managers above them 


-  In  curious way ,  these front-line employees taught us to believe in ourselves again 


-  ,  As executives move up in organizations ,  they become removed from the work that goes on in the fields 


-  Directives from the top become increasingly abstract as executives tend to rely on mechanical cause-and-effect linkages to drive the business: strategic guidelines ,  head-count controls ,  operational expense targets ,  pay-for-performance incentives ,  and so forth 


-  These are the tie rods and pistons of social engineering  the old model of change 


-  Complexity theory does not discard these useful devices but it starts from  different place 


-  The living-systems approach begins with  focus on the intelligence in the nodes 


-  His design for emergence generated hundreds of informal connections between headquarters and the field ,  resembling the parallel networks of the nervous system to the brain 


-  ,  Nothing novel can emerge from systems with high degrees of order and stability  for example ,  crystals ,  incestuous communities ,  or regulated industries 


-  On the other hand ,  complete chaotic systems ,  such as stampedes ,  riots ,  rage ,  or the early years of the French Revolution ,  are too formless to coalesce 


-  ,  Historically , 19 science viewed change as moving from one equilibrium state  ( water )  to another  ( ice )  


-  Ecologists and economists similarly favored equilibrium conditions because neither observation nor modeling techniques could handle transition states 


-  The relatively inexpensive computational power of modern computers has changed all that 


-  ,  Phase transitions occur in the realm near chaos where  relatively small and isolated variation can produce huge effects 


-  Consider the example of lasers: while only  complex system and not an adaptive one ,  the infusion of energy into plasma excites  jumble of photons 


-  ,  Two factors determine the level of excitation in  system 


-  Living systems thrive when these mechanisms are in tension 


-  Business obituaries abound with examples of one or the other of these feedback systems gone amok 


-  At the opposite end ,  Value Jet thrives in an amplifying phase ,  adds more planes ,  departures ,  and staff without corresponding attention to the damping loop  ( operational controls ,  safety ,  reliability ,  and service standards )  


-  ,  Psychologists tell us that pain can cause us to change ,  and this is most likely to occur when we recontextualize pain as the means by which significant learning occurs 


-  When the great Austro-American economist Joseph Schumpeter described the essence of free-market economies as creative destruction ,  it could be interpreted as  characterization of the hazards near the edge of chaos 


-  Enduring competitive advantage entails disrupting what has been done in the past and creating  new future 


-  ,  Hewlett-Packards printer business was one of the most successful in its portfolio 


-  Observing  downward spiral of margins as many me too printers entered the market ,  HP reinvented its offering 


-  To maintain scale ,  HP abandoned its high-cost distribution system with  dedicated sales force ,  opting instead for mass channels ,  partnering ,  and outsourcing to lower manufacturing costs 


-  To protect margins ,  it targeted its forty biggest corporate customers and formed  partnership to deliver global business printing solutions whether through low-cost ,  on-premise equipment ,  or networked technology 


-  States Tim Mannon ,  president of HPs printer division: The biggest single threat to our business today is staying with  previously successful business model one year too long 


- 21 ,  Shell moved to the edge of chaos with  multi-pronged design that intensified stress on all members of the Shell system 


- 22 First ,  as noted ,  Miller and his top team performed major surgery on their calendars and reallocated approximately half their time to teaching and coaching wave after wave of country teams 


-  When the lowest levels of an organization were being trained ,  coached ,  and evaluated by those at the very top ,  it both inspired  and stressed everyone in the system  ( including mid-level bosses who were not present )  


-  Second ,  the design ,  as we have seen ,  sent teams back to collect real data for three periods of sixty days  ( interspersed with additional workshop sessions )  


-  Pressure to succeed and long hours both during the workshops and back in the country  ( where these individuals continued to carry their regular duties along with project work )  achieved the cultural unfreezing effects 


-  That may not sound revolutionary  but in our culture ,  it was very unusual for anyone lower in the organization to talk this directly to  managing director and his reports 


-  The first time were not consistent ,  were dead meat 


-  If we cover for people or praise everyone ,  what do we say when someone brings in an excellent plan? That kind of straight talk is another big culture change for Shell 


-  ,  The whole process creates complete transparency between the people at the coal face and me and my top management team 


-  At the end ,  these folks go back home and say ,  I just cut  deal with the managing director and his team to do these things 


-  It creates  personal connection ,  and it changes how we talk with each other and how we work with each other 


-  After that ,   can call up those folks anywhere in the world and talk in  very direct way because of this personal connectedness 


-  It has completely changed the dynamics of our operations 


-  ,  An important and distinct property of living systems is the tenuous connection between cause and effect 


-  As most seasoned managers know ,  the best-laid plans are often perverted through self-interest ,  misinterpretation ,  or lack of necessary skills to reach the intended goal 


-   cumulative total of $3 billion  ( in 1997 dollars )  has been spent during the past 100 years to underwrite bounty hunters ,  field  sophisticated array of traps ,  introduce novel morsels of poisoned bait ,  and interject genetic technology  ( to limit fertility of females )   all with the aim of protecting sheep and cattle ranchers from these wily predators 


-  ,  As the tale of the coyote suggests ,  living systems are difficult to direct because of these weak cause-and-effect linkages 


-  The best laid efforts by man to intervene in  system ,  to do it harm ,  or even to replicate it artificially almost always miss the mark 


-  The cause-and-effect formula seemed simple:  (  )  identify  region with major universities with strong departments in such fields as microelectronics ,  genetics ,  and nuclear medicine and having  geography with climate and amenities suitable to attract professionals ,  and  (  )  invest to stimulate  self-reinforcing community of interests 


-  The cause-and-effect relationships proved unclear 


- 23  lot depends on chance 


-  One is wiser to acknowledge the broad possibilities that flow from weak cause-and-effect linkages and the need to consider the second- and third-order effects of any bold intervention one is about to undertake 


-  ,  In todays fast-changing environment ,  Shells Steve Miller dismisses the companys old traditional approach as mechanistic 


-  Experimentation ,  rapid learning ,  and seizing the momentum of success is the better approach 


-  Today ,  if youre going to have  successful company ,  you have to recognize that the top cant possibly have all the answers 


-  ,  Change your approach to strategy ,  and you change the way  company runs 


-  The leader becomes  context setter ,  the designer of  learning experience not an authority figure with solutions 


-  Once the folks at the grassroots realize they own the problem ,  they also discover that they can help create and own the answers ,  and they get after it very quickly ,  very aggressively ,  and very creatively ,  with  lot more ideas than the old-style strategic direction could ever have prescribed from headquarters 


-  ,  A program like this is  high-risk proposition ,  because it goes counter to the way most senior executives spend their time 


-   spend 50 percent to 60 percent of my time at this ,  and there is no direct guarantee that what Im doing is going make something happen down the line 


-  Its about rigorous ,  well-taught marketing concepts ,  combined with  strong process design ,  that enable front-line employees to think like businesspeople 


-  Top executives and front-line employees learn to work together in partnership 


-   encountered lots of thinly veiled skepticism: Did your net income change from last quarter because of this change process? These challenges create anxiety 


-  Instead ,  top executives and lower-level employees learn to work together in partnership 


-  But the process and behavior that drive authentic strategic change arent like that 


-  If that evaluation comes up negative ,  youve got  big-time problem 


-  You dont have the same kind of control that traditional leadership is used to 


-  You get more feedback than before ,  you learn more than before ,  you know more through your own people about whats going on in the marketplace and with customers than before 


-  ,  Millers words testify to his reconciliation with the weak cause-and-effect linkages that exist in  living system 


-  When strategic work is accomplished through  design for emergence ,  it never assumes that  particular input will produce  particular output 


-  It is more akin to the study of subatomic particles in  bubble chamber 


-  The experimenters design creates probabilistic occurrences that take place within the domain of focus
