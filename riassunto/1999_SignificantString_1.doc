-  Historically ,  they have served as  pervasive force for civilization ,  promoting honesty ,  trust ,  and respect for contracts 


-  Hero-worshipped by the few ,  they are deeply distrusted by the many 


-  ,  There is so much uncertainty about what companies represent that Bill Clinton in the United States and Tony Blair in the United Kingdom set up reviews of companies roles 


-  ,  People are right in their intuition that something is wrong 


-  The new role for management breaks from the narrow economic assumptions of the past to recognize that: ,  To understand why rethinking is necessary ,  start by looking at what happened to the corporate world in the 1980s 


-  ,  Are these exceptions that just prove the rule? Or do these companies know something that others dont? The answer is that they have escaped the deadly pincer of dominant theory and practice in which other companies are crushing themselves to bits 


-  Companies strive to seize and keep for themselves as much as they can of the value embodied in the products and services they deal with ,  while allowing as little of this value as possible to fall into the hands of others 


-  Employees ,  customers ,  suppliers ,  and direct or potential competitors are all trying to do the same thing 


-  The destruction of social welfare is not just  coincidental by-product of strategy; it is the fundamental objective of profit-seeking firms and ,  therefore ,  of their managers 


-  Why do companies exist? The answer provided by most economists is so straightforward that it appears compelling; companies exist simply because markets fail 


-  Accept this and its only  short step toward the dangerously misleading belief that markets represent some sort of ideal way to organize all economic activities 


-  In some of our dealings with others ,  particularly those requiring complex coordination of tasks ,  our opportunity to behave strategically is too great for markets to restrain 


-  The outlines are beginning to take shape of  different management model ,  based on  better understanding of both individual and corporate motivation 


-  If downsizing ,  cost-cutting ,  and getting lean and mean were the mantras of the past decade ,  the desire for growth and renewal will be the major concern of the next 


-  That is ,  most of their value is created not by individuals transacting individually in the market ,  as in the economists ideal ,  but by organizations involving people acting collectively ,  with their motives empowered and their actions coordinated by their companies purpose 


-  It exists precisely to provide  haven and  ( temporary )  respite from the laws of the market in which humans can combine to do something that markets arent very good at: innovating 


-  Their primary management focus was on value appropriation  not only vis--vis their customers and suppliers ,  but also vis--vis their own employees 


-  At Norton and Westinghouse ,  managers thought of their companies in market terms: they bought and sold businesses ,  created internal markets whenever they could ,  and dealt with their people with market rules 


-  Yet ,  they could not create any value that was new ,  not because they explicitly did not want to do so ,  but because the logic of the market that they adopted internally is simply not very good at anything other than enhancing the efficiency of existing activities 


-  The very sharp sense of self-interest these firms engendered ,  coupled with the uncertainties inherent in any innovative effort  ( both in terms of the size of any ultimate benefits and the distribution of those benefits )  made people unable to cooperate among themselves or to pool their resources and capabilities in order to create new combinations particularly ,  new combinations of knowledge and expertise  that most innovations require 


-  The managers primary task is redefined from institutionalizing control to embedding trust ,  from maintaining the status quo to leading change 


-  As opposed to being the designers of strategy ,  managers take on the role of establishing  sense of purpose within the company 


-  Defined in terms of how the company will create value for society ,  purpose allows strategy to emerge from within the organization ,  from the energy and alignment created by that sense of purpose 


-  The more specific the employees knowledge and skills are to  companys unique set of customers ,  technologies ,  equipment ,  and so on ,  the more productive they become and the more efficient the company becomes in all that it does 


-  One reason is the hyper-competition they have brought on themselves 


-  Paradoxically ,  the same forces of ferocious competition and turbulent change that make job security impossible also increase the need for trust and teamwork 


-  On the contrary ,  firms such as Intel and 3M have intuited that value creation demands something much more inspiring than individual self-interest:  community of purpose in which individuals can share resources ,  including knowledge ,  without knowing precisely how they will benefit ,  but confident of collective gain 


-  First ,  it is not  catchy new slogan to free managers from  sense of responsibility to protect the jobs of their staff 


-  At Intel ,  Andy Grove could make the kind of demands he did because his own past actions had established ,  beyond any doubt ,  the extent to which he was willing to go to protect the interests of his employees 


-  Rather ,  it must be inculcated as  very different philosophy  one that requires management at every level to work hard ,  on an ongoing basis ,  to create an exciting and invigorating work environment ,   place of enormous pride and satisfaction that bonds people to the company even more tightly than any bond of dependency that employment security could create 


-  But ,  by building the new company-employee relationship on  platform of mutual value-adding and continuous choice ,  rather than on  self-degrading acceptance of one-way dependence ,  the new contract is not just functional 


-  Canon made its own highly successful laser-printer technology obsolete by inventing and then promoting aggressively the bubble-jet printer on the ground that its functionality-to-cost ratio yielded higher value to customers 


-  Intel fueled the information revolution by relentlessly following Moores law ,  creating the next generation of chips that allowed its customers to do new things ,  while at the same time wiping out its earlier generation of products 


-  In each company ,  value creation was both the stated objective and the proven outcome 


-  The promise of employability is  big reason why fresh graduates worldwide seek to join these companies 


-  Furthermore ,  the company inherited adversarial relationships that extended to its suppliers and its customers ,  principal among them Rover ,  the  


-  We must create shared destiny relationships with all our stakeholders: customers ,  employees ,  suppliers ,  governments ,  and the communities in which we operate 


-  Rather ,  it was based on an expansive positive-sum value-creation perspective that we found much more typical of successful managers in the companies we have studied 


-  Their guilt lies in their unwillingness to confront explicitly the role their companies play in society or to articulate  moral philosophy for their own professions 


-  In the process ,  value was destroyed for all constituents ,  including customers ,  shareholders ,  and employees 


-  ,  In contrast ,  3M and Kao continue to grow profitably ,  spawning new products and businesses ,  creating customer satisfaction ,  employee enthusiasm ,  and shareholder wealth ,  and ABB continues to expand and strengthen its leadership position in its businesses ,  at times by acquiring the spent parts of companies like Westinghouse and rejuvenating them with the power of its very different philosophy 


-  ,  Ideas matter 


-  When the solution to  recurring problem is always try harder ,  there is usually something wrong with the terms ,  not the execution
