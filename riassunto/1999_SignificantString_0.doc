-  We have studied twenty chief knowledge officers  ( CKOs )  in North America and Europe both to understand their roles and to gain insight on evolving knowledge management practice 


-  Most of the CKOs we studied have little time for such conceptualization ,  but they agree on three points 


-  These include ,  for example ,  mutual sharing of knowledge with partners ,  allies ,  intermediaries ,  suppliers ,  and customers 


-  ,  Other than for reasons of curiosity ,  why study chief knowledge officers? Eight practical questions stand out: ,  Although ,  not surprisingly ,  we found differences in what CKOs did in their particular organizations ,  we found  remarkable similarity in their personal profiles and in their experiences to date 


-  In particular ,  CKOs have found they need to engage senior executives one on one to understand possible individual or local knowledge gaps or opportunities and to initiate customized knowledge management projects 


-  They have to believe theres something in it for them and that  care about that as much as they do 


-  In particular ,  they interact with four types of managers  ( see Figure  )  


-  They look for those who are excited about  particular knowledge management idea or project and thus have identified where improvement is possible and are likely to want to try something new 


-  They sense that in  new and as yet ill-defined corporate initiative ,  especially one with the CEOs personal  ( or idiosyncratic )  support ,  there will be doubters and reactionaries who must be converted to the cause or avoided for now 


-  In particular ,  they seek to encourage and facilitate conversations and unplanned or chance encounters 


-  As  technologist ,  the CKO has to understand which technologies can contribute to capturing ,  storing ,  exploring ,  and ,  in particular ,  sharing knowledge 


-  Thus the CKO has to be sufficiently informed about technology to evaluate what works ,  to judge when to adopt  technology ,  to appreciate the opportunities enabled ,  and to assess any demanding implementation issues 


-  And reengineering knowledge-intensive management and business processes ,  such as new product development or sales planning ,  often requires development of  knowledge-sharing IT application ,  such as groupware to record experiences and ideas or  database to work from agreed on or continuously updated know-how 


-  The CKO is therefore also an environmentalist ,  which implies several things 


-  For example ,  all those in different functions who serve key customers or have information on them may be brought together or connected in order to exchange knowledge  ( especially experience and gossip )  


-  So the CKO must be  self-starter who is excited by business development and by growing something 


-  The CKOs studied recognize the personal risks involved in taking on  newly created position ,  in particular ,  one whose label invites ridicule  ( although most valued having knowledge in their titles )  


-  To  degree ,  the CKO is  visionary ,  able to see the big picture that the CEO has in mind ,  but also able to translate it into action ,  to think of new ways of doing things and yet focus on deliverable results 


-  In short ,  the CKOs we have met are driven by building something and seeing it through 


-  He or she has to bring in ideas and seed them and listen to other peoples ideas and back them if they make sense and fit the knowledge vision 


-  At the same time ,  it is important to be able to read the companys appetite for change and appreciate how to connect to ,  and work along with ,  other change initiatives 


-  One CKO said she is driven to make  difference in performance ,  but added that such goals are to no avail unless the CKO understands the organizations business model and is clear on the kinds of knowledge that are relevant and will create value 


-  More particularly ,  the model in Figure  suggests distinct differences from other related jobs 


-  ,  If you are appointing  CKO ,  how do you know one when you see one? ,  As environmentalist and technologist ,   CKOs outlook or mindset needs to be broad 


-  The ambiguities of  new and ill-defined corporate role and the need to be seen as important by the CEO suggest that an executive who has  visible and successful track record of achievement but who also has further to go in the corporation is an ideal appointment 


-  Length of experience in the organization probably helps give credibility to the entrepreneurial and building aspects of the job ,  particularly if there is  visible record of past success 


-  ,  While the ideal rsum for  CKO seems to include breadth of career experience and familiarity with the organization ,  it is the personalities of the CKOs we studied that stand out 


-  Yet they seem not to mind who takes the credit for any successes ,  as long as the success is visible and can be attributed at least in part to the knowledge management program 


-  The relatively low score on emotionality indicates that CKOs are more likely to be even-tempered ,  optimistic ,  moderate ,  and more able to deal with stress and sensitive situations than average and are not likely to dwell on problems in  detrimental way 


-  The high ratings on openness suggest willingness to try new things or different approaches 


-  CKOs seem likely to be tolerant and consider issues on their own terms rather than adhering to fixed standards 


-  ,  The almost average rating for agreeableness suggests  propensity to vary behavior to meet the demands of  situation 


-  They trust others but also need to know others motives 


-  They are honest and considerate of others ,  with appropriate consideration of the needs of the individual 


-  CKOs seem likely to be cooperative in some circumstances and competitive in others 


-  ,   CEO or executive team needs to understand the level and nature of resources that  CKO requires to do his or her job 


-  ,  Current CKO budgets are small for three reasons: ,  First ,  ideally ,  any knowledge management projects or investments are corporately funded if enterprisewide and locally funded if at the business unit or individual level 


-  If the CEO changes his mind ,  Im dead ,  commented one CKO 


-  ,  There are ,  however ,  more subtle reasons for CEO support 


-  Two or three years into their jobs ,  they realize that they need more time than they first thought to promote and embed knowledge management 


-  And the CKOs studied now realize that some guarantee of multiyear funding is necessary to ensure that they can take substantive initiatives and see them through 


-  The CKO must make the senior executive team and prominent line managers believe in knowledge management   goal that is indivisible from winning and retaining personal trust 


-  Such trust may initially derive from the CKOs track record ,  but before long ,  it is sustained only by visible results 


-  Thus ,  on the one hand ,  the CKOs studied have little time for conceptualization and frameworks of knowledge; on the other hand ,  they back any idea that can be construed or interpreted as knowledge management ,  as long as it makes business sense 


-  Most managers will not argue against managing knowledge 


-  So almost all the CKOs studied have spent considerable time and effort identifying current business concerns and emerging value-creation initiatives and then connecting knowledge propositions to them 


-  ,  There are sufficient strategic reasons to suggest that knowledge management as  concept and practice will survive
