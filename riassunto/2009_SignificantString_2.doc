- At the A-list conferences on sustainability and business ,  Amory Lovins is the speaker whom all the other speakers mention from the stage 


-  Hes the touchstone  the talisman that others figuratively hold aloft in order to reaffirm their own sustainability bona fides and intellectual chops 


-  He sits in the front row ,  bespectacled and mild mannered ,  and mostly appears to be curious  about everything  and to have no time for fluff 


-  )  ,  Lovins has worked the intersection of sustainability and business for longer than most of us have known the intersection exists ,  along the way authoring dozens of books ,  including the pathbreaking Natural Capitalism  Creating the Next Industrial Revolution ,  and receiving  MacArthur Foundation genius grant 


-  ,  When audiences of organization leaders ask what you mean by sustainability ,  what do you tell them? ,  The question wouldnt arise because  dont use the word 


-  There are various standard definitions you can quote  ( Brundtland ,  Forum for the Future ,  etc 


-  ,  But behind your question is the core of something very important: the idea that doing business as if nature and people were properly valued actually creates stunning competitive advantage 


-  To put it another way ,  if capitalism is  productive use of and reinvestment in capital ,  we cant deal only with financial and physical capital  money and goods 


-  We also need to productively use and reinvest in the two more valuable kinds of capital  people and nature 


-  If you play with  full deck ,  using all four kinds of capital ,  then you make more money ,  do more good and have more fun 


-  ,  But our survey and others show that businesspeople dont generally believe that 


-  What do you find they do believe ,  when you first talk with them? What misconceptions about sustainability  by whatever name  do you find yourself having to correct? ,  Thats  more useful question 


-  ,  In business ,   love to have competitors who think that way  especially those who think that efficiency costs more or green costs more ,  because thats extremely rare in our experience 


-  And when we do new installations ,  we save more ,  typically 40% to 90% ,  but the capital cost almost always goes down 


-  Its certainly not the case in well-designed new buildings or factories ,  nor in most green vehicles ,  with modest exceptions 


-  In fact ,  in every factory we go into we find the floor lined with $10 , 000 bills 


-  ,  Why dont people pick up that money? What keeps companies from seizing opportunities that you describe as having no downside? ,  Well ,  it requires thought ,  which for some people is exhilarating and for others is painful 


-  It requires change  which requires relentless patience and meticulous attention to detail 


-  In other words ,  its the same as any other management innovation 


-  Its like deciding to have  safety culture or Six Sigma; you really have to pay attention to make it work 


-  It doesnt happen auto-magically because you issue  memo saying its  good idea 


-  ,  Company leaders often characterize the challenge  different way  they talk in terms of the business case for addressing sustainability 


-  In our survey ,  executives say that they cant figure out how to make the business case ,  even when theyre convinced conceptually that there should be competitive benefits 


-  When executives tell you they cant make the business case ,  what do you tell them? ,  If theyve read Natural Capitalism  ( free at www 


- org ,  along with an overview from Harvard Business Review )  and nothing occurs to them ,   sometimes suggest we spend  day together looking at their typical plants and operations ,  and something very interesting will turn up 


-  After all ,  Dow [Chemical] recently invested $1 billion to save $9 billion worth of energy so far ,  and when United Technologies started paying attention ,  they cut their energy intensity 45% in five years 


-  Or consider  very large beverage maker that could ,  we found together ,  make more money from something it was paying to throw away than from its main product  ( but it could continue making that money too )  


-  Typically ,  Principle Two comes next  making things the way nature does ,  with closed loops ,  no waste and no toxicity 


-  These shifts are both encouraged and rewarded by Principle Three ,  the solutions economy business model 


-  Some firms have good opportunities when they follow Principle Four  reinvesting some of the resulting profits into the kinds of capital were shortest of ,  especially nature 


-  ,  Is there particular information that companies need to collect  and understand  in order to construct the business case that will argue for investment? ,  Yes 


-  In many plants that the owners think are running well ,  one can stand in the doorway and see 50% to 75% savings waiting to be exploited 


-  For now ,  dont worry about whether you have enough capital to exploit them; the capital can be found if theres  good business case 


-  ,  What do companies get wrong about this process? Are there common mistakes that ,  if avoided ,  would make the business case much easier to build? ,  The most pervasive mental handicap under which most executives labor is the assumption that  very efficient building or factory must cost more ,  probably  lot more ,  up front 


-  With good design ,  its capital cost will generally go down ,  not up ,  so questions about discount rates and payback periods wont even arise 


-  ,  Many CEOs ,  astonishingly ,  confuse their top and bottom lines 


-  million  year to our bottom line 


-  But in the next breath ,  he added ,  I cant get excited about saving energy ,  though  its only  few percent of my cost of doing business 


-   had to do the arithmetic and show him that if ,  hypothetically ,  he achieved the same result in his 90-odd-million square feet of facilities worldwide ,  his total net that year would rise by 56% 


-  That got his attention! The great engineer was quickly promoted and spread his practices all over the company 


-  ,  Another common error is to tell the shop floor engineers to meet  12- or 18-month simple payback on energy efficiency ,  even though the payback implied by the firms IRR or ROI discounted cash flow hurdle rate is many times longer 


-  In such cases  try to get the comptroller and the engineers to sit together with  graph translating between their respective metrics  then maybe theyll stop misallocating capital 


-  ,  What other counterproductive managerial assumptions do you encounter? ,  Most executives assume that energy and other resources will be used optimally without being well measured and without accountabilities and rewards 


-  )  Hence RMIs effort to overhaul engineering pedagogy and practice  ( www 


-  ,  The list goes on like this ,  but these examples may suggest the richness of the opportunity when one really pays attention 


-  You discuss the business case in terms of resource efficiency or building and process design or financial strategy 


-  You dont make  case for addressing sustainability 


-  ,   think the key is to not try to make  business case for addressing sustainability 


-  Instead ,  create  robust business strategy that takes into account all four kinds of capital but leads you to actions that youd wisely undertake even if you had no environmental concern 


-  Think about it: You dont want to make your business depend on  random variable ,  like oil prices ,  as the automakers have discovered 


-  And you dont want to make your business depend on the availability of something thats insecure ,  like fossil fuels or water ,  or things that can create conflict 


-  You dont want to have those embarrassing conversations with OSHA or the EPA ,  so its better to design out of your process anything that can harm the workers or the neighbors 


-  ,  This goes back to the question about common misconceptions 


-  The social and market forces that are demanding and receiving such amazing innovation in technology design and competitive strategy can all be phrased in different ways depending on what youre personally worried about 


-  Whether youre driven by environmental issues or national security issues or competitiveness and profit issues ,  you can still end up doing precisely the same things 


-  ,  So you think strategy ought to be formed in ways that dont require somebody to be invested in protecting the environment ,  just invested in making smart strategy? ,   wouldnt put it quite that way 


-  Often people do come for help because of environmental concerns ,  but if they do ,  Ill say ,  Well ,  heres how to do what you want ,  and by the way ,  itll be extremely profitable  much better than your present business and more robust and secure 


-  If they are concerned about ,  say ,  national security ,  Ill say ,  Oh ,  by the way ,  this also has these economic and environmental benefits 


-  If they have  truly narrow bottom line approach ,  Ill say ,  Boy ,  are you going to make  lot of money off of this 


-  And by the way ,  it will also have security and environmental benefits 


-  ,  Indeed ,  energy efficiency is an interesting example ,  because besides being very profitable in private internal cost ,  it often has side benefits that are worth one or two orders of magnitude more than the saved energy 


-  An efficient data center will have an order of magnitude better uptime 


-  Oh ,  and since in  typical office you pay 164 times as much for people as for energy ,  if you had   


- 6% or so gain in labor productivity ,  that would have the same bottom line effect as making your energy bill zero 


- 6% but about 6% to 16% ,  there are one to one-and-a-half orders of magnitude greater bottom line benefits from labor productivity than from the energy savings themselves ,  even if the energy savings were 100% 


-  ,  Are there other rewards that you think companies addressing sustainability will experience  regardless of their angle of entry? ,  Anybody who runs such  company is likely to tell you that their biggest win is in recruiting ,  retaining and motivating the best people 


-  Take an example like Wal- ,  Mart ,  which you would perhaps not normally think of in terms of talent competition; its not like  high-tech or financial services company 


-  And yet ,  once the associates realized that what the company was up to and what they were being personally invited to take responsibility for would make their communities better and their families healthier and give more meaning to their lives ,  they grabbed the initiative with such enthusiasm that one of the officers in charge of the greening of Wal-Mart told me about  year ago ,  It feels like Im hanging on to  few hairs coming out the end of the tail of  powerful tiger thats bounding off in all directions; Im hanging on for dear life trying to learn fast enough to steer this critter that we have somehow mobilized beyond our wildest dreams 


-  What have you seen happen to  businesss external relationships? ,  They gain an obvious advantage simply from this: If you want to succeed in any business ,  you have to be the kind of business people want to do business with and feel good about 


-  Conversely ,  if you screw up ,  especially environmentally and increasingly now in social issues ,  you will lose your franchise ,  your social license to operate ,  and then youre dead 


-  Which means we have to keep asking ,  what prevents organizations from adopting them? Youve already mentioned the odd combination of zeal and patience that any sort of major change requires ,  and weve explored the challenges of the business case 


-  What else gets in the way? ,  Arrogance 


-   culture thats hermetic and not properly permeable to outside ideas  especially if the ideas come from people who are different or are ideas that people in the organization disagree with 


-  Its  way of learning 


-  Theres  line  love from Judy Brown ,  in  Leaders Guide to Reflective Practice ,  that proposes we ask ourselves whenever we fail to connect with someone ,  What is it about me that makes me unable to learn from this person? ,  Or as my wife Judys late father ,  an ex-Marine ,  used to say in his later years ,  I dont like that man 


-  ,  Whats an example of how those mind-set barriers keep businesses from seeing their opportunities or threats? ,  Im having this difficulty at the moment working with senior people in the nuclear power industry 


-  Im trying to help them understand who their competitors are ,  who supply more energy than they do and are growing tens of times faster because theyre cheaper and have less financial risk ,  but the nuclear industrys theology says these are not real competitors; theyre not legitimate; they cant amount to much 


-  ,  The power of accepted models? ,  Paradigms hold immense sway over our minds 


-  Youve talked often about system problems  such as in the energy or health care markets ,  among many  in which all the incentives are misaligned in ways that discourage efficiency 


-  Do you believe that individual companies can achieve competitive advantage even when working against an ill-conceived system? ,  Absolutely 


-  My own view of  sound national energy policy is that all ways to save or produce energy should be allowed and required to compete fairly at honest prices ,  regardless of their type ,  technology ,  size ,  location or ownership 


-  ,  But customers are not simply stuck with the resulting offers from various monopolists and monopsonists 


-  If you dont like the kind of officially sanctioned and subsidized energy supply youre offered ,  you can bypass the whole system by buying your own efficiency and ,  increasingly ,  renewables 


-  ,  Are there particular organizational capabilities or attributes that you think companies need to cultivate in order to be able to capitalize on sustainability-related opportunities? ,  Ive already mentioned humility 


-  Anderson says ,  the summit is really high and encased in swirling mists 


-  We know which way is up ,  he says ,  and you get there  step at  time  which  think is  much wiser approach than the usual hoopla 


-  If youre  company that sticks to its knitting ,  minds its own business and doesnt pay attention to whats happening in the world around you ,  youre probably riding for  fall and missing some big business opportunities ,  because in any business  can think of  including all of them in the 30 sectors weve worked in so far  its the hidden connections between your business and other opportunities that you think are well outside your boundaries that create extraordinary opportunity or risk ,  depending on the way you handle them 


-  ,  This is another way of saying that you need  really wide-angle lens 


-  You can still have  sharp focus ,  but you sure need peripheral vision
