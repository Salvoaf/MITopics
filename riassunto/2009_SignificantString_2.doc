- attributed to Winston Churchill ,  Its the question everyone wants answered: Why did so many smart people miss the signs of the collapse of the subprime market? As early as 2001 ,  there were many danger signals about the impending housing bubble and the rampant use of derivatives 


-  Some players were more prescient ,  however ,  and sensed as well as acted on the early warning signals 


-  ,  So ,  what separates the prescient few from the hapless horde? Did the siren call of outsize profits and bonuses ,  coupled with the delusional promises of manageable risk ,  dull the senses? Was the ability to see sooner and more clearly compromised by information overload ,  organizational filters and cognitive biases that afflict sense making in all organizations? Economist Robert Shiller of Yale University ,   leading housing expert ,  recently invoked groupthink to explain why the Federal Reserve didnt take the early warning signs of  looming housing bubble more seriously 


-  Our own research suggest that fewer than 20% of global companies have sufficient capacity to spot ,  interpret and act on the weak signals of forthcoming threats and opportunities 


-  Our approach addresses the cognitive biases organizations may not be aware of ,  yet need to overcome 


-  In addition ,  there are organizational biasessuch as groupthink or polarizationthat may keep much of the periphery-dwelling enemy in the shadows ,  even in organizations with an active scanning process 


-  The decision-making literature identifies many of the human weaknesses that impair our sense-making skills 


-  Even for scholars ,  however ,  it is difficult at times to untangle the knot of factors that clogged  decision-making process 


-  Among them: incomplete data analysis by key engineers  (  cognitive failure )  stress-induced groupthinka bias that values consensus above independent thinkingcaused by deadlines and isolation  (  group-dynamic explanation )  and organizational values that gradually normalized danger beyond the point of prudence  (  cultural or institutional explanation )  


-  )  Humans tend to judge too quickly when presented with ambiguous data; we have to work extra hard to consider less familiar scenarios 


-  ,  Whenever multiple pieces of evidence point in opposite directions ,  or when crucial information is missing ,  our minds naturally shape the facts to fit our preconceptions 


-  ,  Although complete objectivity is elusive ,  managers need to be aware of well-established traps that underlie human inference and judgment 


-  If something doesnt fit our mental model ,  we often distort reality to make it fit rather than challenge our fundamental assumptions 


-   related phenomenon is suppression or the refusal to acknowledge an unpleasant reality because it is too discordant 


-  One well-known bias is rationalization: interpreting evidence in  way that sustains  desired belief 


-  Wishful thinking leads us to see the world only in  pleasing way ,  denying subtle evidence that  child is abusing drugs or  spouse is being unfaithful 


-  Another common interpretation bias is egocentrism ,  according to which we overemphasize our own role in the events we seek to explain 


-  This self-serving tendency is related to the fundamental attribution bias ,  which causes us to ascribe more importance to our own actions than to those of others or the environment 


-  Over time ,  our opinions may become frozen and our attitudes hardened as we immunize ourselves from contradictory evidence 


-  Indeed ,  we may even engage in selective memory and forget those inconvenient facts that dont fit the overall picture 


-  The hindsight bias similarly distorts our memories such that our original doubts are erased 


-  ,  In addition to our personal biases ,  we function in organizations as well and may end up suffering from what social psychologist Irving Janis termed groupthink 


-  But often  group can fall victim to narrow-minded analysis ,  tunnel vision ,   false sense of consensus and poor information gathering ,  resulting in groupthink 


-  The true relevance of various snippets of information often can be fully appreciated only when they are debated with others and merged into  larger mosaic 


-  State Department ,  were streaming into various parts of the government bureaucracy ,  which did not have the necessary means to make sense of it all 


-  Some signals were dismissed at the local level and simply not transmitted; some were shared as fragments that remained unconnected to other pieces of the puzzle 


-  ,  Organizational sense making occurs in  complex social environment in which people are not just sensitive to what is being said ,  but also to who is speaking 


-  Source credibility is influenced by many factors ,  including status ,  past experience ,  politics and the like 


-  Since most managers receive information from multiple sources ,  they need to be aware of such biases 


-  But how these different perspectives are cultivated and connected will greatly affect the ability of the organization to make sense of the weak information it receives 


-  How can management learn to overcome biases to improve their sense making? There are nine proven approaches that managers can use actively to reveal ,  amplify and clarify potentially important weak signals 


-  Likewise ,  organizations may wish to drive more of their sense making to local levels 


-  Terrorist networks have demonstrated the deadly power and resiliency of such an approach ,  using nearly autonomous cells that see and think locally 


-  ,  showing how its innovations in biological compounds were related to  series of complex ,  evolving networks of scientific ,  governmental and medical institutions 


-  Organizational sense making is usually driven toward  single interpretation ,  so new data are force-fit into the existing mental model 


-  However ,  organizations need competing hypotheses to escape the trap of getting stuck on  simple ,  single view that is wrong 


-  The red team is  parallel task force ,  made up of senior leaders and support staff ,  whose only mission is to collect and synthesize information to prove that the current plan is wrong and needs to be changed 


-  The red team approach requires  judicious balance between the doubt necessary to challenge false assumptions and the conviction or courage needed to pursue  bold course of action in the face of challenge and opposition 


-  This balance can occur only if the underlying theme is that strategic surprise is inevitable and midcourse corrections are often necessary when facing the unknown 


-  To handle the dangers of groupthink or the problem of distributed intelligence  ( where key information is dispersed around the organization )  ,  managers may wish to pay more attention to the grapevine 


-  One way to avoid collective myopia is to create anonymous opinion markets 


-  asked employees to participate in  newly created opinion market to forecast its sales 


-  ,  By considering multiple scenarios at the same time ,  the organization can keep from being locked into one view of what future might emerge and yet share  common set of frameworks for discussing new signals 


-  Also ,  they wanted software that wasnt proprietary ,  since IBM and Hitachi Ltd 


-  Once Tucci recognized the new reality ,  he understood how the company needed to transform 


-  Paasikivi  ( 1870-1956 )  ,  is engraved with his motto that All wisdom starts by recognizing the facts 


-  This is especially difficult when not all the facts are known and subject to interpretation 


-  Wisdom requires constructive conflict to ascertain and interpret the facts as they are 


-  But the conflict must be among ideas ,  not people ,  and remain within reason 


-  Experienced managers often possess far more knowledge than they realize ,  especially when operating within their domains of expertise 


-  Unlike humans ,  organizations can draw upon more than two eyes to make sense of what theyre seeing 


-  )  gave it an early window on telematics technology ,  and the company had reason to believe that there was  market for it 


-  In 1995 ,  GM had commissioned  study to look at the key factors influencing consumers decisions to purchase an automobile 


-  The study revealed 26 factors ,  which were ranked according to their importance to customers current satisfaction 


- 27 GM found that while customers were very satisfied with how its products met their need for mobility ,  four factors revealed important unmet consumer needs:  (  )  personal attention ,  (  )  limited time and energy ,  (  )  privacy and  (  )  personal safety 


- 28 With insights into the desire of customers for personal attention and safety ,  as well as an understanding of the emerging technology ,  GM managers were able to spot an opportunity at the intersection 


-  Managers seeking to understand an emerging technology might use analogies to markets for technologies with similar characteristics 


-  But these analogies distort ,  because the situations may not be comparable in critical but unknown respects 


-  Considering the high ambiguity surrounding the signal ,  the company decided to track the development of remote electronic printing of newspapers 


-  While such scenario-based analysis doesnt eliminate the uncertainty about either the development of the technology or consumer acceptance ,  it can help managers make better sense when one small piece of information is added to the puzzle  ( such as\nXeroxs minor announcement about remote printing options )  


- 30 ,  By looking closely at its customers and competitors ,   company that owned  major carpet manufacturing business forced its management team to face up to so many unpleasant realities that it walked away from the business 


-  They verify  weak signals strategic import ,  and help to compensate for known deficiencies in our individual and collective vision 


-  When ambiguity is high ,  we can easily torture the weak data until it confesses to whatever we want to believe
