-  The problem is that there is little evidence to support these new approaches 


-  We are not specifically arguing in favor of traditional ratings ,  nor do we believe most legacy performance and feedback systems are built to address todays talent management challenges 


-  The answer to complexity is not oversimplification; the right process is the one that leverages the known facts about what drives performance 


-  Today ,  HR too often ignores these facts ,  instead chasing bright ,  shiny objects ,  what John Boudreau and Steven Rice have referred to as flavor-of-the-day HR novelties 


-  1: Its  problem that employees dont like formal performance feedback 


-  Yes ,  there is certainly evidence that people dont like feedback 


-  An employees satisfaction with feedback has  powerful mediating impact on performance; if he or she is dissatisfied with feedback ,  other performance factors ,  such as accountability or confidence in performing the task ,  plummet 


-  And regardless of how happy you are ,  addressing the problem is the best possible outcome 


-  The risk of this approach is that leaders avoid giving feedback ,  or sugarcoat it to the point that it has no practical value ,  or simply deliver it poorly 


-  Studies show that positive feedback may lead to  decrease in effort ,  just as negative feedback may boost ones desire to achieve more 


-  Also ,  receiving only positive feedback keeps people from taking in negative feedback long term 


-  An experimental study of strategic decision-makers showed that resting on the laurels of past successes and consistently getting only positive feedback will impede people from listening to negative feedback in the future ,  when it may actually be needed to correct  faulty course of action 


-  Several factors should be taken into consideration to match the right message with the right person in  concrete situation 


-  For instance ,  motivation improves both when positive feedback is given to people with  promotion focus  ( those who want to achieve and take risk ,  who are sensitive to rewards )  and when negative feedback is given to people with  prevention focus  ( those who want to avoid trouble and are generally cautious ,  who are sensitive to punishment )  


-  Negative feedback can be especially beneficial in critical events  novel ,  uncertain ,  first-time situations when the individual cares deeply about the outcome ,  such as leading  new team or managing  crisis 


-  Yet  blanket belief that bad feedback is bad aligns with most peoples desire to avoid conflict 


-   study at  large Midwestern university demonstrated that there is  tipping point at which an increase in feedback frequency leads to  decrease in task effort and performance 


-   study conducted  few years ago tells us that too much feedback can be particularly harmful at the early learning stage 


-  Of course ,  this is only one study 


-  Yet its  helpful reminder that not all our long-held assumptions may be correct  and our mistaken assumptions may come back to haunt us if we hinge business decisions on them 


-  There are notable examples of companies that take  comprehensive view of performance management and the role of feedback 


-  Facebook is one of them 


-  Refusing to board the abandon-the-ratings bandwagon ,  the company published the article Lets Not Kill Performance Evaluations Yet 


-  Most HR leaders would accept this as fact 


-  Yet if there is lack of trust in the manager-employee relationship ,  the weight of the feedback decreases dramatically 


-  We learned from  study of bank workers that source credibility  trust in the person giving feedback  strongly correlates with perceived accuracy and with  desire to respond ,  both of which have an impact on performance 


- 12 When trust and engagement with managers are low ,  feedback wont drive the desired outcomes 


-  HR must then look for alternative sources of feedback ,  such as  360-degree assessment ,  because feedback from  low-credibility leader wont change anything 


-  For this myth to become truth ,  the manager has to deliver quality feedback that takes into account  variety of factors  ( such as task ,  context ,  and personal characteristics )  and synthesizes them into an appropriate message 


-  Such  message could ,  in fact ,  be  performance rating 


-  When people dont know how they objectively compare with others ,  they are less likely to put in discretionary effort 


- 14  rating is  helpful mechanism to ensure consistency in delivering the organizational message to the individual about the level of performance relative to expectations 


-  Even those managers who indicate they know what to say to help employees develop ,  and how to say it ,  need  support process to guide them 


-  Out of 500 managers surveyed globally ,  about  third confessed that they did not know how to help people change ,  and less than 10% said they knew how to make such behavioral change sustainable 


-  For example ,  CEB Inc 


-  Oversimplifying performance management in times when the managers need structure most is hardly responsible 


-  ,  Changes to performance management that respond to just one or two chosen facts ,  while ignoring the complexity of human performance ,  waste an opportunity to drive individual performance and organizational success 


-  ,  The examples above indicate the complexity of performance management and the dangers of relying on buzzwords and sound bites to redesign processes 


-  We know that feedback is  key component in gaining this self-awareness ,  and self-aware people are more successful 


-  In their seminal book The Leadership Machine ,  Mike Lombardo and Bob Eichinger outline six key sources of personal growth ,  and feedback is one of them 


- 18 Of course ,  other individual and organizational aspects contribute ,  such as  feedback-rich environment and the individuals desire to engage in the conversation ,  and we must embrace this multidimensionality 


-  Improving feedback is not only about training managers ,  but also about organizational culture ,   sharp focus on performance ,  and holding leaders accountable for people development 


-  ,  Understanding what good feedback looks like ,  and how it can be delivered ,  will help win over even the most feedback-averse manager 


-  ,  We think of feedback as an investment of time and resources: Bad investments destroy value ,  good investments add value ,  and the best investments create sustainable value 


-  How does HR make feedback  best investment? ,  Create an approach that links feedback to the business strategy or company philosophy 


-  When giving feedback ,  take time to explain how the business is doing 


- 19 And what are better words to describe the current business environment than complex and nonlinear? ,  Ensure your system focuses on performance first ,  development second 


-  Focusing on performance goals gets people to act more quickly and with more zeal than  personal development target does 


-  While the managers main goal is to increase performance ,  the positioning of feedback works best when it contains the expectation of change and when it provokes the recipient to think in terms of  learning goal ,  such as ,  Yes ,   am keen to know how to design responsive web pages 


-  In one study ,   group of students were given two challenging tasks separated by  period of time 


-  They received feedback on how well they performed the first time around 


-  Those with  proving-goal orientation  ( for example ,  I must prove  am worthy of  promotion or I must do better than George on this )  did worse 


- 22 ,  Employee satisfaction with feedback creates  virtuous circle 


-  When employees receive feedback that they perceive to be valuable and intended to help them improve ,  other factors of performance are unlocked: utility  ( I believe feedback will help me achieve my goals )  ,  accountability  ( I ought to do my job well )  ,  self-efficacy  ( I am able to perform the task )  ,  and social awareness  ( I take others opinions of my work seriously )  


-  Giving employees feedback on how their behaviors help or hamper their ability to achieve the desired business outcomes will be more effective and position them for success in the future 


-  The nature of derailers  behaviors that impede success  is such that most people are either unaware of theirs or unable to control them without help 


-  Focusing only on strengths can be detrimental to individuals careers ,  as organizations are quite unforgiving about limitations  managers deselect for things that people are not good at 


- 25 Delivering performance feedback in  manner that helps the employee realize his or her own nonproductive behaviors leads to  better mood at work ,  greater job satisfaction ,  and stronger organizational commitment 


-   study was conducted with two groups of students taking part in  computer simulation 


-  One group received generic feedback on their people management decisions ,  and the other got more specific feedback 


-  For specificity ,  point out the exact behaviors that need to be improved ,  using facts and concrete situations from the recent past ,  and relate them to customer or peer feedback ,  if available 


-  To switch to the more generic level ,  ask open-ended questions  ( Changing which one behavior will make the biggest difference for your results? )  ,  link individual results with the companys strategy ,  or encourage employees to compare their performance with that of the best in the company and the industry 


-  There are moments in life when less is more 


-  Choose one or two critical points to deliver and focus on those 


-  Being structured and focused helps 


-  It encourages feedback that is structured ,  and drives consistency both vertically within  department or  division and horizontally across the organization 


-  It makes it easy for leaders to identify and prioritize behaviors ,  by restricting feedback to critical points or limiting feedback to selected behaviors 


-  They must consider the complexity of the operating environment ,  the adversity of situations ,  and the support that has or has not been provided to help employees attain their goals 


-  We call these factors feedback modifiers 


-  They complicate the job of delivering accurate and useful feedback ,  but they are essential to how the employee will see the credibility of the feedback provider and to the accuracy of the feedback 


-  The fact that this adds complexity is why those who lead others are paid  premium 


-  Managerial discretion is part of performance evaluation and ,  we believe ,  usually  positive aspect 


- 30 Managerial discretion also enables leaders to take account of everything that determines performance ,  including mitigating factors that would rightly impact perceptions of fairness 


-  However ,  this same discretion can have negative consequences  through managers unconscious biases or more malevolent factors ,  such as the politics of the organization 


- 31 ,  These noise factors can make it hard to provide fair ,  consistent ,  and useful feedback 


-  Examples of noise include: ,  When managers have the right understanding of feedback ,  their job becomes much easier 


-  We change and update our views about how the world works all the time 


-   danger of that is that we are likely to be drawn to bright ,  shiny objects or trends du jour; psychologists call these salience and recency effects 


-  HR must help organizations and their leaders guard against such cognitive biases and work hard on building beliefs based on scientific evidence 


-  ,  GEs Jack Welch once said ,  As  manager ,  you owe candor to your people , 33 and collectively we need to do  better job at enabling better ,  more candid feedback 


-  But ,  of course ,  it takes two to tango ,  and it may be unfair to lay blame on managers alone 


-  All of these ,  too ,  are the managers job to address by  surprise!  giving timely and accurate feedback 


-  ,  We conclude that  lack of honest ,  focused ,  and timely performance feedback is  major constraint to organizational performance 


-  Unfortunately ,  we see too many examples of HR ignoring the difficult facts in favor of simplistic ,  flavor-of-the-month solutions that will only make matters worse 


-  Lombardo and Eichinger ,  experts on derailment ,  put it in no uncertain terms: Getting no developmental feedback or feedback on strengths alone are time bombs which explode in managerial and executive roles 


- 35 It is HRs job to take on the difficult challenge of instilling  robust and comprehensive approach to feedback and performance management that fits the particular needs of the organization 


-  The approach must give managers the tools to truly improve  companys performance and give employees the path to self- and career improvement
