-  ,  But whats at the heart of credibility? Two critical elements: perceived competence  ( peoples faith in the leaders knowledge ,  skills ,  and ability to do the job )  and trustworthiness  ( their belief in his or her values and dependability )  


-  These behaviors include knowing oneself ,  appreciating ones constituents ,  affirming shared values ,  developing new capabilities ,  serving  purpose ,  and sustaining hope 


-  From this work  ( see About the Research )  ,  we have gleaned the following insights into what causes leaders to gain or lose credibility with their employees and what leaders who have lost credibility can do to regain it 


-  ,  Based on input from employees we surveyed from  range of organizations ,  we found that leaders are perceived as competent when they place an emphasis on the future ,  on organizational outcomes ,  and on employees ,  as well as when they take action and launch initiatives ,  communicate effectively ,  and gain knowledge and experiences 


-  Another way is to demonstrate sophisticated knowledge of industry trends and clear ideas about how the organization should respond to them 


-  ,   sense of competence is enhanced when leaders work consistently to improve organizational structures and processes and maintain fiscally sound operations 


-  This sentiment was reinforced by more than 60% of our respondents ,  who told us that they saw leaders as competent when they were action-oriented and aggressive ,  when they took on issues or projects that needed to be addressed ,  and when they werent afraid to make tough decisions 


-  By preemptively looking out for stakeholders needs ,  executives can prevent stakeholder conflicts and organizational crises ,  as well as gain the trust of key stakeholder groups 


-  ,  While prior research was less focused on factors that cause leaders to lose their credibility ,  employees in our field studies identified  number of red flags in both the competence and trustworthiness categories 


-  More than 80% of our respondents told us they view their top managers as incompetent when they display  lack of relevant job knowledge 


-  Although people often assume that leaders are selected because of their knowledge ,  skills ,  and abilities ,  this isnt always the case 


-  An extreme example of this is Tony Hayward ,  BPs CEO during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill ,  who during the crisis repeatedly showed  lack of understanding of the accidents causes and severity and its devastating social and environmental consequences 


-  So it makes sense that more than 70% of our respondents told us that they seriously question the competency of leaders who fail to take action or ignore problems 


-  Sometimes leaders do this without realizing it; sometimes they misrepresent the facts by trying to put  positive spin on difficult situations 


-  ,  Another behavior that undermines  sense of competence is giving contradictory information 


-  Such seemingly extraneous requests can cause confusion as to what the organizations priorities are ,  and employees may feel resentful about what they see as  waste of their time 


-  We identified several behaviors that one might think leaders would realize are detrimental and avoid doing 


-  In fact ,  our respondents mentioned these behaviors frequently ,  with more than 80% indicating that the behaviors were very suggestive of an untrustworthy leader 


-  ,  Dishonest communication is another seemingly obvious way leaders hurt their trustworthiness 


-  This goes beyond trying to paint something in the most favorable light possible 


-  ,  Leaders who openly ignore the opinions of employees and key stakeholders are also perceived as untrustworthy 


-  Specific examples given by our respondents include making unilateral decisions and casually rejecting others requests without due consideration 


- 11 They believe that incompetent leaders can at least try to become more competent ,  whereas untrustworthy leaders cant easily become more trustworthy 


-  Next ,  we will share  few insights from our analysis so that leaders will better understand how to avoid losing credibility or ,  if theyve already lost it ,  how to get it back 


-  More often ,  though ,  behaviors that cause employees to perceive senior managers as competent or trustworthy arent inversely related to those that convey incompetence or untrustworthiness 


-  So its important to consider the full range of indicators when trying to gauge how others see you as  leader 


-  Scholars who study trust have found that people tend to weigh positive information more heavily than negative information with regard to competence 


-  Partly for that reason ,  its more difficult to regain credibility once its lost than to build credibility in the first place 


-  However ,  James Gorman ,  CEO of Morgan Stanley ,  took the opportunity to thoroughly review the companys practices regarding compensation ,  compliance ,  and risk management 


-  They also need to overcome negative expectations that stem from their incompetent and untrustworthy behaviors by emphasizing the specific behaviors that project competence and trustworthiness
