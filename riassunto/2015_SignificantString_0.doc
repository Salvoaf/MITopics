-  Gabriels team doesnt always understand the trade-offs she has to make  decisions to support global brands inevitably take away from local initiatives 


-   need to help my people see how the pieces of the puzzle fit together 


-  ,  Gabriel is  sterling example of an enterprise leader  an executive who is as successful at serving the needs of the enterprise as she is at growing the unit she heads  and CEOs want more leaders like her 


-  ,  The reasons are obvious 


-  Customers increasingly want integrated solutions instead of products ,  so different business units need to work together seamlessly 


-  The expectation that managers will know whats happening elsewhere in the enterprise is rising ,  in part because new competitors can appear out of nowhere 


-  )  What we found was that ,  regardless of the business or the location ,  enterprise leaders developed their capabilities in similar ways  through  combination of deliberate personal development ,  high-level mentoring ,  and opportunities afforded by their work that enabled strong unit performers to become even more effective as enterprise leaders 


-  ,  The essence of enterprise leadership lies in the need to combine two often incompatible roles  those of builder and broker 


-  We are not talking about either-or propositions: Rather ,  enterprise leaders must excel at being both advocacy-oriented builders and integration-minded brokers 


-  That means they need to build their units vision and integrate it into the wider corporate vision ,  clarifying where the enterprise is going and how their teams can best contribute ,  both within and beyond unit ,  geographic ,  and functional boundaries 


-  They must build unit capabilities and share resources and business know-how across units to contribute to enterprisewide organizational capability 


-  They need to reconcile their teams passion for fulfilling their units mission with  sense of responsibility and accountability for the success of the enterprise as  whole 


-  When he learned that Pfizers team for marketing its blood thinner Eliquis in Japan needed additional support in optimizing the marketing plan and determining how to focus the teams talent ,  Gladstone decided to shift  star member of his own team to the Japanese project ,  even though he had no responsibility for or direct stake in the Japanese units success 


-  With this move ,  he was demonstrating an enterprise mindset   willingness to take  hit on his short-term performance for the benefit of Pfizer as  whole 


-  But ,  at the same time ,  when it becomes clear that it is time to shut down  project in order to redirect resources to more promising therapies ,   need to drive home that under those circumstances we are Pfizer first and unit second 


- 10 But Raffins responsibility is to make sure that Frye can thrive in  competitive market where direct online selling is the norm 


-  Designers put their heart and soul into creating beautiful products that are then subjected to the commercialization process ,  which ,  if not properly managed ,  can significantly alter the products aesthetic ,  said Raffin ,  adding that rewarding cross-functional teams with performance bonuses greatly aids in the companys ability to promote both the need to understand and the need to feel understood 


- 11 ,  And yet when we asked company leaders and HR professionals about the obstacles to developing enterprise leaders ,  they focused not on the challenges of the job itself but on organizational barriers 


-  Most people came up the ranks in silos ,  so they didnt feel the impetus to change; the assumption was that if you hit your numbers you would be left alone 


-  ,  What this told us was that organizations were set up to develop strong building skills  and not the brokering skills so many of the top leaders we talked to told us they needed 


-  Pfizers Gladstone suggested that the earlier one can plant the seeds of an enterprise mindset ,  the better 


-  Even if people do not ultimately become senior leaders ,  its helpful for them to think broadly ,  he noted 


-  Every colleague in the organization ,  no matter how narrowly focused their role ,  should be thinking about the enterprise and how what they are doing is ultimately helping the patients that we serve 


-  Its  matter of developing  mindset ,  really   way of thinking about the world around you 


-  ,  All of the leaders we spoke with indicated that they were already accomplished builders ,  but mastery of the brokering role is highly dependent on cultivating  new mindset thats suited to living with the tensions inherent in the job 


-  After analyzing the responses from our interviews ,  we identified six components of the mindset of the successful enterprise leader:  heightened sense of place;  broad sense of context;  sharp sense of perspective;  powerful sense of community;  deep sense of purpose; and an abiding sense of resiliency 


-  These leaders were not born with such  mindset; they learned how to develop it 


-  ,  The enterprise leaders we talked to told us that  series of learning opportunities served as enablers for them to develop what we refer to as the six senses of the enterprise leaders mindset 


-  They appreciated the companys essential identity  so much so that they could tell stories about how the identity served as  source of competitive advantage 


- 12 For Li  Fungs Raffin ,  for instance ,  that identity meant understanding and respecting Fryes deep history of craftsmanship and what owning  pair of its boots meant to customers 


-  For Unilevers Gabriel ,  it meant having  deep understanding of both Unilevers global reach and what the local products meant to the companys competitiveness 


-  In the minds of enterprise leaders ,  the things the company sells are more than products 


-  ,  The enterprise leaders developed this sense of place primarily by absorbing the corporate culture 


-  ,  But it was what the top executives did ,  even more than what they said ,  that established the sense of place for enterprise leaders 


-  They are big believers in building lean ,  fast ,  and agile operations; yet ,  at the same time ,  they are also big believers in the importance of cultural integration ,  of knowledge sharing ,  and of stressing the importance that Li  Fungs many local entrepreneurs develop  passion for contributing their know-how to the groups ambitions 


-  The point here is not just that the two top executives believe in the dual role; in observing them ,  Rana realized: If they can act this way ,  why shouldnt I? ,  Still ,  authentic tone setting is not easy for CEOs and executive leadership teams 


-  Most CEOs have to learn to appreciate the power and value of artful brokering among their leadership teams 


-  Our silo-focused entrepreneurs began to recognize the need to collaborate across boundaries to deliver what our customers wanted 


-  Thats when we realized we needed to start developing an enterprise mindset ,  he said 


-  William Fung agreed: We needed to learn how to broker capabilities across the businesses in our network 


-  ,  The enterprise leaders we spoke with demonstrated  comprehensive understanding of the business and how the various pieces of their companies fit together 


-  Their understanding was informed by  variety of postings spanning boundaries of place ,  unit ,  and function 


-  ,  As Gabriels experience indicates ,  the value in crossing boundaries is not just the acquisition of experience in different units ,  functions ,  or countries but also the chance to learn how to balance competing goals and see how different units ,  cultures ,  and ways of thinking fit together and into the wider corporate whole 


-  In Gladstones view ,  this has led to more of an enterprise mindset ,  less focused on exclusively building her business and more attentive to the workings of the enterprise 


- 16 As Polman explained ,  We broker talent around the world ,  and  believe there is no better way to develop an enterprise mindset than to see  variety of pieces of the enterprise from  practical perspective 


-  ,  Leaders frequently draw on their sense of context when they ask their staffs to roll up their sleeves and make sacrifices 


-  Liz Barrett ,  then president of the companys innovative pharma division for Europe ,  shifted it to the established products unit ahead of schedule to give them extra time to develop and execute  marketing plan 


-  ,  Although  heightened sense of place and  broader sense of context are important ,  outstanding enterprise leaders also have  sharpened sense of perspective 


-  As Yaw Nsarkoh ,  managing director of Unilever Nigeria ,  explained ,  they see the overall picture but they also appreciate the pixels that make up the picture 


-  Nsarkoh told us that he takes every opportunity to learn from bosses ,  peers ,  subordinates ,  and particularly consumers  which helps him appreciate different management styles instead of forcing his own 


-  If  talented employee leaves the company to join  competitor serving the same community ,  for example ,  hell feel the loss ,  but he also knows that his former teammate will still be helping Africa 


- 17 But experience goes only so far in developing an enterprise leaders mindset 


-  We dont just throw our high-potential enterprise leaders into  job and hope that good things will happen ,  said Jonathan Donner ,  Unilevers vice president for global learning and capability development 


-  We identify stretch assignments  then make sure budding leaders are coached and mentored ,  and networked with other enterprise leaders 


-  But we need to begin rewarding them for demonstrating enterprise perspective as well 


-  Inevitably that means rethinking many time-honored review and reward systems 


-  Among them ,  Clemons says ,  is understanding the nuances of dealing with the media ,  with Congress ,  with analysts ,  and with community leaders 


-  Constructive and timely feedback can have  powerful effect on aspiring leaders and can motivate them to be similarly positive with their own people 


- 18 At Frye ,  Raffin credits feedback from  former boss with helping him sharpen his enterprise perspective ,  which he in turn attempts to pass on to others: I used to be  command and control manager  [and]  used to hoard knowledge 


-  We have created  culture and  mindset where knowledge is brokered for positive action 


-   have learned from listening to people  in trying to understand what causes their behavior  then trying my best to help them do their best 


-  ,  We know from our prior research on high-potential talent that people are drawn to peer networks that challenge and support them 


- 20 Even though leaders we spoke to indicated that they spend  great deal of time cultivating their personal and professional networks ,  we also found examples of company-designed initiatives that helped senior executives build  powerful sense of community and distributed leadership 


-  For example ,  working with  nongovernmental organization ,   recent group studied health care needs in emerging markets 


-  Thats partly due to the personal fulfillment these people found in their work but even more the result of their reflection ,  introspection ,  and willingness to change as leaders 


-  In the face of conflicts ,  employees are expected to elevate decisions to an organizational level where managers have the authority to consider the trade-offs of adhering to Unilevers purpose while remaining fiscally responsible 


-  People want to work for  company with  sense of purpose ,  Polman told us 


-  ,  At Li  Fung ,  the founders sense of purpose serves to inspire employees in their work 


-  Rather than influencing employees through individual speeches or stories ,  the everyday connections between the CEOs sense of purpose and the corporate vision form indelible impressions about whats important 


-  We need to create an organization that is fit for the future ,  and to do that we need leaders who are fit for the future ,  Unilevers Polman noted 


-  We cant build  next-generation company with  last-generation leadership mindset 


-  What  missed was how much trust our senior leaders place in people to do the right thing for our consumers ,  Kleitman explained 


-  ,  What were describing is distinct from the call for greater organizational agility ,  so often heard as an answer to increased competitive complexity 


-  Agility is critical ,  to be sure ,  but it is an organizational capability 


-  ,  How do Kleitman and other effective enterprise leaders we studied manage to see the importance of the micro and the macro simultaneously? By relying on the mindset and the senses we have discussed 


- 24 Their exposure to  variety of cultures and different business conditions helps them to abandon one-size-fits-all thinking
