-  Facebook ,  Google ,  Amazon ,  and Apple  many of todays most successful technology businesses have at their core  platform-based business model 


-  Platforms are multisided networks that bring together two or more distinct types of users and facilitate transactions among them 


-  eBay ,  for instance ,  links buyers and sellers; Playstation links game developers with gamers; Apples App Store transfers applications from software developers to iPhone and iPad users 


-  Increasingly ,  entrepreneurial startups are embracing  platform approach; look no further than fast-growing young companies such as Uber and Airbnb 


-  ,  Today ,  many entrepreneurs and established businesses are trying to copy the success of existing platform businesses 


-  Executives often assume that the key is to grow the sheer number of users and developers as quickly as possible ,  believing that get big fast is the most reliable way to win  competitive advantage 


-  ,  The reality is more complex 


-  The profit potential of  platform that dominates  market is enormous ,  but  lot can go wrong along the way  as examples from  number of industries illustrate 


-   large supply of increasingly varied content increases the value of the platform to consumers and encourages more users to join it 


-  The aim is to create  virtuous circle: The more the audience grows ,  the greater developers incentive to contribute to the platform ,  and the greater its attraction to consumers 


-  Another strategy is to offer limited but exceptional content and entice customers with killer apps that are only available on the platform 


-  ,  Sometimes ,  however ,  companies try to combine these approaches: Offer  lot of content ,  but make sure some of it is exceptional and exclusive to the platform 


-  This third way sounds good in theory ,  but our research shows that combining these strategies usually creates problems 


-  )  The case of Groupon Inc 


-  ,  the online coupon company ,  exemplifies the risks of pursuing unfocused growth 


-  ,  Between 2008 and 2012 ,  Groupons management followed an aggressive growth strategy on all fronts 


-  Of the five explicit objectives detailed in Groupons strategy in its 2012 10-K filing ,  four related directly to growth:  (  )  grow the number of merchants;  (  )  grow the customer base;  (  )  globalize the platform; and  (  )  expand through acquisitions and business development partnerships 


-  The fifth objective was to position the company to benefit from and drive technological changes affecting consumer behavior 


-  Although in theory this fifth objective was not necessarily related to growth ,  in practice it meant working to expand Groupons presence in smartphones and tablets 


-  ,  Groupons decision to enroll as many merchants as possible on its platform in effect set local businesses against each other in  discounting war  the last situation most businesses want 


-  Moreover ,  Groupon had sought exclusivity clauses that limited merchants ability to offer other online promotions near the time of their Groupon deal 


-  ,  While focusing on getting big fast ,  Groupon struggled to differentiate itself from competitors 


-  Between the companys initial public offering in November 2011 and the end of 2012 ,  Groupons stock price dropped more than 75% ,  and in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 ,  the companys combined net losses attributable to common stockholders totaled about $440 million 


-  Now the company is working to correct its past mistakes ,  but its success is not assured 


-  ,  The failure to make clear strategic choices can hurt players in  number of ways 


-  It also makes it easy to alienate potential partners 


-  Securing exclusive content can entail sweetheart deals that trade exclusivity for lower royalties ,  joint marketing and promotion expenses ,  or technical support 


-  For example ,  both Nintendo and Sega had  reputation in the 1990s for giving better tools to their internal game developers than to outsiders 


-  This alienated developers of nonexclusive products ,  as they perceived that the structure put them at either  cost or technical disadvantage 


-  This is what happened in the video game industry to the video game platforms Saturn ,  Dreamcast ,  Jaguar ,  and 3DO: They failed to take  clear strategic position between  strategic focus on variety and one on exclusivity  and as  result got stuck in the middle ,  to use Harvard Business School professor Michael  


-  ,   second ,  somewhat similar trap is to hedge the platforms bets by trying to win the mass market and  niche at the same time 


-  Our research suggests that platforms that try to capture both at once tend to have  hard time winning either customer base 


- s repositioning strategy with the PlayBook and BlackBerry Z10 offers  case in point 


-  Once  leader in the smartphone market among corporate users because it offered dedicated services such as superior emailing ,  messaging ,  and contacts managing ,  BlackBerry lost out to other devices powered by consumer-oriented rival platforms such as Googles Android and Apples iOS 


-  Instead of trying to focus on preserving its niche ,  RIM ,  which has since changed its name to BlackBerry Ltd 


-  This smorgasbord approach left the company caught in the middle ,  selling products that satisfied neither consumers nor corporate users 


-  Consumers saw no compelling reason to switch from Apple or Android ,  which already offered numerous apps 


-  Nor did corporate customers want entertainment applications cluttering the phones they bought for employees 


-  ,  Making  choice about who your customer should be can be particularly helpful to new platforms in their early days 


-  The social network MySpace ,  for example ,  tried to cater to  wide spectrum of users ,  ranging from teenagers who used it as  virtual hangout to professional musicians who used the platform to engage their fans and promote their songs 


-  This inevitably led to differences in target users demographics and content services between the two competing social networks ,  and gave Facebook  unique identity in the market relative to MySpace 


-  ,  Nintendo Wii is another product that was launched with  deliberate choice about which customers to target 


-  While Sonys Playstation III and Microsofts Xbox 360 geared more of their games toward hard-core gamers ,  the Wii devoted only  quarter of its titles to these popular genres and instead targeted more occasional gamers 


-  This distinctive positioning ,  among other things ,  allowed Nintendo to sell about 10 million units in less than two years following its introduction  nearly three times the number it had sold on its prior ,  less distinct platform 


-  ,  The importance of providing an attractive playing field for high-quality content providers is illustrated by the example of the digital book industry 


-  Amazon had  staggering success with the initial launch of the Kindle in late 2007 ,  and even in early 2010 ,  retained  90% market share in the e-book market 


-  However ,  the companys ability to lure readers to the Kindle platform was hindered by publishers reluctance to publish their newest bestsellers in an e-book format ,  because Amazon insisted on low pricing for e-books 


-  ,  Amazons thinking was that  low price would encourage consumers to accelerate their adoption of Kindle 


-  Publishers ,  however ,  saw  threat to their business model 


-  However ,  publisher obstruction of e-book titles was not  problem when Apple introduced iPads iBook service 


-  Instead of taking Amazons approach ,  Apple designed an ecosystem that allowed publishers to set their own prices ,  giving book publishers an alternative to the Kindle 


-  Nintendo in the 1990s ,  for instance ,  carefully curbed the number of competing video game titles released in its ecosystem and forbade game developers to launch more than five titles 


-  This strategy encouraged game developers to invest in high-quality titles and proved to be highly successful 


-  ,  But in other cases ,  platforms do win by leveraging competition among content developers 


-  Our research suggests that the critical difference is whether one platform dominates the market or if it is competing for  share 


-  Nintendo faced very little competition in the early 1990s ,  being de facto the dominant platform in the video game market at the time 


-  If  platform with strong market power encourages competition ,  developers are left with very little incentive to invest in developing high-quality content  since they are in  market with  platform that has  near-monopoly 


-  By contrast ,  when competing plaftorms represent viable options for content developers ,  such as in the case of Sonys PlayStation and Microsofts Xbox ,  or Apples App Store and Googles Play ,  the platform provider can allow for greater levels of competition among content developers before content developers lose their incentive to develop high-quality content 


-  ,  In general ,  growing the number of users and content suppliers is important in most platform strategies 


-  However ,  our research suggests that platform strategists are sometimes mistaken when they confuse size with the strength of the platforms underlying value proposition  particularly when what looks like  winning proposition for  customer is not always  winning proposition from the content providers point of view 


-  In the end ,  success in  platform business is not  matter simply of collecting apps and eyeballs 


-  Its about creating  proposition that produces value for the suppliers ,  for the customers ,  and for the platform
