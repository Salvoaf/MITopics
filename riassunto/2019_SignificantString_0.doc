-  ,  Now ,  with hindsight ,  we can interpret his spoof not just as  joke but as  desperate bid to raise  taboo subject: The companys device didnt work and the leadership team was hiding that fact 


-  We have observed this dynamic in  wide variety of settings and have drawn on this experience to propose  framework ,   set of diagnostic questions ,  and some targeted solutions to help teams address their own undiscussables 


-  ,  At Theranos ,  CEO Elizabeth Holmes and her top team were unwilling even to acknowledge concerns that were obvious to many of their engineers 


-  ,  The Theranos case illustrates what can happen when questioning voices are silenced and topics placed off-limits 


-  And its getting worse as increasingly virtual and globally distributed teams find it harder to pick up signals of discomfort and anticipate misunderstandings 


-  ,  When the leadership teams we work with struggle with undiscussables ,  the symptoms they present to us range from unresolved conflicts among team members and uneven participation in meetings to destructive groupthink and employee disengagement 


-  This leads to bad decisions that are made worse ,  because without open ,  honest discussion ,   team cannot learn from its mistakes or correct course 


-  The thinking-saying gap  ( Theranos engineers knew their device didnt work but couldnt say so )  is just one category 


-  There is also the saying-meaning gap ,  the feeling-naming gap ,  and the doing-knowing gap 


-  Some are known to everyone on the team ,  while others are sensed only by  few or are utterly unknown ,  existing outside the teams collective consciousness 


-  Different types of undiscussables need to be surfaced in different ways 


-  Some can be drawn out through direct questions; others must be inferred from patterns of behavior and then validated with the team 


-  ( See Diagnosing the Problem:  Checklist for questions leaders can ask to identify their teams undiscussables 


-  Undiscussables are most commonly associated with risky questions ,  suggestions ,  and criticisms that are self-censored 


-  They were unaccustomed to speaking their minds 


-  Coming in with  tough change mandate ,  the CEO needed her teams honest input and wholehearted buy-in 


-  That makes team members feel unsafe 


-  Power and status differences tend to discourage team members from bringing up issues or concerns they think the leader may view as disruptive or even none of their business 


-  ,  Beginning the fix: How can leaders minimize those power differences and make it safe to speak up? By explicitly acknowledging they may unwittingly have created  climate of fear or uncertainty ,  inviting discussion about sensitive issues ,  drawing out concerns ,  promising immunity to those who share dissenting views ,  and lightening the weight of their authority in the room 


-  To model her commitment to openness and reduce mistrust ,  she asked the team to submit anonymous questions in writing about her style and her intentions 


-  She then asked the HR head to run an honest dialogue session with the team  ( while she was absent )  to encourage productive disagreement 


-  ,  In subsequent meetings ,  with the CEO present ,  whenever the team seemed reluctant to push back on  proposal ,  she would say ,  I feel there might be something else 


-  And when  come back ,   want you as  team to share your concerns 


-  Eventually ,  as the team realized the CEO really did want constructive pushback ,  leaving the room became unnecessary 


-  They should avoid stating their preferences or opinions at the beginning of team discussions and refrain from immediately judging the contributions of others 


-  They also can show that they are part of the group by sharing their mistakes and engaging in maintenance behaviors ,  including saying we rather than I ,  encouraging team members to voice their concerns ,  and acknowledging their contributions 


-  ,  Teams often proclaim but fail to follow certain values ,  objectives ,  or practices that are supposed to guide and inspire them and create  sense of togetherness 


-  ,  The chief concern in such teams is protecting the group ,  as opposed to protecting the individual in the think-but-dare-not-say category of undiscussables 


-  Silence is not based on fear as much as on an unquestioned and distorted sense of loyalty to the team ,  its leader ,  or the organization 


-  Drawing attention to the disconnect between intentions and actions would feel like letting down colleagues and killing team spirit 


-  This false positivity ,  which people express by simply mouthing accepted values ,  practices ,  and objectives  the espoused theory  hides any concerns that the team might be incapable of making the necessary changes to the organization and that people might lose their jobs as  result 


-  This protective impulse may appear innocent ,  but in the long run ,  it undermines learning and leads to disillusionment as people stop trusting the value of one anothers words and commitments 


-  ,  Beginning the fix: Team leaders must first expose the hypocrisy of saying but not meaning and acknowledge their part in the charade ,  collecting anonymous examples of empty proclamations and challenging the overprotective mindset that inhibits the airing of criticism 


-  They can initiate the process by asking the team to complete this sentence: We say we want to ,  but in fact ,  we 


-  How the government doesnt understand us 


-   ,  The CEO acknowledged that the team was not ,  in fact ,  doing what it said it was doing nor what the company needed: reinventing its business model and processes 


-  In this way ,  he demonstrated the level of candor and self-criticism needed to break the team out of its slump ,  closing the gap between meaning and saying 


-  I think we have  very open dialogue now 


-  We dont argue anymore about Is the world changing or not? Its already changed 


-  Now ,  its all about ,  Can we get ahead of the curve? Can we change the world for the better?  ,  Team leaders play  key role in initiating the soul-searching ,  ensuring that the organizations stated goal is the real goal ,  stressing  collective responsibility to keep one another honest ,  listening to alternative viewpoints ,  and breaking down the unproductive and misconceived connection between criticism and disloyalty 


-  Some undiscussables are rooted in negative feelings  such as annoyance ,  mistrust ,  and frustration  that are difficult for team members to label or express constructively 


-  Each felt the other was behaving unreasonably 


-  ,  The behavior or comments of colleagues with divergent perspectives can trigger allergic reactions ,  often based on misunderstandings 


-  Too easily blamed on  vague lack of chemistry ,  these feelings can infect the whole team ,  especially when the pressure is on 


-  Based on their own worldviews and self-protective instincts ,  they presume they know why the other party is acting in  particular way and let that drive their behavior 


-  ,  Beginning the fix: The feuding parties need help to investigate the differences  in personality ,  experience ,  and identity  that sustain and fuel their apparent incompatibilities ,  their so-called lack of chemistry 


-  The team leaders role is to ensure that individuals feel equally welcome and accepted within the team and promote diversity as  source of insight ,  not friction 


-  One strategy is to ask team members to complete the sentence I feel  to literally put  name to the feeling to surface whatever is bothering them 


-  ,   neutral coach can help team members open up by asking essential follow-on questions and probing for clarification when needed 


-  This process can be augmented with  formal assessment tool that captures individual team members personality profiles and  common framework that helps people understand the roots of their colleagues behaviors 


-  On one dimension of the personality assessment ,  the COO favored big picture thinking and gravitated toward new ideas ,  while the CTO was extremely detail-oriented and practical ,  leaning toward the tried-and-true 


-  This insight helped explain why the CTO constantly raised objections to the COOs sweeping solutions to problems 


-  ,  In the process of discussing how their personality scores tallied with their self-images ,  another factor emerged: The COO saw himself as  problem solver ,  while the CTO defined himself as  self-starter ,  relying on his own independent judgment 


-  ,  These differences in self-image helped explain why the valuable experience of the COO was resisted by the CTO ,  who resented interference and dreaded becoming dependent 


-  The CTO appeared to the COO as  know-it-all; the COO saw the CTO as someone who could not and would not take advice 


-  Even if feedback and advice are well intentioned ,  they may challenge another persons self-image as competent ,  honest ,  or likable ,  triggering  strong ,  negative emotional response 


-  ,  Once you understand where colleagues are coming from ,  it becomes easier to value and leverage their input without taking their comments or behavioral quirks as attempts to show off ,  frustrate ,  or take advantage 


-  But self-knowledge is equally valuable: When you can see and describe your own tendencies accurately ,  your colleagues are less likely to take your quirks personally 


-  You DO but dont realize 


-  ,  This is what psychologists call projection ,  wherein we ascribe our own thoughts and feelings to someone else 


-  ,  Teams instinctively develop defensive routines to cope with anxiety ,  such as that generated by feeling ignored or undervalued 


-  This allows them to avoid thinking about or even naming the underlying issues 


-  If they were checked out ,  they wouldnt be bothered by the fact that he was 


-  ,  As described by British psychotherapist Wilfred Bion ,  unconscious and unacknowledged undiscussables manifest in seemingly unrelated team dynamics  hence the difficulty connecting the dots 


-  All these interactions impeded critical self-review 


-  Team members fall into rigid roles ,  sit in the same chairs ,  and follow rituals that impair their ability to question assumptions and get their jobs done 


-  The team leader can invite  trusted adviser from another part of the organization or an external facilitator to observe the team and give feedback on communication habits ,  including body language ,  who talks and how often ,  whom people look at when they talk ,  who interrupts whom ,  who or what is blamed when things go wrong ,  what is not spoken about ,  who stays silent ,  and whose comments are ignored 


-  ,   trained observer can then engage in what MIT Sloan School of Managements pioneering organizational psychologist Edgar Schein calls humble inquiry ,  in which the aim is to elicit information and feelings important to the teams mission 


-  The questioners outsider status allows for naive ,  unthreatening questioning of the unconscious processes at play 


-  But ,  to help reset their behavior in meetings and inculcate new habits ,  the team members also took two concrete measures: They agreed to  one-month ban on devices in their meetings  ( with fines donated to charity for violations )  ,  and they drew up  team charter clarifying new behavioral expectations that included listening to each other ,  asking more questions ,  delaying assumptions ,  and summarizing conclusions and follow-up actions 


-  But instead of trying to fix all of them at once ,  we advise team leaders to take  sequential approach ,  starting with the two more conscious categories they can have an immediate impact on: knowing but not daring to say and saying but not meaning it 


-  The best point of entry is making sure we do what we say 


-  You can engage in some preparatory reflection by asking yourself ,  Is this  problem  have helped create? Acknowledging your own responsibility is  powerful way of unblocking the discussion and setting an expectation of candor 


-  ,  Easy wins can help team members realize that what they gain will outweigh the pain  generating momentum to move from above-the-surface undiscussables to deeper undiscussables that usually require facilitation or external intervention 


-  The team was outstanding at monitoring its dynamics in real time  ( with the assistance of  designated observer )  ,  as well as reviewing what happened ,  taking account of feelings as well as facts 


-  While the pressure to avoid tough issues never lets up ,  surfacing undiscussables almost always pays off  provided it is done in  constructive manner 


-  ,  There is just one situation where we would not recommend it: If youve inherited  dysfunctional team and have to achieve something fast ,  spending time diagnosing and unearthing undiscussables may not be an optimal approach 


-  ,  However ,  the takeaway remains the same: In an increasingly fast-paced world ,  teams desperately need  space to talk about the way they go about their business
