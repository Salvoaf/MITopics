- No question ,  in  competitive global landscape ,  collaboration allows companies to serve exacting clients more seamlessly ,  respond more quickly to changing environments ,  and innovate more rapidly 


-  But when an organization tries to boost collaboration by adopting  new formal structure ,  technology ,  or way of working ,  it often adds  steady stream of time- and energy-consuming interactions to an already relentless workload ,  diminishing instead of improving performance 


-  ,  Think about the consequences at an individual level: Its not unusual to feel as if we are just starting our work at   


-  Thanks to the plethora of technologies that keep us connected ,  increasingly integrated global operations ,  and the need for  multidisciplinary approach to deploying complex products and services ,  the problem has snowballed over the past decade ,  with collaborative time demands rising more than 50% 


-  Most knowledge workers and leaders spend 85% or more of their time on email ,  in meetings ,  and on the phone 


-  Employees struggle with increases in email volume ,  the proliferation of new collaborative tools ,  and expectations of fast replies to messages  with deleterious effects on their quality of work and efficiency 


-  Research tells us that simple distractions like checking  text message fragment our attention more than we realize ,  and more consuming distractions  such as answering an email  can cost us more than 20 minutes to fully regain our focus 


-  ,  Even though employees are acutely aware that theyre suffering ,  most organizations dont recognize whats happening in the aggregate 


-  We can track an airline receipt down to two decimal places and create  whole infrastructure around compliance ,  but we have no idea how effective networks are or where collaborative time is being spent ,  lamented the CIO of one company we studied 


-  With increasing pressure on organizations to become more agile ,  there is also  greater tendency to swamp employees with collaboration demands in pursuit of  networked organization 


-  We have found that people have ,  on average ,  at least nine different technologies to manage their interactions with work groups 


-  The result can be overwhelmed and unproductive employees ,  sapped creativity ,  and employee attrition 


-  ,  Fortunately ,  it is possible to improve collaboration efforts with the help of analytics 


-  Perhaps the first industry to do so was professional basketball ,  where quantitative analysts realized that some players scored relatively little but somehow made their teammates more successful 


-  Similar analysis has been deployed by professional soccer teams to identify what patterns of passing were most effective for scoring goals under particular circumstances 


-  But the benefits of understanding patterns of collaboration can be reaped in all kinds of organizations 


-  Using analytics to make collaborative activities more transparent helps companies identify and exploit previously invisible drivers of revenue production ,  innovation ,  and employee effectiveness 


-  Analytics enables better management of what has become an enormous yet hidden cost for organizations ,  one that employees arent equipped to manage on their own 


-  ,  In our research on collaboration over the past decade ,  we have seen some effective uses of analytics emerge in two industry consortia ,  where weve identified whether collaborations are driving value or unintentionally consuming resources 


-  These organizations have gone beyond documenting simple collaborative activities  who talks to whom at what frequency  to systematically relating collaborative activities to key outcomes 


-  ,  In particular ,  we found five main ways in which companies derive value from collaboration analytics 


-  First ,  they scale collaboration effectively by deploying targeted analytics to connect critical roles  ( for instance ,  project leads and first-line leaders )  and to link employees engaged in similar work who are distributed across functions ,  units ,  or geographies 


-  Second ,  organizations improve collaborative design and execution by understanding how networks cross hierarchies and team structures ,  and by replicating drivers of success 


-  Third ,  they use collaborative analytics to drive planned and emergent innovation through networks that cross capabilities ,  markets ,  or functions 


-  Fourth ,  the insights they glean from analytics allow them to streamline collaborative work by diagnosing and reducing collaborative overload and removing unnecessary routine decision-making interactions 


-  Fifth ,  companies engage talent by using collaboration analytics to identify social capital enablers of performance ,  engagement ,  and retention 


-  Scaling collaboration effectively 


-  Most organizations have developed deep talent in knowledge-intensive core capabilities ,  but its much less common that those individuals with expertise are systematically connected to one another 


-  They can be far-flung throughout the organization ,  often distributed across functions ,  geographies ,  and P&Ls ,  which means that no single leader or unit is responsible for deriving benefits from their collaborations 


-  As  result ,  scale benefits are often very limited 


-  ,  Collaboration analytics ,  however ,  can maximize the benefits of scale in three key areas: ,  Take ,  for example ,  General Electric ,  which has an enormous knowledge base in its more than 300 , 000 employees around the globe ,  across nine businesses 


-  Prior to 2015 ,  GEs efforts to link distributed pockets of expertise were uneven 


-  We had bright spots where cross-business expertise sharing was working ,  but we were not consistent within and across segments 


-  Leaders saw the opportunity to improve collaboration across the company through new analytics-powered expertise communities 


-  The goal was to enable expertise integration in  natural way that would require little effort from the experts involved 


-  ,  Ranta and his team first developed  quantitative model to predict whether  given community was ready to share its expertise globally ,  on the basis of data collected about successful knowledge-sharing communities elsewhere in the company 


-  They calculated scores that reflected the maturity of collaboration among community members ,  their degree of mutual commitment to success ,  the extent to which their local technological environment would support  global community ,  and the level of support for  global community within their organization 


-  When the model predicted that  community was ready ,  Rantas team included that community in  new knowledge-sharing architecture featuring discussion spaces where experts could interact globally 


-  Those that were not ready were steered instead toward smaller and more focused structures ,  such as mission-based teams 


-  ,  GE used analytics to predict which community member would have the right expertise to answer each kind of question and ,  through industrial-scale software ,  to automatically distribute questions to the appropriate community experts 


-  For community management purposes ,  GE generated real-time analytics of collaboration patterns to identify the employees who were most engaged and making  difference across locations 


-  ,  As  result of this work ,  GEs expertise is becoming easier to tap ,  wherever it resides 


-  For example ,  GEs Renewable Energy business ,  with approximately 43 , 000 employees ,  has deployed 27 communities to connect individuals across hundreds of technical discussions that span geographical and business boundaries ,  collectively producing  vast array of solutions and learnings 


-  In one year ,   , 172 internal collaborators collectively solved  total of 513 customer problems ,  resulting in more than $1 


-  million of cost avoidance in productivity 


-  Analytics powers our processes ,  minimizes the human cost of helping each other out ,  and lets us tap into the thickest vein in the gold mine of sharing ,  which is human generosity and professional pride ,  Ranta noted 


-  Improving collaborative design and execution 


-  Team-based structures are common in organizations ,  but employees assigned to too many teams end up slowing efforts and creating significant disruption if they burn out and leave 


-  Collaboration analytics can help leaders determine where team structures are most effective ,  informing in-house training and generating best practices that help replicate those networks and tune teams for agility and speed 


-  ,  Lateral collaboration is particularly challenging in investment banking firms 


-  Despite often advocating  one firm culture ,  the hierarchies that grow under  partner often lead employees to concentrate all of their efforts within their teams ,  while time constraints further limit their ability to learn about solutions available from other partner silos 


-  This can lead client-facing teams to focus on selling their own solutions rather than integrated ,  holistic solutions that command higher margins and improve client retention 


-  ,  Executives at one global investment bank realized that this partner-silo structural dilemma was preventing their firm from catching up to industry leaders 


-  Through  network analysis ,  an analytics team quantified the number of revenue-producing ties among midtier team leaders to understand where integrated offerings based on bundles of skills were  and were not  happening 


-  The team discovered an asset that had been overlooked: mid-tier employees who enabled others to cross-sell services 


-  Compared with other employees ,  these hidden integrators had three times as many ties across partner groups ,  and their connections were almost five times more likely to link poorly connected teams 


-  Financially ,  these hidden integrators accounted for more than six times the average cross-selling revenue 


-  ,  But it turned out that in spite of their tremendous value to the firm ,  these hidden integrators were actually at risk 


-  Analytics revealed that they were underappreciated: Their impact on cross-selling was largely invisible to the company and not counted toward revenue generation 


-  Leaders quickly adjusted the compensation system to acknowledge their critical contributions 


-  ,  Perhaps most important ,  analytics revealed that these valuable integrators were successful in different ways 


-  Some integrators specialized in enabling many smaller transactions ,  so the firm freed up their time for this 


-  Other integrators excelled at enabling much larger transactions  ( more than $15 million )  ,  but because these occurred much less frequently ,  these employees had to be managed and rewarded differently for their longer-term efforts 


-  Driving planned and emergent innovation 


-  Innovation is inherently  social process ,  grounded in the creative friction that comes when people with different types of expertise and experiences pull one another in unexpected directions and arrive at something entirely new 


-  Understanding where an organization should stimulate innovation by building networks that bring together people with different kinds of expertise is not something best left to chance 


-  Collaboration analytics can uncover silos across capabilities that  if better integrated  could spur innovation and translate creative ideas into production-ready offerings 


-  ,  General Motors used collaboration analytics to do just that 


-  Radically new business models are emerging in the automobile industry for shared mobility ,  autonomous driving ,  electrification ,  and connectivity 


-  But despite these investments in GMs human capital ,  executives also recognized the importance of social capital ,  or the networks of ties that connect employees and amplify their individual capabilities 


-  To produce  dramatic increase in the companys agility and innovativeness ,  GM focused on creating what then-chief talent officer Michael Arena termed adaptive space   network of connections that link the entrepreneurial pockets of innovation within the company to its traditional execution-focused operational elements 


-  This began to chip away at historic silos 


-  Creating adaptive space required interventions around four different kinds of networks: idea discovery ,  concept development ,  innovation diffusion ,  and organizational disruption 


-  Although all were important ,  lets focus on the second stage  concept development  in which promising ideas were rapidly developed into emergent innovations 


-  ,  Arena asked the internal analytics team to study the networks of two development groups that transformed ideas into novel prototypes 


-  Collaboration analytics derived from network data revealed that the more successful group had  clustering coefficient  ( the degree to which  group consists of small ,  tightly knit subgroups )  that was more than two times higher than that of its less successful counterpart 


-  That way ,  they were able to concentrate on perfecting one thing at  time and make rapid ,  focused progress 


-  Through these ties ,  team members tasked with one aspect of development shared their advancements with members from other clusters in ways that helped combine local innovations into  functioning ,  broader automotive concept 


-  Interestingly ,  while the successful network had more internal ties ,  its members had fewer external ties to potential idea sources in industry or academia ,  so they were free from outside distractions that could hinder their focus on the task at hand throughout development 


-  The less successful development group had more external connections ,  which were valuable in enabling discovery of new insights but often led the team to hedge their development bets by simultaneously pursuing multiple different possibilities 


-  ,  The combination of acquiring skilled employees and ensuring that these individuals are properly positioned in the network has enabled GM to adapt faster to the disruptive forces that surround it 


-  Streamlining collaborative work 


-  As employees spend more of their time in meetings ,  on phone calls ,  and on email ,  collaboration analytics can play  powerful role in identifying where excessive connectivity is draining time ,  slowing speed to market ,  or hurting employee morale 


-  Collaboration overload can beset specific individuals or roles ,  and collaboration analytics can identify the situations where some people are collaboratively far less efficient than others in the organization 


-  Sometimes overload is created through excessively inclusive decision processes 


-  In general ,  overload occurs when more than  quarter of the people who interact with any individual employee report  ( through an internal survey )  that they cannot improve their own performance without more access to that individual 


-  ,  Perhaps nowhere is streamlining collaborative work more important than in the commercialization of new pharmaceuticals 


-  Commercialization occurs after most of the enormous investments required to develop  new drug have been made but before the product hits the shelves 


-  It is extraordinarily time-sensitive ,  with  single days delay costing the company millions in lost profits 


-  But drug commercialization is also incredibly collaboration-intensive ,  requiring orchestration among regulatory affairs ,  medical affairs ,  R&D ,  sales ,  marketing ,  legal ,  advocacy ,  manufacturing ,  and many other functions 


-  ,  Streamlining collaboration can have  direct and immediate effect on the bottom line 


-  The leader of  drug commercialization unit in one pharmaceutical company we studied discovered that truth after using collaboration analytics to identify opportunities to increase efficiency of routine decision-making ,  which often seemed to be taking too long 


-  The analytics team asked each member of the commercialization group to answer  series of questions about his or her network of collaborators ,  including how much time each spent in routine versus nonroutine decisions 


-  Armed with data about the estimated delay these types of decisions caused ,  the team used text analytics to calculate which categories of decisions delayed the process the longest 


-  ,  Focusing on each area of opportunity for improvement ,  leaders and their staffs drafted guidelines for optimal decision-making ,  in some cases developing decision-flow schematics to ensure that all parties involved knew the best sequence and timelines 


-  They revised governance principles and trained employees to push responsibility and accountability down in the organization 


-  ,  The analytics team also discovered significant variation in how much time individuals spent collaborating with certain roles within the unit and preparing for those interactions  ( what we term collaborative efficiency )  


-  Statistical analyses identified four specific roles in which individuals were acting in ways that they may have believed to be efficient but that did not adhere to any standardized best practice 


-  Those who were most efficient in those roles consumed only  small amount of time from each person in his or her network ,  while those who were least efficient consumed many times as much 


-  Subsequent calculations revealed that improving the latter groups efficiency could have  catalytic effect on the entire organization 


-  Simply bringing it up to average could free up more than 17 , 000 hours of collaboration time annually in the rest of the organization  the equivalent of almost nine full-time employees 


-  ,  With these insights ,  the unit was able to recoup thousands of hours and shave time off the overall commercialization process 


-  Analyzing collaboration in this way showed that changes were possible and desirable ,  and provided the diagnostic insights to help other groups in the company discover new and better ways of doing their jobs 


-  ,  Using survey-based data about collaboration is not the only way to glean useful insights about  companys collaboration inefficiencies 


-  Its also possible to extract collaboration data from existing digital sources ,  such as meeting and email data ,  as  by-product of other behaviors 


-   leader in the secondary mortgage market ,  employed  passive data collaboration analytics engine that enabled its analytics team to easily identify opportunities for streamlining 


-  One unit seemed particularly effective ,  and analysis of passive collaboration data revealed how those employees behaviors were different from others in the company 


-  This group had created  culture of empowerment and strong working relationships among employees 


-  For instance ,  they spent 56% less time in approval-related meetings and 29% more time on approval-related emails 


-  They also worked with greater autonomy ,  spending 20% less time in meetings where their supervisor was present 


-  And they were more focused when in face-to-face collaborations ,  having 40% fewer meeting conflicts and sending 18% fewer emails while in meetings 


-   rapidly developing set of collaboration analytics applications has emerged as  natural extension of the people analytics functions in organizations 


-  For instance ,  companies are doing the following: ,  Booz Allen Hamilton provides  rare example of the use of predictive collaboration analytics to not just anticipate but also improve employee retention 


-  The company had already developed  predictive attrition model based on data such as demographic attributes ,  work characteristics ,  level in the organization ,  length of service ,  and compensation and benefits 


-  The model pinpointed key attrition drivers and identified employees at greatest risk of leaving the company who might benefit from targeted interventions 


-  ,  Data suggested that the risk for turnover was highest following an employees transition to  new role 


-  Further analysis revealed that how an employee managed networks shaped the odds of leaving after  transition 


-  Mapping data about the size ,  reach ,  and quality of each employees collaboration network against attrition data uncovered different insights at specific tenure bands 


-  The analysis contradicted much of the traditional advice about networks  ( for instance ,  that  big network is always  good network )  


-  ,  Five categories of network-based factors distinguished employees who departed within two years of joining the company from those who stayed 


-  ( See Network Drivers of Retention at Booz Allen Hamilton 


-  )  The people who stayed were those who created more energy in their interactions with others ,  helped others find  sense that their work had purpose and mattered ,  generated pull  ( or demand )  for their talents ,  created diversity of thought through broader networks ,  and connected with  strong peer cohort 


-  On the basis of these findings ,  Booz Allen implemented  new onboarding program that focused on the specific network dimensions that were most likely to increase retention 


-  Follow-up analyses confirmed  significant improvement in retention as  result of the new collaboration training 


-  ,   second example involves using collaboration analytics to more efficiently and effectively assess performance management   key driver of employee engagement12  at  


-  Gore  Associates ,  an R&D-based product development company 


-  The companys flat ,  latticelike organizational structure empowers associates to decide which leaders to follow and also makes them directly accountable to members of their teams 


-  Without traditional bosses to evaluate performance ,  team members rate one another on their contributions  ( impact and effectiveness )  ,  which is combined into  ranking of all associates within their areas across the company 


-  The ranking system is then used to determine associates compensation 


-  The companys global growth meant that many associates were working on multiple colocated and virtual teams ,  with any single team aware of only  small slice of an associates performance 


-  As  result ,  evaluating contributions could take many days to complete for  single associate ,  particularly for those individuals who were central to the networks of performance in the company 


-  ,  Gore began to explore  more streamlined ,  two-pronged approach ,  using collaboration analytics 


-  First ,  automated surveys empowered individual associates to nominate network contacts who knew their contributions best 


-  An algorithm ingested all this collaboration data and revealed which associates were in  position to compare pairs of other associates 


-  All this typically took each associate 15 to 20 minutes to complete rather than hours or days 


-  Analytics run on the aggregated data set then produced rankings for all associates in the company 


-  Conservatively ,  we estimated 10 , 000 hours  year that our approach saved ,  but in reality ,  it was probably several multiples of that ,  noted team member Willis Jensen 


-  Equally important ,  the new process was still well aligned with the companys empowerment culture 


-  ,  Despite widespread agreement that collaboration is critical to achieving desired business outcomes ,  organizations have been flying blind on how to maximize that value under specific circumstances 


-  Too often ,  well-intended collaboration initiatives have actually been counterproductive ,  sliding into overload for key employees 


-  With collaboration analytics ,  we can begin to shed light on who needs to collaborate with whom about what ,  what types of collaboration yield particular results ,  and how collaboration affects employee satisfaction ,  performance ,  and attrition 


-  ,  Far beyond traditional analytics that simply provide descriptive ,  visual models of who talks to whom ,   new generation of collaboration analytics is emerging ,  with more predictive and prescriptive capabilities 


-  These analytics use advanced methods ,  including machine learning ,  to identify key data without requiring extra effort from employees and to relate collaboration metrics to  variety of business performance measures 


-  They have the potential to ensure that initiatives designed to help make your team more productive dont backfire spectacularly 


-  ,  These new approaches are putting collaboration analytics on an even plane with other important analytical tools in organizations 


-  They are bringing the decision-making power of data and analytics to human cooperation at work
