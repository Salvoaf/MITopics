- Chase Rief runs  small media company in Newport Beach ,  California  or ,  rather ,  from Newport Beach: Rief Medias 14-person workforce is scattered around the world ,  all independent contractors he hired through an online service called oDesk 


-  At the other end of the size spectrum ,  life insurance giant Aegon has an on-demand workforce of 300 licensed virtual agents managed through another online intermediary ,  LiveOps 


-  ,  First came outsourcing of IT and business processes 


-   third-generation sourcing ecosystem already being used by companies as diverse as Rief Media and Aegon ,  the human cloud is centered on an online middleman that engages  pool of virtual workers that can be tapped on demand to provide  wide range of services to any interested buyer 


-  Although jobs involving content generation ,  sales and marketing ,  and design and optimization currently top the list of tasks that can be performed by cloud workers ,   recent industry report identifies at least 15 major labor categories that could be sent to the human cloud 


-  The number of platforms and middlemen has also skyrocketed 


-  ,  Some analysts see the human cloud as potentially more disruptive than the previous two sourcing waves 


-  They believe it will reshape established business processes ,  redraw organizational boundaries and  most importantly  profoundly change global labor markets 


-  After studying the evolution of human cloud platforms over the last few years ,  we share these analysts excitement but also think that the road ahead will be bumpier than some advocates would have us believe 


-  )  As with the past waves of outsourcing ,  harnessing the power of the human cloud will require the evolution and adoption of  new set of best practices and structures by the key sourcing stakeholders  the buyers and the suppliers 


-  ,  The human cloud is not  new idea 


-  ,  Crowdsourcing allows organizations to transfer  task previously performed in-house to  large ,  usually undefined ,  group of people 


-  Wikipedia ,  iStockphoto and other high-profile examples demonstrated the power of crowdsourcing in enabling new business models 


-  space agency NASA ,  for example ,  developed  successful initiative  NASA Clickworkers  that enlisted volunteers from all over the world to help identify and label landforms on Mars 


-  In general ,  crowdsourcing involves large-scale projects completed by  collective of people with no direct or guaranteed monetary incentive to participate 


-  ,  Microsourcing allows buyers to source paid projects ,  or fractional tasks ,  over the Internet from individuals or small providers 


-  The initial idea centered on an online marketplace for freelancers ,  similar to eBay ,  but in which buyers and suppliers exchange services instead of goods 


-  Yet microsourcing is similar to crowdsourcing in that the initial search for  supplier starts with an open call aimed at  large and mostly undefined collective of potential workers 


-  ,  However ,  despite enthusiasm for the concept of  virtual workforce ,  two obstacles have prevented businesses from large-scale adoption of crowdsourcing and microsourcing since their first introduction more than 12 years ago: perceived risk ,  and limited capacity to handle projects of larger scale and scope 


-  ,  Most managers feel anxious about delegating work to  supplier with whom they have had only virtual contact 


-  In her organization ,  she has had to work hard to convince colleagues to start working with suppliers they can neither shake hands with nor train 


-  ,  The more serious problem has been the limited capacity of crowdsourcing and microsourcing to handle complex and large-scale work 


-  Microsourcing platforms provide easy and efficient mechanisms to connect the two parties but offer limited support for collaboration and coordination 


-  This makes them great for facilitating limited short-term projects that can be completed by  single supplier but not for the more common need for multiple interconnected tasks that demand the coordination of multiple skill sets ,  or for engagement-based services such as support ,  help desk and infrastructure maintenance 


-  ,  To meet the needs of more potential buyers ,  the major human cloud platforms have developed four business models that show great promise in overcoming these obstacles and spurring growth 


-  Buyers may still not be able to look the supplier in the eye ,  but they do have access to  wealth of information about the candidate 


-  Facilitator platforms ,  like Elance and oDesk ,  have built frameworks for suppliers to share their professional and personal backgrounds ,  show off their portfolios and earnings history and demonstrate skills through standardized tests 


-  ,  The platforms have also made workflows more transparent to the buyer 


-  Elance ,  for example ,  offers project management tools that enable buyers to create project milestones ,  receive status reports from suppliers and link payments to milestone completion 


-  Similarly ,  oDesk has developed  sophisticated system of remote work management that monitors suppliers online work activity and tracks time spent on each task 


-  Such features give companies such as tiny Rief Media the confidence and ability to manage  virtual workforce 


-  ,  The Arbitrator Model: Supplier Redundancy Companies often have to source work that is highly unstructured and difficult to evaluate and/or that requires special expertise ,  such as design or research and development 


-  Tapping into the global talent pool and engaging multiple skilled providers to work on the same project would be highly attractive but ,  before the human cloud ,  was beyond reach of all but the largest companies 


-  ,   human cloud model we call the Arbitrator model aims to make this option more accessible 


-  Having started out with logo design ,  crowdSPRING today runs  wide range of projects ,  including copywriting and website and industrial design 


-  South Korean-based electronics giant LG Electronics ,  for example ,  turned to crowdSPRING to carry out  global online competition to design  mobile phone of the future 


-  Another example of the Arbitrator model is Massachusetts-based InnoCentive ,  which uses crowdsourcing to solve complex problems 


-  InnoCentives online community includes scientists and researchers ready to take on unsolved R&D problems for companies throughout the world 


-  ,  The Aggregator Model: Task Aggregation Some companies have work that does not require coordination among the workers who perform  very large number of simple ,  repetitive tasks ,  such as cleaning up  large customer contacts database 


-  An Aggregator provides buyers with  single interface to send work to  large number of small suppliers 


-  It provides an infrastructure to run projects similar to that of NASA Clickworkers at minimal cost and ramp-up time 


-  ,  Consider ,  for example ,  Amazon Mechanical Turk ,  or MTurk ,  which in 2011 boasted over 500 , 000 suppliers 


-  Buyers post projects consisting of  large number of simple repetitive tasks that workers are willing to perform for  few cents 


-  These tasks ,  which MTurk calls human intelligence tasks ,  do not require any special expertise or knowledge on the part of suppliers ,  but they do involve human judgment and are difficult to automate 


-  Another aggregator ,  Finland-based Microtask ,  segments projects and then breaks them down into game-like tasks that offer players or workers monetary and nonmonetary incentives for completion and quality 


-  Germany-based Clickworker ,  for instance ,  guarantees quality to the buyer by having more experienced workers review tasks completed by their less experienced counterparts 


-  Honda ,  for example ,  employed Clickworker to complete  project involving tagging objects in images of traffic situations 


-  The output was used by the automaker to develop an onboard computer functionality to help vehicles avoid road obstacles 


-  According to  2012 industry report ,  their No 


-  To tackle this ,  platforms in the Governor model employ  combination of human project managers working on-staff and  sophisticated software-enabled framework for monitoring and coordinating individual tasks 


-  Governors provide  thicker layer of project governance ,  including collecting project requirements from the client ,  breaking them up into microtasks ,  coordinating completion and sequencing of individual tasks ,  conducting supplier certification and ensuring quality of the final deliverable 


-  ,  Computer programming service company TopCoder and its community-based model of software development provide perhaps the most advanced example of  Governor platform 


-  Multiple suppliers take part in each of the competitions ,  and the winning output of each preceding round  ( as determined by more experienced members of the community )  becomes an input to the subsequent one 


-  Using this model ,  TopCoder has built and deployed enterprise-grade software for multinationals such as financial giant UBS ,  home loan company Lending Tree ,  and sports broadcaster ESPN 


-  ,  To reduce perceived risks to the buyer ,  the Aggregator and Governor models shift the focus from individual suppliers  ( the crowd )  to the platform  ( the company )  


-  This arrangement requires  much smaller leap of faith on the part of the buyer ,  since it resembles  traditional outsourcing relationship 


-  )  Because human cloud projects are really just  special flavor of outsourcing ,  buyers may find it helpful to think about launching and managing  human cloud initiative in the same way that they manage the main phases of any outsourcing engagement 


-  ,  Architectural phase Architectural design is the first phase of sourcing ,  the point at which  buyer defines its choices on key dimensions of the future engagement 


-  In the human cloud context ,  three such dimensions need to be taken into account: the number of suppliers ,  the degree of interdependence among suppliers and supplier expertise 


-  The latter is the traditional business model: one buyer ,  one supplier 


-   small business that develops its storefront website by contracting through the virtual employment agency vWorker is an example of such  scenario 


-  ,  Where the human cloud introduces real innovation is in providing multiple redundant suppliers at once ,  sometimes via  competition or contest-based mechanism 


-  For example ,  multiple InnoCentive Solvers  ( working sometimes in teams )  who take on  tricky research problem are more likely to come up with an acceptable solution than  single research team 


-  insurer ,  is  good example 


-  Because of the greater complexity and scope of the project ,  suppliers on Governor platforms also tend to have  higher level of expertise and possess  wider range of skill sets 


-  LiveOps ,  for example ,  boasts  pool of trained and certified at-home call agents capable of handling customer acquisition ,  customer service ,  fundraising and disaster recovery tasks for corporate buyers across  variety of industries 


-  ,  Engagement phase Engagement is the sourcing phase in which the buyer chooses one or more suppliers to carry out the work and establishes the contract terms 


-  In recruiting suppliers ,  the buyer needs to consider who is responsible for the selection process and what criteria the selection is based on 


-  On Elance ,  for example ,  buyers choose suppliers by evaluating project proposals; reviewing online resumes ,  portfolios and standardized skill test scores; studying feedback from prior engagements; and in some cases conducting online interviews 


-  The platform then handles all aspects of supplier selection 


-  In both Facilitator and Governor scenarios ,  careful attention to verifying the counterparty capabilities is crucial ,  as ,  once chosen ,  the supplier or the platform assumes responsibility for the job 


-  These models typically allow suppliers to self-select work on  posted project 


-  For example ,  the grand challenges on InnoCentive  highly complex scientific problems requiring top-level expertise  can carry awards in excess of $1 million ,  whereas  simple human intelligence task on Amazon MTurk ,  such as data entry ,  may pay 10 cents 


-  ,  Operational phase With suppliers lined up and terms negotiated ,  the buyer shifts its focus to executing the sourcing initiative 


-  That never works 


-  Unless the parties are to commit the time for interaction and communication ,  the result is not going to be good and buyers are not going to be happy 


-  ,  The Aggregator model ,  with its focus on parallel microtask processing ,  requires less ongoing coordination 


-  Consider ,  for example ,  collecting categorized product instances from workers on Amazon MTurk and storing them in  product database 


-  Most of the coordination in this case is implicit  through highly structured tasks  and the buyer-supplier relationship is arms-length with minimal ongoing interaction 


-  Some Aggregator platforms and third-party companies enable coordination via workflow 


-  Smartling ,   New York-based company that manages translation services for websites and mobile apps through its own platform ,  has built workflow tasks that streamline the translation process and reduce the overall task duration 


-  For example ,  when  supplier hired on Elance for  translation job submits  translated document ,  the buyer must have the necessary skills to review and assess the quality of the translation 


-  Here ,  the buyer must assess the quality of  large number of tasks completed by  pool of suppliers 


-  Amazon MTurk ,  for example ,  employs  reputation system that evaluates suppliers over time 


-  Others ,  like microtask crowdsourcing company CrowdFlower ,  allow buyers to mix test tasks into the workload and reject input from suppliers that fail the tests 


-  Choosing from multiple options makes it easier for the buyer to pick the deliverable that fits its requirements best 


-  This may be especially helpful in situations where quality is more subjective 


-  Consider ,  for example ,  the common task of developing  logo 


-  Comparing multiple designs submitted by individual designers helps the buyer realize which logo best represents its vision for the venture 


-  While the buyer can respond via financial penalties and negative feedback ,  these are of little consolation in the case of time-critical projects 


-  Project failure under the Governor model is similar ,  but the responsible counterparty here is the platform ,  not the end supplier ,  thus increasing the leverage of threatened penalties and legal means against an underperforming supplier 


-  Of the four platform models ,  the Aggregator model  with jobs typically comprised of mundane ,  repetitive microtasks  presents the least risks to IP 


-  ,  In contrast ,  the Arbitrator model presents the greatest IP challenge 


-  On the one hand ,  typical Arbitrator jobs ,  such as industrial design or scientific challenges ,  require highly skilled suppliers; on the other ,  the competition model assumes that multiple  ( often numerous )  suppliers have access to all project-related information 


-  ,  Arbitrators control IP-related risks in  number of ways 


-  TopCoder ,  for instance ,  can make all competitions within the game plan private and conduct background checks on participating coders 


-  The person in charge will also need to know how to atomize processes and tasks as well as coordinate and handle input from  number of small ,  diverse ,  geographically remote suppliers ,  often with different cultural backgrounds 


-  New human cloud models now offer imaginative solutions to overcome coordination and control barriers involved in dealing with scale  with  large number of microsuppliers 


-  We are already seeing evidence that some large corporations around the globe are beginning to take advantage of these platforms ,  mainly in the IT arena ,  but with adoption slowly migrating to other areas as well 


-  ,  Unlike past sourcing waves ,  the human cloud will also dramatically benefit small buyers ,  the largely neglected long tail of global sourcing 


-   human cloud should prove to be an equalizer for small businesses ,  allowing firms like Rief Media to compete with large companies that in the past have had the advantage of economies of scale 


-  The human cloud will reshape the outsourcing landscape much as cloud computing is reshaping the software industry 


-  Moreover ,  traditional labor-market middlemen are starting to perceive the threat of disintermediation ,  as human cloud platforms undermine their traditional strengths in providing local short-term labor 


-  ,  In the coming years ,  we expect that human cloud platforms will innovate in three directions: task decomposition ,  real-time work and social governance 


-  Managers will be able to easily create workflows of tasks performed internally with tasks performed externally by  human cloud ,  leading to the disruption of the business process outsourcing industry 


-  Advances in real-time crowdsourcing ,  where workers are paid  retainer to remain on call for work requests ,  will enable new forms of cloud sourcing 


-  Finally ,  social governance techniques ,  which allow the best workers to manage ,  train and approve the work of others ,  will continue to evolve 


-  ,  Today ,  the human cloud is  small part of the global sourcing landscape
