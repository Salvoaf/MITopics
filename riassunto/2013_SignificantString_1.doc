- Can you and your team members articulate in  few short sentences the underlying reason that brought your project into existence? If you cant ,  youre not alone: We have observed that in many corporate projects ,  team members cannot explain the point of what they are doing  and as  result ,  their projects are likely to fail 


-  Whenever we observe  project team in trouble  frustrated ,  laden with conflict and struggling to deliver results  we ask members to articulate what compelled their project into existence in the first place 


-  To our continuing surprise ,  we often discover these teams have not even discussed ,  let alone agreed on ,  why they are pursuing the project 


-  ,  Not being able to articulate why the project is being done puts it at risk of losing support and momentum and decreases its chances of success 


-  The lack of  clear and compelling why statement leaves  project with  blurred focus ,  and the initiative with  weak internal and external project brand  that is ,   poor or questionable reputation both within the organization and with its external stakeholders 


-  In this article ,  we argue that the best way to begin building that project brand is with  well-articulated ,  problem-focused why statement 


-  The why statement serves as  useful tool that aligns the efforts of team members ,  leaders and other stakeholders ,  and it helps maintain support through all five project branding phases ,  from pitch to payoff 


-  ,  The ASRS story provides  cautionary tale for project leaders:  project without  clear and compelling why can lead to wasted effort ,  missed project objectives ,  dissatisfied clients ,  poor business performance ,  demoralized team members and damage to the reputations of the team leader and the project 


-  We know many cases just like it 


-  Building on our more than 20 years of work with teams and organizations ,  we have identified several factors that distract or impede teams from understanding and describing the reasons behind their projects 


-  We also recommend tactics to help make those reasons  unifying thread throughout the life of  project 


-  )  ,  The why statement is  pivotal element in any projects brand 


-  Without  solid why ,   team can become overwhelmed by conflict and confusion ,  and all-important supporters can and will direct their attention elsewhere 


-   project pitched with  clear and compelling why will inspire people to feel the project is worth the time and effort 


-  Whats more ,   solid why helps the organization stay focused on the reasons for continuing to support the project 


-  ,  Over the years ,  we have repeatedly observed patterns and behaviors that cause project leaders ,  teams and sponsors to fail to identify  solid why before they launch their projects 


-  In some instances ,  teams leap into action before they have explored all the possible motivations for  project 


-  In others ,   shared why never emerges because individuals or groups are unwilling to engage in discussions that might involve conflict or expose hidden agendas that other team members might not embrace 


- 10 We have also worked with teams who see  solution only in terms of the fix they know and ,  from the outset ,  will pursue  familiar course of action ,  although it may not address the real problem 


-  )  ,  Given the tendency of groups to overlook ,  sidestep or forget the why of  project ,  project leaders ,  team members ,  stakeholders and the organization can derive real benefits from developing  clear and succinct description of the reasons driving the initiative 


-  Most of the time ,   good why statement is the product of  lot of work and heated debate 


-  One tactic to help reveal the core problem is to ask in repeating fashion why the issue is important 


-  This is  variation of  widely used process-improvement technique known as Five Whys12 but differs in its direction of questioning in that it focuses on the problem and not its causes 


-   project leader needs to ask these repeated whys early in meetings with the sponsor or customer ,  and always through the lens of the overall question ,  Why is this important to customers and the organization? These might also be thought of as So what? questions 


-  ,  The following exchange ,  from an Argentinian company we will call Sport Diamante  ( not its real name )  ,  is derived from  real project situation and illustrates the value of the technique: ,  Only through repeated and deeper probes has the project leader discerned the core business problem driving the project  one that explains to team members ,  stakeholders and the larger organization why they should care about the situation and ,  more importantly ,  why they should devote energy to doing something about it 


-  There are no rules regarding the number of Why is this important? queries ,  except to persevere until the reason articulated is  critical business issue that can rally team members and other important constituents 


-  Managers often are too quick to define  problem in terms of  familiar solution  ( for example ,  lack of  distribution center )  and dont realize until too late that they havent actually addressed the underlying gap between actual and desired performance 


-  For example ,  if  team defines  problem as a serious bottleneck in step two of the process ,  we push members to describe why  bottleneck in step two is important to customers 


-  Both of these customer-oriented whys offer team members the perspective to keep open minds about causes  ( of which the bottleneck might be one )  and ,  more importantly ,  what  solution might look like 


-  ,  Location is the second dimension of an effective why statement and answers the question ,  Where do we see the problem? Where can refer to  physical location  ( for example ,   country ,  city or facility )  ,   market segment ,   product category ,   machine or  process step 


-  For this example ,  the why driving the project and the solution that eventually evolves need not address sales challenges in Argentina or other South American markets  only Brazil  and must be applicable to all product lines 


-  Knowing when the problem began  ( for instance ,  delivery problems were first reported six months ago )  and when the problem occurs  ( for example ,  delivery problems have persisted continuously but peak near the end of each month )  can provide guidance regarding where to look for  cause 


-  Answers to questions regarding magnitude are critical to establishing project urgency and the scale and resource requirements of an appropriate response 


-  ,  ,  The four dimensions of  why statement provide  structured description of the business gap that drives the project 


-  )   why statement should be developed early in the gestation of  project  before significant resources are misdirected toward  poorly defined issue that is not the real problem 


-  ,  The key benefit of the four-element why statement is that it specifies the parameters of the gap in  way that can help the team avoid some common biases and errors 


-  For example ,  the why statement for the Sport Diamante scenario might be summarized as: Brazil constituted 40% of our business six months ago ,  but its share is falling fast 


-  ,  Observe that the Sport Diamante why statement is fact-based and does not suggest  solution ,  speculate about causes or attempt to cast blame on individuals 


-  We frequently see these types of biases in why statements ,  even those coming from experienced project teams 


-  In the case of Sport Diamante ,  these misdirects might have played out as follows: ,  To be sure ,  not all project why statements begin with problems  some are spawned by opportunities  ( for example ,  new business ventures ,  new market entries )  


- 13 )  Perhaps it is simply  matter of how we phrase it  as  gap to be addressed or  vision to be fulfilled 


-  Building on decision-making research as well as our own field-based observations ,  we advise teams to aim for problem-oriented why statements ,  not opportunity statements 


-  Psychologists have found that decision makers tend to be more compelled by the potential loss  the problem  ( for example ,  If we dont do  ,  our competitors will steal 75% of the growing Asian market )   than by the upside opportunity  ( for example ,  If we do  ,  we can gain 75% of the Asian market )  


-  ,   team whose members take the time to develop  solid why statement and understand the importance of keeping it in clear view throughout the projects life cycle will avoid common errors that can derail the project
