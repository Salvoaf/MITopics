-  Markets ,  suppliers ,  competitors ,  technology ,  and customers are constantly shifting 


- Consequently ,  global business now requires all leaders to be explorers ,  guided by only the faintest glimmer of unfamiliar stars and excited by the opportunity and uncertainty of untapped markets 


-  In industries such as semiconductors ,  automobiles ,  commercial aircraft ,  telecommunications ,  computers ,  and consumer electronics ,  it is impossible to survive and not scan the world for competitors ,  customers ,  human resources ,  suppliers ,  and technology 


-  Fortune 500 firms we surveyed ,  85 percent do not think they have an adequate number of global leaders  ( see Figure  )  67 percent of the firms think that their existing leaders need additional skills and knowledge before they meet or exceed needed capabilities 


-  About two-thirds of the characteristics apply generically to leaders ,  regardless of their managerial position ,  corporate culture ,  industry norms ,  or country-of-origin management practices 


-  They are driven by  sense of adventure and  desire to see and experience new things 


-  ,  Global leaders stated repeatedly that inquisitiveness is the fuel for increasing their global savvy ,  enhancing their ability to understand people and maintain integrity ,  and augmenting their capacity for dealing with uncertainty and managing tensions 


-  Inquisitiveness enables global leaders to not only develop the characteristics of character ,  duality ,  and savvy ,  but also build  complex understanding of how all three work together 


-  ,   genuine emotional connection with people throughout the companys worldwide operations is  function of  three-step process:  (  )   sincere interest in and concern for others ,  (  )  an effort to really listen to people ,  and  (  )  an understanding of different viewpoints 


-  Leaders in the survey pointed out that understanding different viewpoints is not the same as embracing them but does lead to respecting them 


-  Ample opportunity exists for misunderstanding and taking and giving offense 


-  For example ,  willingness to communicate with host country nationals has been found to facilitate the cross-cultural adjustment of expatriates 


-  In turn ,  employees give leaders the benefit of the doubt on difficult matters ,  put forth their best efforts ,  and make sacrifices 


-  In global organizations with webs of interrelated units that must cooperate and coordinate to meet customer needs ,  goodwill  rather than clear lines of command and control  is what leaders need to achieve global initiatives  ( see the sidebar on Jon Huntsman )  


-  Successful global leaders indicated that integrity significantly increased the overall levels of trust throughout the organization 


-  They pointed out that when crossing cultural ,  national ,  functional ,  and business unit lines ,  trust is an essential ,  irreplaceable ingredient for effec tive execution 


-  They were quick to add that quite often the difference between winners and losers in global competition is great execution ,  not great strategy ,  and added that for great execution ,  you need employees trust and commitment 


-  However ,  around the world ,  employees and customers alike trust managers who conduct business above board and on the basis of business merit  ( see the sidebar on Lane Cook )  


-  ,  Global leaders embrace duality by managing uncertainty ,  essentially knowing when to act and when to gather more information ,  and balancing tensions ,  understanding what needs to change and what needs to stay the same from country to country and region to region 


-  Research on expatriates has found that crossing from ones home culture into  foreign one creates significant uncertainty and that those who have  reasonably high tolerance for ambiguity tend to cope and adjust better 


-  To recognize new market opportunities ,  to arbitrage opportunities involving cost and quality differences across company affiliates ,  and to maximize efficiencies by reducing redundancies ,  global leaders must understand competitive conditions 


-  They also understand international disciplines such as finance ,  accounting ,  marketing ,  operations ,  human resource management ,  and strategy 


-  ,  Global leaders ,  like great musicians or athletes ,  need superior talent ,  abundant opportunity ,  and excellent education and training to succeed 


-  Not everyone has the ability to become one ,  so companies should not give opportunity and education to just anyone 


-  ,  How are global leaders made? The basic mental process for development is to understand the whole world ,  not just one country 


-  ,  We might consider the example of one Americans seemingly simple trip to  traditional Japanese restaurant 


-  We need to understand people of different ethics and demonstrate integrity in  way that inspires trust 


-  One reason that inquisitiveness differentiates between successful global leaders and those who struggle with worldwide responsibilities is that it ignites and fuels the motivation to go through this mind-altering process 


-  This led to the invention of an innovative plastic ball into which  customer pours the detergent; it evenly distributes the detergent through little holes 


- 15 Contrasting views and values can force members to think globally 


-  Tracy Billbrough ,  president of Black  Decker Eastern Hemisphere ,  felt that the global team experience helped him better understand how to connect emotionally with people from different cultural backgrounds and appreciate why those connections aided in successful implementation 


-  People with no global leadership potential have such thick heads they do not even realize when they have hit them and hence learn nothing from the assignment 


-  Those with little potential realize that they have hit their heads ,  but they go back to being just as they were before the mishap and learn almost nothing 


-  When unexpectedly hit in the head ,  people with significant talent do not ignore it ,  do not try to simply reconstruct their original mind-sets ,  and do not create unique mental maps for each new situation and country 


-  Begin by thinking about how the person and the company will use the international experience in the future 


-  Companies need to retain people to leverage their international development 


-  They provide the opportunity to use international experience and allow for reasonable autonomy in the first job following repatriation
