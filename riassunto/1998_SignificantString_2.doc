-  At an operational level ,  Adamson worked on improving manufacturing quality and restoring the confidence of major customers 


-  Product development responsibility officially lay with headquarters  ( HQ )  in Dayton ,  Ohio ,  but Adamson began directing his resources toward upgrading and renewing the Dundee product line to meet the emerging demands of its key customers ,  the big British banks 


-  By 1984 ,  Dundee had 20 percent of market share worldwide ,  and by 1985 ,  headquarters officially transferred responsibility for the global ATM business to Dundee 


-  ,  The NCR Dundee case is typical of what we call subsidiary initiative: the proactive and deliberate pursuit of  new business opportunity by  subsidiary company ,  undertaken with  view to expand the subsidiarys scope of responsibility in  manner consistent with the MNCs strategic goals 


-  Subsidiary initiative is important for two reasons 


-  Our research also revealed  subtle shift in the locus of responsibility between headquarters and subsidiaries 


-  Initiative is  sign that subsidiary managers are beginning to take responsibility for their operations destiny ,  which in turn suggests the need for  more central role for subsidiary units in the implementation of corporate strategy 


-  It involved the identification of new or enhanced business opportunities through interaction with customers ,  suppliers ,  and government entities in the subsidiarys marketplace 


-  ,  External initiatives arose typically out of customers unmet demands in the local marketplace 


-  We saw several variants on this theme: ,  No less critical than the identification of an interesting business opportunity was the need for  relatively high degree of autonomy in the subsidiary 


-  Typically he or she was the individual who identified the business opportunity in the first place ,  although sometimes the subsidiarys general manager took ownership of the project because of its importance 


-  Then ,  as the project took shape ,  they sought out allies  typically local customers who were interested in buying the product or service ,  but sometimes ,  also ,  personal contacts or mentors in the home office 


-  ,  Second ,  the subsidiary had to have ,  or be prepared to work hard for ,   reputation as  trustworthy and reliable operation 


-  ,  We observed two additional tactics with regard to internal initiatives 


-  The two parties negotiated  deal whereby the Toronto plant would swap its other manufacturing responsibilities for the exclusive production of zone valves and fan-and-limit devices 


-  No new products resulted ,  and no immediate new customers 


-  The cake was simply split in  different way ,  with the subsidiary getting  larger slice 


-  As Gordon Brown ,  the controller of IBMs Greenock plant commented ,  By extending the value chain and linking various activities together in one location ,  we saved millions of dollars ,  improved customer satisfaction ,  and increased market share 


-  But guaranteed sales can make  plant lazy ,  and before long the internal customer is putting up with  substandard product or an inflated price from its supplier 


-  The same principle applies to other value-adding activities 


-  We believe that some subsidiaries ,  by virtue of their history ,  their local environment ,  or their management ,  will pursue market development roles ,  while others ,  for equally circumstantial reasons ,  will pursue network optimization roles 


-  First ,  it suggests that many value-adding activities that MNCs are undertaking are contestable ,  that is ,  potentially ,  they could be performed by  number of different units 


-  Of course ,   lot of activities are firmly embedded in their local environment ,  or they are so large and asset-specific that they could not be practically moved 


-  But ,  in the course of our study ,  as we saw examples of manufacturing ,  development ,  logistics ,  marketing ,  and business management activities change locations ,  we concluded that much of what is done inside the MNC is neutral with regard to physical location 


-  ,  Faced with such changes ,  many subsidiary managers we interviewed were thinking hard about their futures 


-  Using such an approach ,  some people argued that only those subsidiaries at the more evolved end of the spectrum should take initiative 


-  Those units ,  they argued ,  had the capabilities on which to base further development ,  and the management expertise necessary to drive initiatives to completion 


-  ,  We found considerable evidence to support this perspective 


-  When asked why they had not pursued initiatives ,  typically they answered ,  We focus exclusively on meeting the needs of our local customers ,  or It is not appropriate for us at this stage ,  or It is very difficult because of the level of centralization in the corporation 


-  subsidiary were typical in this regard 


-  Eventually ,  the subsidiary had the self-confidence and legitimacy to pursue more significant initiatives 


-  If the objective of initiative is to identify and pursue new opportunities ,  how can corporate executives know in advance where those opportunities will arise? If the Japanese ,  German ,  and British subsidiaries are charged with market development and network optimization ,  what happens to the great new business opportunity that the Italian manager spots? We believe that every subsidiary needs to have  latent entrepreneurial role ,  so they can pursue opportunities wherever they arise 


-  Initiatives could spring up in areas that lay far beyond the corporations business domain ,  and head-office managers could be inundated with proposals that made little or no strategic sense 


-  Clearly ,  MNCs need control systems to constrain the number of poorly thought-out initiatives ,  but ,  increasingly ,  such systems should be based on the development of  shared understanding of the corporations strategic priorities ,  rather than on intervention into subsidiary affairs 


-  Within those limits ,  they have free rein to pursue opportunities as they see fit ,  on the assumption that they understand their operation and the local marketplace better than executives sitting in  distant head office 


-  Control systems are necessary to make it work ,  but the philosophy of empowerment underlying this model shifts the headquarters-subsidiary relationship from one of mutual suspicion and interference toward one of trust and shared destiny 


-  Some managers felt that subsidiary initiative was simply more trouble than it was worth 


-  The interpretation will depend  lot on whether there is  strong level of trust between the individuals in question 


-  As one manager in our study pointed out ,  No one in the head office wakes up thinking about what they can do in Canada today 


-  That responsibility lies with the subsidiary manager 


-  This does not mean abandoning the tried-and-tested systems by which they evaluate new proposals ,  but it does call for  change in attitude that will encourage more subsidiary managers to bring their initiatives forward for consideration 


-  Again ,   few points to consider: ,  We set out to explore the strategies that subsidiary managers used in pursuit of initiative ,  understand the forms of resistance they typically encountered ,  and assess the implications of initiative for MNC management 


-  We encourage the executives of multinational corporations to consider ways to foster the changing behaviors that enable initiatives to flourish
