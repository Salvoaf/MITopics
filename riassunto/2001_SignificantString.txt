- You are on  crowded elevator standing next to  couple of executives from  company with offices on the floor just above yours 


-  They are talking in low tones about  surprise announcement coming the next day 


-  Their firm ,  AGA Software ,  is being sold to  big ,  famous technology company! My options are going to be worth millions! you hear one of them whisper to the other 


-  Assuming AGA is  publicly traded stock ,  can you run home and buy AGA shares without breaking the law? Knowing when you can legally trade on inside information and when you cannot is tricky 


-  This article will help you better understand the legal minefield 


-  Securities and Exchange Commission for civil cases and the  


-  Department of Justice for criminal cases )  must prove several specific elements to convict someone for trading on or tipping confidential corporate information 


-  Second ,  the trade must have been prompted by the possession of material ,  nonpublic information 


-  Third ,  the defendant ,  whether  trader or tipper ,  must know that the information he or she is dealing with is hot property 


-  Finally ,  insiders must be breaching  fiduciary duty owed to their corporation when they trade on or tip confidential corporate information 


-  This stipulation almost always means that an insider cannot trade on such information and cannot tip others about it if the insider stands to gain by doing so 


-  ,  Lets do  quick legal analysis of our elevator case 


-  First ,  if you buy the AGA shares ,  there clearly will be  purchase of securities 


-  It would be different if you had been planning to sell AGA shares you already owned but decided not to after overhearing the conversation 


-  The law does not penalize  failure to buy or  decision to hold 


-  ,  Second ,  was the information you overheard both nonpublic and material? Yes 


-  The executives were speaking in low tones on the elevator about an announcement to be made tomorrow 


-  And the authorities can prove materiality if  reasonable investor would consider the information important in  decision to buy or sell 


-  The average investor would certainly consider the acquisition announcement important 


-  ,  Third ,  did you know that the information is hot? It seems so 


-  The executives low tones led you to understand that this was  highly confidential matter 


-  ,  Finally ,  does the executives loose talk ,  followed by your trading ,  involve  breach of fiduciary duty? You are not an employee of AGA ,  so you do not have any of the duties to it that an employee would 


-  Finally ,  you are not  family member of any such person 


-  ,  But what about the AGA executives? They have duties to AGA ,  but they are not tipping this hot information to you as part of  trading ring in which you and they will share the spoils 


-  They gain nothing from their carelessness 


-  Is it self-interested? No 


-  ,  So you are free to trade 


-  Of course ,  your actions may spark the interest of securities regulators who monitor unusual trading activity before announcements like this 


-  ,  Now lets change just one fact 


-  Imagine you know one of the AGA executives ,  and this person deliberately whispers the secret information to you on that elevator ride 


-  Over the past few years you and your friend have periodically sent business to and done favors for each other ,  but neither of you has ever given the other  stock tip 


-  Can you trade now? ,  On the surface ,  things still look relatively innocent 


-  Your friend appears to be making you  gift of this information in the hopes that you  but not he  will profit from it 


-  Like the strangers on the elevator ,  he is  blabbermouth ,  but although he has violated his duty to keep company secrets ,  he does not stand to profit from your trade 


-  Is his tip really  pure gift? Or is it part of an ongoing ,  mutually advantageous business or personal relationship? If  tip is part of  flow of favors running between parties ,  the authorities have all they need to make an insider-trading case stick 


-  Your friend clearly violated his duty by revealing company secrets ,  and he stands to gain personally from the eventual quid pro quo you will throw him  whether in the form of  reciprocal tip ,   business referral or help getting his kid into college 


-  In other words ,  his breach of duty was accompanied by the prospect of personal gain 


-  Your informants self-interest makes all the difference 


-  Suppose your friend is an editor for Business Week 


-  His inside information is that Business Week will be ranking innovative software firms in its next issue ,  and placing AGA first in its category 


-  The news is sure to drive the price of AGA stock up sharply 


-  Can you buy AGA shares based on that tip? ,  No 


-  The law treats all secret information that might affect  stocks price the same way ,  whether that information is good or bad and whether it originates from the firm itself ,   business publication or  Wall Street research department 


-  Business reporters ,  securities analysts ,  Wall Street printers ,  investment bankers and many other professionals have been snared when they traded on or tipped others about privileged information belonging to their employers 


-  ,  Rounding out  working knowledge of insider-trading law are three special situations 


-  First ,  confidential information related to  proposed tender offer  such as  hostile takeover  is too hot to handle no matter how innocently it comes to you 


-  The law treats information about tender offers very strictly 


-  The second concerns stock owned through employee stock-purchase plans ,  etc 


-  As an employee ,  you are sure to know some confidential inside information ,  so how can you legally sell your stock? Under  new rule ,  securities regulators have created  safe harbor for employees 


-  Employees who file selling plans with the SEC can sell their stock regularly on  set date  ( such as the first Monday of every month for one year )  


-  This avoids any risk of insider-trading liability 


-  This is  formal technical procedure ,  so ask your companys lawyers for advice 


-  ,  The third situation applies to corporate officers ,  directors and those owning 10% or more of the shares of  firm 


-  In those cases ,   special ,  additional rule requires  six-month wait between any purchase and subsequent sale or sale and subsequent purchase 


-  If you sell shares on Jan 


-   ,  you must wait until June 30 to buy  and vice versa 


-  The rule applies whether or not you know any company secrets 


-  ,  Making money on the basis of inside information can get you into big trouble ,  but there are times when it is legal 


-  So if you find yourself sitting next to  highly placed but loose-lipped stranger in  bar who wants to make you  gift of inside information ,  take it if you want 


-  But dont start buying your new friend drinks every happy hour 


-  This payback is what transforms  random tip or overheard conversation into an illegal insider-trading ring 


-  If you have any doubts about what to do ,  consult  legal expert or ,  even better ,  just dont trade 


-  Life is too short to spend even  small part of it with federal investigators 


-  Vague hopes about bits for atoms and demassification are naive at best ,  echoes of talk about paperless offices 20 years ago 


-  Globalization is destroying the last remnants of stewardship for natural resources in industries such as forest products: Today ,  buy-and-sell decisions are executed by faceless agents living on the other side of the world from the people and ecosystems whose futures they decide 


-  According to the World Bank ,  the poorest quartile of humankind has seen its share of global income fall from  


- 25% over the past 25 years 


-  Individuals and small circles of friends carve out increasingly private lives amidst increasingly distrustful strangers ,  preferring to bowl alone 


-  National Academy of Sciences home secretary Peter Raven says ,  quoting the Wildlife Conservation Society's George Schaller ,  We cannot afford another century like the last one 


-  ,  Equally important ,  BP looks at the situation as  business opportunity 


-  Since 1997 ,  the company has become active in public forums on global climate ,  has begun to reduce emissions in exploration and production ,  has started to market cleaner fuels and has invested significantly in alternative sources of energy  ( such as photovoltaic power and hydrogen )  


-  All the while ,  Browne has led an effort to build  more performance-oriented culture ,  and company profits have been at an all-time high 


-  Appliance maker Electrolux uses water- and powder-based paints  ( rather than hazardous solvent-based paints )  ,  prioritizes the use of recycled materials ,  and has introduced the world's first family of refrigerators and freezers free of the chlorofluorocarbons that contribute to ozone depletion 


-  In 1999 ,  Toyota and Honda began selling hybrid cars that combine internal combustion and electric propulsion ,  perform comparably to competitors  and can achieve up to 70 miles per gallon today ,  with prospects for two to three times that mileage in  few years 


-  In 1998 ,  Xerox introduced its first fully digitized copier ,  the Document Centre 265 ,  which is more than 90% remanufacturable and 97% recyclable 


-  The product has only about 200 parts ,  an order of magnitude less than its predecessor 


-  According to Fortune ,  remanufacturing and waste reduction saved Xerox $250 million in 1998 


-  billion manufacturer of commercial carpet tiles ,  which saved about $140 million in sustainable waste reductions from 1995 to 1999 ,  are even rethinking their basic business model 


-  Interface's goal is to stop selling product altogether 


-  Nonetheless ,  business can play  legitimate leadership role as  catalyst for larger changes 


-  We believe that  new environmentalism is emerging ,  driven by innovation ,  not regulation  radical new technologies ,  products ,  processes and business models 


-  More and more businesses are recognizing the opportunities this creates 


-  Sustainability not only helps improve the world ,  but also energizes the company ,  says ABB's CEO Goran Lindahl 


-  ,  The good news is that change through market-driven innovation is the type of change our society understands best 


-  The problem is that much in today's business climate appears to run in the opposite direction 


-  Short-term financial pressures ,  the free-agent work force ,  dramatic opportunities to start new companies and get rich quickly ,  often cynical mass media ,  and industrializing countries aspiring to catch up to the industrialized world's consumption standards  these hardly seem like the conditions for increasing stewardship of the earth 


-  ,  The challenge today is to develop sustainable businesses that are compatible with the current economic reality 


-  Innovative business models and products must work financially ,  or it won't matter how good they are ecologically and socially 


-  To explore how to achieve this ,  the SoL Sustainability Consortium was formed to bring together like-minded corporate executives experienced in organizational learning who also see sustainability becoming  cornerstone of their business strategy 


-  Together ,  we are asking: Can organizations committed to sustainability work with the forces propelling most of the New Economy in the opposite direction? And ,  can organizational-learning principles and tools help in realizing the changes that this will require? ,  The first reality confronting businesses that are serious about sustainability is ambiguity ,  starting with the question: What do we mean by sustainability? The ambiguity inherent in sustainability has deep cultural roots 


-  In  sense ,  sustainability requires letting go of the story of the supremacy of the human in nature ,  the story that the natural world exists as mere resources to serve human progress 


-  But most of us grew up with this story ,  and it is still shared by the vast majority of modern society 


-  It is not easy to let it go ,  especially when we are uncertain about what the new story will be 


-  They have let go of  secure worldview without knowing what they can hang on to 


-  We are just beginning to explore what it means to be part of  universe that is alive  


-  Echoing Barry ,  Roger Saillant ,  former Ford executive and now Visteon vice president ,  says ,  The new story will have to do with personal accountability  


-  new communities in business and elsewhere based on knowing that there is no parent to take care of us and that we have  stewardship responsibility for future generations 


-  It has often been framed as environmentalists against business 


-  Only by embracing all three can we begin to understand what sustainability actually means 


-  This is what life-sciences writer Janine Benyus calls biomimicry ,  innovation inspired by understanding how living systems work 


-  Why should we expect businesses to violate the law of zero waste? ,  All living systems follow cycles: produce ,  recycle ,  regenerate 


-  ,  By contrast ,  industrial-age systems follow  linear flow of extract ,  produce ,  sell ,  use ,  discard  what Ecology of Commerce author Paul Hawken calls take-make-waste 


-  )  ,  Indeed ,  the primary output of today's production processes is waste 


-  Across all industries ,  less than 10% of everything extracted from the earth  ( by weight )  becomes usable products 


-  So ,  while businesses obsess over labor and financial capital efficiency ,  we have created possibly the most inefficient system of production in human history 


-  )  This implies three specific waste-reduction strategies: resource productivity ,  clean products ,  and remanufacturing ,  recycling and composting 


-  Remanufacturing and recycling  ( creating technical nutrients )  and designing more products that are biodegradable  ( creating natural nutrients )  reduce waste from discard 


-  They would do fewer things that compromise regeneration ,  such as paving over wetlands ,  and would invest some surpluses in restoring natural capital  for example ,  companies like Interface plant trees to match business miles traveled because increasing forest cover reduces greenhouse gases 


-  That is good in some ways ,  but troubling in others 


-  Indeed ,  most companies investing in cost-reducing ecoefficiency improvements are doing so with the aim of increased profits and growth 


-  In today's global capital markets ,  greater profits show up as investment capital that could easily be reinvested in old-style eco-inefficient industries 


-  Ecoefficiency gains are laudable but dangerously incomplete ,  as is any strategy that fails to consider the industrial-natural system as  whole 


-  Increased natural-resource productivity that translates directly into lower costs offers  compelling business case ,  one that does not challenge established thinking deeply 


-  However ,  focusing on ecoefficiency may distract companies from pursuing radically different products and business models  changes that require shifts in mental models ,  not just shifting attention within existing mental models 


-  The premise of work on learning organizations has been that thriving in today's knowledge-based marketplaces means reversing the destructiveness that Deming speaks about and cultivating people's drive to learn 


-  Already aware of the team's innovations in design for remanufacture  ( more than 500 patents came from the Lakes project )  and the product's success in the marketplace ,  we learned about how the team's zero-waste vision translated into  manufacturing facility with virtually no waste and eventually became embraced by many of the team's suppliers 


-  ,  Late in the day ,  Rhonda Staudt ,   young engineer who was one of the lead designers ,  was talking about the team's innovations when she was interrupted by David Berdish ,  veteran of many organizational-learning projects at Ford 


-  Rhonda ,  Berdish said ,  I understand what  great opportunity this was for you and how exciting it was 


-  What  mean is: What was the stand you took and who were you taking that stand for?  ,  Rhonda looked at David for  long time in silence and then ,  in front of many peers and  few superiors ,  began to cry 


-  ,  We have all spent much of our lives in institutions that force us to be someone we are not 


-  We commit ourselves to the company's agenda 


-  The poet David Whyte quotes an AT&T manager who wrote ,  Ten years ago ,   turned my face for  moment  


-  They want to increase imagination and creativity without unleashing the passion that comes from personal vision 


-  There is  difference between building more-sustainable enterprises because there is profit in it and because it is one's life's work 


-  ,  If understanding natural systems establishes the guiding ideas for sustainability innovations ,  then learning provides the means to translate ideas into accomplishments 


-  But ,  in fact ,  it is based on  different type of control 


-  It favors intangibles  ideas ,  information and relationships 


-  But he suggests that the real changes are not ultimately about technology but communication 


- 13 ,  Today ,  perhaps the earth as  living system is communicating to us through increasingly turbulent weather patterns 


-  Are we listening? If the New Economy is revolutionizing communication ,  can it enable deeper listening? If so ,  we may discern  new business logic emerging ,  one that starts with rethinking how firms create value and continues by redefining customers ,  employees ,  suppliers  and ultimately the company itself 


-  The traditional company produced something that it then had to sell 


-  Today ,  we must understand  customer and serve  genuine need 


-  ,  At the heart of the industrial-age growth machine was  kind of mass hypnosis  convincing consumers that happiness meant owning  new thing 


-  ,  What does it mean to create new business models on the basis of that understanding? For Interface ,  it means shifting from selling carpets to providing floor-covering services ,  automatically taking back worn carpet tiles or replacing entire sections if  customer wants  different color 


-  For Carrier ,  the world's leading manufacturer of air-conditioning equipment ,  it means renting cooling services rather than selling air conditioners 


-  For IKEA ,  according to its published mission statement ,  it means providing services to help people make  house or apartment into  home rather than selling furniture 


-  All these firms believe that higher profits will come from providing better solutions rather than selling more equipment ,  in the words of Natural Capitalism authors Amory and Hunter Lovins and Paul Hawken 


-  ,  From the standpoint of sustainability ,  providing services rather than just selling products creates  potential new alignment between what is sound economically and what is sound environmentally 


-   company's business model no longer requires designed-in obsolescence to push customers into buying new products 


-  Swiss industry analyst Walter Stahel and chemist Braungart have proposed that ,  in the future ,  producers will own what they produce forever and therefore will have strong incentives to design products to be disassembled and remanufactured or recycled ,  whichever is more economical 


-  ,  Such ideas signal  radical shift in business models ,  one that will not come easily 


-  It starts with how  company thinks of itself in relation to its customers: as  producer of things people buy or  provider of services through products made and remade? Marketing strategist Sandra Vandermerwe argues that such  view is essential to true customer focus ,  providing value for customers as well as obtaining value from customers 


-  As Volvo discovered years ago ,  when  company is only selling cars ,  its relationship with the customer ends with the purchase 


-  When it is providing customer satisfaction ,  it just begins 


-  Thirty years ago ,  futurist Alvin Toffler coined the term prosumer ,  people who actively participate in generating the value they derive from any product 


- 15 Today ,  prosumers are everywhere ,  says Kelly ,  from restaurants where you assemble your own dinner to medical self-care arenas ,  where you serve as doctor and patient 


-  As Kelly says ,  the essence of prosumerism today is that customers have  hand in the creation of the product 


- 16 ,  Prosumerism is infiltrating diverse marketplaces ,  especially those where Internet technology is strong 


-  The five-year-old magazine Fast Company now rivals Business Week ,  Fortune and Forbes ,  partly because of its Company of Friends ,   Web-site feature that allows subscribers to get together to discuss common concerns ,  form support networks for projects ,  or tell the magazine their interests 


-  I can go to our Web site and determine which are the 10 most frequently forwarded articles ,  says editor Alan Webber 


-  Ramaswamy ,  consumers have increasingly been engaging themselves in an active and explicit dialogue with manufacturers of products and services 


-  Or ,  as the popular Cluetrain Manifesto puts it ,  the market is becoming a community of discourse 


- 18 With the inmates running the asylum ,  will they start to change the rules? What if people start talking to one another? What if they talk about the state of the world and how different types of products affect the quality of people's lives? ,  Leading Web-based companies ,  because they relate to their customers differently ,  also gain  different sense of what truly concerns customers 


-  Without  doubt ,  sustainability of our current lifestyle  personally and environmentally  matters to  lot of our readers ,  says Webber 


-  These were among the concerns that motivated us to start the magazine ,  and we've seen nothing to persuade us otherwise 


-  Could this be another form of centralized control that becomes history ,  the victim of the freer flow of information and interaction that allows people to know more and learn faster? ,  Homo sapiens has been around longer than Homo consumer 


-  For  company that sells the image of fitness ,  it is not surprising that Darcy Winslow ,  general manager of sustainable products and services ,  says: Corporations in the 21st century cannot be fit if we don't prioritize and neutralize our impact on the environment 


-  ,  From Compliant Employees to Committed Members of Social Networks There are few companies today that do not struggle with the implications of the free-agent work force 


-  They offer stock 


-  ,  In 1991 ,  IKEA faced the daunting challenge of extending its European business success to North America ,  the graveyard of European retailers 


-  Achieving strong returns for  distant corporate office was not enough 


-  Being part of  proud and widely imitated European firm had limited meaning 


-  Eventually ,  some 20 , 000 IKEA employees in North America and Europe participated voluntarily in  two-day training session on The Natural Step ,  an intuitive introduction to the system conditions that must be met by  sustainable society 


-  Not only did that engage people in selling the company's environmentally oriented products and creating related product and service ideas ,  it engaged them in working for IKEA 


-  ,  The free-agent image connotes to many employers lack of commitment ,  people seeking  purely transactional relationship with  company 


-  In  very tough business environment ,  it really matters to people who have many options in their lives 


-  ,  Most industrial-age companies wanted what they regarded as committed employees 


-  Today ,  the definition of commitment is changing ,  and paternalism is giving way to more-adult relationships 


- People stay with  firm ,  in many instances ,  because they see an alignment between their personal values and those they perceive the firm to be committed to ,  says Ged Davis ,  who is Shell's vice president for global business environment 


-  If enterprises are not committed to anything beyond making money ,  why should managers be surprised that workers make transactional commitments? ,  Kelly also notes that in the competitive labor markets found in fast-growing industries ,  people change companies but maintain their loyalty to advancing technology or to the region 


-  One key person may take groups of people from employer to employer like the Pied Piper 


- 21 ,  From Separate Businesses to Ecological Communities The great benefits reaped by the New Economy in the coming decades ,  says Kelly ,  will be due in large part to exploring and exploiting the power of decentralized and autonomous networks ,  which in many ways now resemble an ecology of organisms ,  interlinked and coevolving ,  constantly in flux ,  deeply entangled ,  ever expanding at its edges 


-  ,  In traditional businesses ,  everything was piecework ,  says Zoho's Ho 


-  Now we are all part of larger systems ,  and our success depends on understanding those systems 


-  Today ,  cost may be only one of several criteria that shape successful producer-supplier relationships 


-  ,  Paradoxically ,  the realization that all enterprises are part of complex ,  evolving systems imparts new meaning to relationships and trust 


-  As Webber has said ,  The New Economy starts with technology and ends with trust 


-  That leads to the question: Can partners in complex supply networks co-innovate more-sustainable practices? ,  For example ,  Nike has programs in place with six of its material suppliers to collect 100% of their scrap and recycle it into the next round of products 


-  Similarly ,  all the big steps in design for remanufacture require intense cooperation up and down supply chains 


-  If you don't have suppliers hooked in ,  the whole thing will fail ,  says former Lakes chief engineer John Elter 


-  The Xerox team hosted supplier symposiums where we taught suppliers what remanufacturing means and gave them the basic tools for remanufacture ,  says Elter 


-  Even more important ,  they assured suppliers that they would share in the cost savings  because used parts would go back to the suppliers for remanufacture 


-  The key is that suppliers participate in the economic benefit of remanufacturing because they don't have to make everything new 


-  Without doubt ,  one of the biggest challenges with our Evergreen Service Contract [Interface's model for selling floor-covering services rather than carpeting] ,  says chairman Ray Anderson ,  is transforming mental models built up over generations  such as those of purchasing departments in big companies whose incentives are based purely on cost of purchase ,  rather than on lifetime costs and aesthetic benefits 


-  That is why the shift from seeing  world of suppliers and customers to one in which we are all part of larger systems is essential 


-  ,  From Closed Doors to Transparency The world in which key corporate decisions could be made behind closed doors is disappearing 


-  Despite the fact that the company had gone through  three-year process to identify the best environmental option and had the concurrence of the  


-  Shell had failed to realize that its private decision had become  public one ,   harsh lesson learned by many other companies ,  from Nike to Ford to Microsoft ,  in recent years 


-   The old world of corporate inner sanctums isolated managers from many of their decisions' social and environmental consequences ,  distant in time and space from those who made the decisions 


-  In this sense ,  transparency is  powerful ally to naturalism and may drive many of the changes needed to implement more-naturalistic ,  circular business processes and models 


-  Several years ago ,  Greenpeace objected to the chlorides IKEA used in the printing of catalogs 


-  But working together ,  Greenpeace and IKEA found  Finnish printing company that could produce catalogs without chlorides 


-  IKEA presented its chloride-free catalog at an environmental conference in Washington and set  new industry standard 


-  Shell and others are moving toward triple-bottom-line accounting  assessing economic ,  environmental and social performance in  balanced way 


-  But companies like Shell ,  Ford and many others feel they must do this if they want to lead ,  rather than just react to change 


-  The New York Times ignored most of the report  ( which included lengthy sections on reducing emissions and radical redesign of manufacturing processes )  to announce that Ford Is Conceding SUV Drawbacks 


- 23 The article focused on  three-page section of the 98-page report that discussed the dilemma of having  profitable product line that had environmental and safety problems 


-  The Wall Street Journal was more personal ,  suggesting that chairman William Clay Ford was  hypocrite for both making and criticizing SUVs ,   guilt-ridden rich kid who should either embrace his customers' preferences or leave the business to those who do 


-  Perhaps new collaborative action-research networks will create the right climate of objectivity and compassion ,  tough standards and fair reporting combined with  spirit of learning together 


-  )  Perhaps more-participative media ,  building on successful experiments such as those of Fast Company ,  will enable new levels of collaborative innovation 


-  Today's world of abundant financial capital and limited natural and social capital differs profoundly from the world of  century ago ,  when there was  need to protect individual investors 


-  In  world where learning and knowledge generation are the basis for corporate survival and wealth creation ,  managers must see  company as  living being ,   human community ,  says writer and former Shell executive Arie de Geus 


-  Yet ,  today's managers inherit  very different worldview ,  focused on the optimism of financial capital 


-  Is it not inconsistent to emphasize knowledge creation ,  on the one hand ,  and then treat  company as  machine for producing money ,  which is owned by its financial investors on the other? ,  Perhaps when we are able to rediscover company  ( from the Latin com-panis ,  sharing of bread )  as living community ,  we will also rediscover its place within the larger community of living systems where it rightfully resides 


-  ,  Creative engineers understand the role of constraints ,  says Elter of his Lakes experience 


-  The artist understands that rather than just being limits ,  constraints can be freeing ,  especially when those constraints that have genuine meaning are recognized 


-  What if product and business designers everywhere recognized that their constraints came from living systems? What if they adhered to the simple dictums: waste equals food; support nature's regenerative processes; live off energy income ,  not principal; and ,  borrowing from Elter's team ,  do it for the children 


-  It will come from everywhere and nowhere in particular 


- In the early 1990s ,   Fortune 100 company contemplated making  sizable investment to manufacture and distribute  core product in Asia 


-  In making his judgment ,  he overlooked financial ,  operational and strategic information that contradicted his views 


-  Senior executives ,  relying on the companys  


-  After the resulting debacle and much soul searching ,  managers realized that they had let themselves be misled by their untested assumptions 


-  ,  Such problems are not new ,  but in todays world ,  they can be fatal 


-  Rapid advances in information and production technologies have combined with global expansion and competition to create  business environment in which change is the norm 


-  ,  Theres nothing wrong with change 


-  Classic management texts insist change is necessary for business survival and exhort executives to abandon their organizational isolationism  and their naive belief in environmental stability and homogenous ,  conflict-free workplaces 


-  In dynamic internal and external business environments ,  leaders must be able to interpret cues and make decisions 


-  But decision making is increasingly complex and success uncertain 


-  To ager can handle an expatriate assignment ,  for example ,   decision maker might need to use intuitive assessment in addition to analytic tools and research 


-  Not surprisingly ,  increasing numbers of companies invest in programs to help managers improve intuitive judgment 


-  ,  Although intuitive judgment has benefits ,  mounting evidence suggests that it often runs contrary to rational thinking ,  with managers confidence in their judgments and predictions far exceeding objective accuracy rates 


-  Also ,  objectively irrelevant factors may influence choices 


-  For example ,  some research shows that policy decisions based on numbers of jobs saved are often different from decisions based on numbers of jobs lost 


-  Other research demonstrates that members of negotiating teams believe they have more-powerful bargaining positions than do solo counterparts ,  even when the only difference is the number of negotiators at the bargaining table 


-  Most important ,  people who are unaware of the problems with intuitive judgment fail to compensate for it in their decision making 


-  Our analysis and field research have highlighted how projection has affected industries as diverse as consumer products ,  petroleum ,  manufacturing and professional services 


-  ,  The Fortune 100 manufacturing company that blundered in  promising Asian market illustrates projections insidious effects 


-  Despite detailed analysis ,  the go/no-go decision was not clear-cut 


-  Attractive financing was available; however ,  market data looked only marginally favorable ,  and political and cultural factors were unknowns 


-  If anything ,  the bulk of the evidence suggested aborting the initiative 


-  He was sure that others really shared his beliefs and were merely being cautious 


-  Political and labor problems doubled the time required for construction of the manufacturing facilities 


-  Inadequate infrastructure and external parties unwillingness to fulfill agreements thwarted distribution 


-  North American control systems created friction with employees ,  and Asian consumers did not take to the product as readily as anticipated 


-  ,  In subsequent candid discussions ,  the project champion revealed that he knew the business case had been weak 


-  He had made an intuitive judgment and assumed that his own beliefs ,  values and experiences were shared by others  projection at work 


-  The members of the planning and investment committees also projected their values and experiences onto the Asian business environment 


-  ,  Understanding projection and its impact on decision making can not only explain inconsistencies and irrational choices ,  it can prevent the problems from occurring 


-  Most often ,  we overestimate the proportion of others who share our beliefs 


-  Because of our bias ,  we assume that the beliefs and behavior of others will be like ours 


-  Both those who cheated and those who didnt overestimated the commonness of their particular tendency 


- 10 Recruiters who would say no to requests for polygraph tests or to marital-status disclosures  ( which employers are proscribed from demanding )  expected higher rates of refusal from others 


-   recruiter who would agree to take  polygraph test assumed that most candidates would also  and that  noncompliant candidate had something to hide 


-  ,  What psychological processes underlie the perception that ones own beliefs are common to most people? Researchers have identified five possibilities: surrounding oneself with similar others  ( selective exposure and cognitive availability )  attending to ones own views the most  ( salience of point of view )  believing that ones own behavior is based on the situation and that others behavior is based on their nature  ( causal attributions )  filling in the gaps in ambiguous situations  ( situational construal )  and needing to validate ones own beliefs  ( motivation )  


- 11 Selective exposure refers to peoples tendency to select friends ,  acquaintances ,  colleagues and advisers who share their backgrounds ,  interests ,  values and outlooks 


-  It is not surprising that when consulting similar others ,  people hear their own views and conclude that almost everyone shares those views 


-  Selective exposure creates  bias in their understanding of the variety of views others hold 


- 12 Cognitive availability refers to the mental process by which people bring certain information to mind 


-  Rather than conduct an exhaustive search ,  they search their memories for readily available information ,  which includes their own views and any data that support those views 


-   global consulting organization convened biannually  group of senior executives and valued managers for two days of operational meetings 


-  Because individuals were nominated by their regional offices ,  it was understood that they represented the opinions of  local peer group 


-  They advised the executives on how company policies affected individuals at the senior-consultant and manager levels 


-  As the organizations employee base diversified throughout the 1990s ,   broader array of interests were discussed ,  including day-care facilities ,  nondiscriminatory work practices ,  elder care and general quality-of-life issues 


-  ,  The first time an African-American participated in the group was at  planning session one of the authors facilitated 


-  When it was her turn ,  the new member said ,  somewhat nervously ,  that advancement within the firm was particularly difficult for members of minority groups 


-  ,  In private conversation with the author ,  the senior executive explained why he had handled the diversity issue as he did 


-  He had thought deeply about the issue ,  trying to remember examples of problems in the company 


-  He had consulted with others ,  and they had confirmed what he believed 


-  He further explained that he had talked about the issue with his partners  ( white and male )  ,  with whom he felt comfortable discussing [such]  sensitive topic and that previous conversations with the managers in the room had given him the impression that they ,  like himself ,  were unwilling to discuss it 


-  ,  In projecting his own beliefs onto others ,  the senior executive overlooked  potentially important issue ,  marginalized  promising manager and perhaps decreased the likelihood of hearing from her again 


-  ,  The executive responded that way because of his selective exposure to partners who reinforced his viewpoint and led him to conclude that his beliefs were shared by an even broader population  ( the managers in the room and beyond )  


-  Unlike secondhand information ,  our own knowledge and experiences are rich and vivid 


-  That vividness captures our attention and biases both the information we gather from others and our judgments 


-  Alternative views and options recede 


-  Research shows that when people consider  particular course of action ,  their perception that others would agree with their conclusion increases ,  and their perception of the commonness of differing beliefs diminishes 


-  Stalwarts seven senior executives ,  having completed their annual off-site strategic-planning cycle with one of the authors ,  were preparing for  board meeting 


-  To the author ,  the planning meetings had seemed to run smoothly 


-  He indicated that in the past each individual had negotiated merely for the good of her or his respective department ,  and he was glad he didnt have to meet individually with members to secure support this time 


-  In fact ,  the chief financial officer was shocked ,  pointing to  thick binder of strategic and financial analyses indicating the acquisition was not the right way to proceed 


-  He held steadfastly to that vivid personal vision despite others concerns 


-  ,  The process of understanding and attributing causes of behavior is another driver of projection 


-  Specifically ,  projection is greater when people consider that their own beliefs and behaviors are arising from the situation  ( situational factors )  rather than from their disposition  ( personal factors )  


- 18 Personal factors are stable characteristics of an individual ,  whereas situational factors emphasize the external circumstances in which the individual operates 


-  Attributing their decisions to the realities of  situation ,  executives assume that most others would respond similarly 


-  ,  Although individuals maintain that their own behavior is determined by the situation ,  they usually believe that the behavior of others is based on personality or disposition  ( actor-observer effect )  


-  Thus when two managers disagree ,  each believes the others dogged persistence is attributable to stubbornness but that his or her own persistence is  sensible response that other reasonable managers would likely support 


-  ,  That thought process is particularly prevalent when the same information leads to different recommendations; it frequently emerges in new cross-functional teams focused on product development or organizational redesign 


-  Such temporary teams generally bring together people from diverse functions who are preoccupied with the effect  decision could have on their department 


-  ,  When one person disagrees with  recommended course of action because of its perceived effect on his or her department ,  others often fail to consider that persons situation ,  assuming instead that the dissension springs from  contrary disposition 


-  Believing their view is shared by other team members ,  they become increasingly certain that if the dissenter were rational and working in the organizations best interests ,  he or she would not disagree 


-  They point out that most social situations are ambiguous and lead people to fill in the gaps from whatever personal knowledge they have 


-  The European office of  Brussels-based  


-  multinational corporation and its French supplier spent several days discussing costs ,  product packaging ,  quality standards ,  distribution processes and related issues 


-  The author decided to interview each side separately to understand the precise meaning of special relationship 


-  He detailed the presumed benefits to both companies ,  noting that the French company ultimately would be required to open its books 


-  ,  The French had  different understanding of special relationship 


-  The French team expected to continue with its favorable arrangement  one that enabled it to pursue other partnerships 


-  ,  Each group relied on its own construal of the vague phrase special relationship and projected its own understanding onto the other party 


-  Not surprisingly ,   misunderstanding ensued 


-  When the Brussels team got specific about being exclusive and opening the books ,  it saw the French respond coolly and realized something was awry 


-  Each party viewed the others reactions as surprising and inappropriate; negotiations foundered and mutual trust suffered 


-  However ,  motivational factors ,  such as the desire for social acceptance or the need to maintain self-esteem ,  also play  role in projection and may work independently of the cognitive drivers 


- 21 ,  Research shows that overestimating consensus for their positions helps individuals with minority views bolster their self-esteem 


- 22 Those whose identity is threatened by receiving negative feedback comprise another group that overestimates others support 


- 23 According to the motivational explanation for projection ,  newly arrived executives who are unsure of their standing  and executives whose intuitive ability ,  not their quantitative ability ,  has led to their rise through the ranks will overestimate consensus 


-  ,  Note that in discussing projection ,  we are careful to avoid saying two things 


-  In fact ,  some studies show that when objective information is lacking ,  people who project their own preferences onto others may be more accurate than those who do not 


- 24 In one study ,  respondents making predictions about people who were highly similar to themselves used their own preferences as proxies and were more accurate than were those who did not rely on their personal preferences 


- 25 Note also that when people have no belief about how others might respond ,  they are unlikely to engage in projection 


- 26 In such cases ,  people understand the inappropriateness of using their own responses as proxies for someone elses 


- 27 Not only do people underestimate the commonness of their abilities ,  but their bias about the uniqueness of  particular attribute increases as the attributes importance to them increases 


-  Training that explains the nature of the bias ,  even when combined with decision-making projects immediately followed by feedback ,  is not enough 


- 28 Training may reduce projections effect when  series of repetitive decisions occur in  narrow context ,  but training has not proved highly effective for decisions that are not routine  precisely the type that executives face 


-  Inferential errors are  natural part of being human; it is unwise to assume the susceptibility applies only to others 


-  To create awareness ,  managers must first accept the fact that most people  themselves included  overestimate the commonness of their beliefs 


-  That realization may help managers be more attentive to the diversity of opinion in their companies 


-  Next ,  they must accept the fact that projection is difficult to overcome because it is the result of tacit mental processes 


-  Attenuating biased decision processes takes practice 


-  ,  At company planning sessions ,  the authors have created awareness of decision biases using relatively simple activities for example ,  empirically demonstrating overconfidence and incorrect assumptions about others views 


-  An experiential learning activity ,  such as having people champion an opposing viewpoint ,  has helped individuals realize they are not immune to projection 


-  Combining lectures with experiential demonstration helps create an environment in which executives hold themselves individually and collectively accountable for maintaining an awareness of how the projection of their own beliefs onto others might affect the decisions they make 


-  Getting people to reduce reliance on their own judgments and seek out contrary evidence can improve decision making greatly 


-  That principle applies to individuals decisions as well as groups ,  but given the deep-seated nature of projection and the speed with which it occurs ,  it is helpful to have group members hold one another accountable 


- 29 It attenuates the natural inclination to underestimate the role of situational factors in others behavior 


-  ,   useful exercise involves adopting an adversarys position and assuming it is legitimate 


-  Generating  list of supportive arguments for the adversarys view can help people recognize the bias in their assumptions and the merits of other positions 


-  Once  manager begins to understand the situational arguments in support of anothers viewpoint ,  it is easier to reach consensus on  course of action 


-  ,  Interpersonal conflict often creates discomfort for people; however ,  it can hold the key to overcoming the negative consequences of projection 


-  Executives need to challenge their assumptions and recommendations  and the assumptions and recommendations of others 


-  One easy way is to enhance the diversity of perspectives represented in the companys inner circle and require that members share their perspectives openly and constructively challenge one anothers views 


-  In the United States ,  the process often involves challenging the status quo and envisioning competing choices 


-  Antagonistic discussions erupt among members of different functional units ,  with people clinging to their own perspectives and attacking others 


-  In such cases ,  it is important to avoid attributing others behavior to personality problems and instead to focus on the information the others are using 


-  Team members must take time to analyze their own information as well 


-  In facilitated sessions ,  the authors encourage people to make explicit the knowledge they rely on when drawing conclusions about others 


-  People need to ask themselves ,  What behavior have  really observed? Might  be mistakenly attributing intent because the other person has  different view? ,  Auditing key decisions and the process by which they unfold can help attenuate projection 


-  Decisions in organizations are often made in stages ,  with ambiguous data quickly becoming unquestioned facts 


- 31 To help ensure that key assumptions are grounded in data ,  decision makers should review them carefully 


-  ,  The most effective audit is  facilitated group session that leverages each persons perspective 


-  Although it would be inefficient to analyze every decision ,  major decisions about employment and investments may merit additional investigation 


-  Stepping back and checking the facts  and the process by which the facts were generated  can uncover projection and improve the quality of decision making 


-  In general ,  groups are more likely to uncover important information if they discuss facts rather than opinions 


-  ,  When collective review is not  viable option ,  individuals should reflect on decision processes by themselves 


-  We all selectively encode and access information in memory and can reconstruct and confidently hold memories of events that never occurred 


-  Managers should be aware of memorys fallibility and malleability whenever they reconstruct peoples behavior from memory and use it to attribute intentions to others 


-  Focused questions can help: Am  relying too heavily on data culled from my own memory and experience to the point of blinding myself to other data? Are there other possible interpretations of the situation? Did  entertain multiple outcomes or courses of action? Reflective questions linked to the different theoretical explanations for projection can raise self-awareness and minimize unanticipated outcomes 


-  When making decisions ,  executives often ask ,  What did we do last time? The salience of traditional or standard solutions may stifle consideration of alternatives 


-  To decide what role it should play ,   manager should ask ,  How well did tradition serve us in past decisions? Do the same tenets apply to the current scenario? ,  Also ,  managers should not be seduced by the salience of their own actions to the point that they overlook knowledge from others 


-  Asking questions such as What did competitors do and how did their choices fare? helps ensure that decisions are grounded firmly in information relevant to the current scenario 


-  ,  According to the motivational explanation of projection ,  the reason people want to believe that others share their views is that they crave social acceptance 


-  They also may convince themselves that they possess unique levels of certain abilities  say ,  knowing the best way to manage  software-development project or how to understand other people 


-  Decision makers who realize that confidence in their skill is not widely shared may experience  threat to their self-worth 


-  Disentangling self-worth and estimates of consensus will lead to greater realism in decision making 


- 33 Executives must assimilate information and make decisions in chaotic environments  often without the benefit of sufficient practice ,  planning or research 


-  Understanding projection can help people see why they often perceive others decisions and actions as irrational or misguided 


-  And it can help explain how  smart ,  well-meaning executive could decide to expand into Asia  confident of success  while perpetuating North American perspectives ,  policies and practices 


-  Knowledge about projection also can reveal the causes of failed interpersonal relationships by helping managers develop insight into the workings of their own minds as they try to make sense of others actions
