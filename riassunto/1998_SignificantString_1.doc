-  Out-sourcing arrangements with contract revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars ,  once considered large ,  are dwarfed by recent deals such as those signed by  


-   1996 survey of 450 information systems executives in North America and Europe found that about 50 percent of the respondents were planning to engage in outsourcing during 1996 ,  and another 25 percent were considering it 


-  Why are companies outsourcing the activities of their IS departments at such an unprecedented rate when IT has never been more critical to business success? ,  The motivations for outsourcing are evolving from  primary focus on cost reduction to an emerging emphasis on improving business performance 


-  Morgan ,  with well-run ,  innovative IS departments that are large enough to accrue the same scale and specialization benefits as  vendor ,  are nevertheless engaged in significant outsourcing deals 


-  Furthermore ,  as the growing role and importance of information and communications technologies become widely recognized ,  companies frequently confront  wide disparity between the capabilities and skills necessary to realize the potential of these technologies and the reality of their own in-house technology capabilities and skills 


-  Some firms outsource for strategic ,  not tactical ,  reasons ,  to exploit more fully the business benefits of IT 


-  Dow Chemical realized it was losing IS staff with critical business skills ,  so it created  unique outsourcing joint venture to enhance career opportunities and gain access to  broader talent pool 


-  To make its IS operations more cost effective and leverage its back-office processing expertise in issuing policies and processing claims ,  CNA Insurance established  new life-insurance business processing service with its out-sourcing partner as  part of  huge long-term data-center outsourcing deal 


-  In another unusual deal ,  Swiss Bank Corporation acquired  stake in its vendor ,  with the intention of offering outsourcing services to other financial services companies 


-  The third category of intent ,  commercial exploitation ,  focuses on leveraging technology-related assets  applications ,  operations ,  infrastructure ,  and know-how  in the marketplace through the development and marketing of new technology-based products and services 


-  Our research suggests that these poor outcomes are often due to failure to define clearly the intent and specific goals for out-sourcing ,  to align the contract and relationship with strategic objectives ,  to make contracts flexible enough to adjust to changes in the business or technology ,  and to ensure that the vendor has the capabilities required to meet the objectives for outsourcing 


-  Where ambitions for outsourcing encompass multiple objectives ,  the contracts and management mechanisms must be even more sophisticated to address the additional complexity 


-  One IT executive we interviewed pointed out just how dramatically the goals of outsourcing can change: Initially our objectives for outsourcing were to do better those things that we were already doing ,  as well as to bring in new skills ,  tools ,  and competencies 


-  As our business changed ,  our objectives for outsourcing expanded to delivering bottom-line business benefits from IT in  way that was not done before 


-  In discussing each ,  we focus on the elements of the outsourcing relationship that organization scientists have identified as critical to the success of contractual relationships: the contract type ,  the performance measurement and evaluation scheme ,  the compensation system ,  and the assignment of decision-making rights to the vendor 


-  Senior managers must understand that for each kind of strategic intent ,  the nature of both the risks and rewards are different ,  and therefore the control mechanisms must be different 


-  The challenge is to design the contract and relationship so that the selected options contribute to the client companys objectives: IS cost reduction and service improvement ,  improved business performance ,  or the creation of commercial ventures 


-  ,  The company procuring IT outsourcing services must understand the economics of the production process for information services: the cost structure for the delivery of information services ,  and how this structure is affected by the risks to each party 


-  The company must know how the vendor intends to achieve the desired objectives and be sure to provide appropriate incentives such as asset transfer and performance-related payments 


-  Their objectives typically include cost reduction ,  service quality improvement ,  and acquisition of new technical skills and management competencies 


-  The structure of the deals ,  however ,  has changed considerably as technology requirements have changed and as companies have learned from experience 


-  Contracts contained neither formal incentives nor penalty clauses ,  but the understanding that ,  if suppliers performed well ,  Kodak would make more use of their resources  ( thus increasing their revenue and profit )  was implicit in the relationships 


-  The primary motivation was the desire to implement consistent standards ,  technologies ,  processes ,  and management systems across the company worldwide 


-  Thus Guinness found it desirable to work with  single vendor with the skills ,  scope ,  and leverage to implement global policies 


-  More recently ,  Swiss Bank and Guinness forged flexible partnerships with out-sourcing service providers in order to accomplish similar objectives 


-  We also believe that transferring ownership and responsibility for IT assets  particularly people and technology  from the customer to the out-sourcing vendor is critical to success 


-  Realizing this goal requires an understanding of the business and the link between IT and business processes ,  and the ability to implement new systems and business change simultaneously 


-  In several instances of out-sourcing for business impact ,  we found that the most effective approach focused on jointly developing complementary skills and capabilities ,  rather than simply relying on those of the vendor 


-  These goals might include the capabilities to deliver innovative information systems  ( for example ,  automating order fulfillment ,  inventory management ,  or customer management processes )  and the competencies related to business process analysis and management  ( for example ,  using technology to reengineer business processes )  


-  Outsourcing can free up financial resources and management attention ,  support the operation and maintenance of existing systems until they can be replaced ,  provide career paths for staff with legacy skills ,  and supply technical and business know-how to augment new initiatives 


-  The company out-sourced most of the existing infrastructure and 70 percent of its IS staff people to EDS  thereby giving them an opportunity to develop new career paths 


-  The contract addressed the companys cost and service objectives ,  but more importantly ,  it made liquid  significant portion of the IT asset base to provide seed money for the new IT infrastructure and for process and systems reengineering 


-  The main impediment was its aged and inflexible customer-billing system  ( which is the heart of all operations and feeds into all its other information systems )  ,  but the IS group lacked the skills and competencies necessary to replace the old system and manage the new one 


-  The applications development manager at Dow saw that outsourcing offered  way both to build competence in those areas where he wanted his group to excel and to off-load responsibility for everything else to an experienced partner 


-  Typically ,  Dow takes sole responsibility for managing the relationship with the business ,  architecture ,  and running IS applications in the business units ,  areas in which it had proven competency 


-  Both share the responsibility for systems implementation and productivity 


-  ,  Some companies that outsource IT for business impact ask their outsourcing partner not only to implement new systems with bottom-line impact ,  but to take on further responsibility for implementing changes in the business as well 


-  Rolls Royce Aerospace Groups deal with EDS combines consulting with systems integration and outsourcing to cover  range of business transformation initiatives including time to market ,  customer service ,  supply chain management ,  and manufacturing and engineering operations 


-  CoreStates Bank and Andersen Consulting have formed an outsourcing alliance to enhance CoreStates revenues by facilitating new product development ,  to improve the speed and efficiency of bringing new products to market and increase customer service quality ,  and to use Andersen Consultings expertise to give CoreStates access to new capabilities and technologies 


-  ,  Our research identifies business impact as  significant and growing objective for IT outsourcing ,  and one that is driving  fundamental change in the nature of the relationship between the user and the provider of IT outsourcing services 


-  For example ,  companies wanting cost-effective IT-enabled business solutions that require an understanding of their business should enter into arrangements that give the vendor incentives to learn about the customers business while still maintaining competitive pressures on the vendor 


-  ,  Success factors are more business oriented than technical  for example ,  understanding the operation ,  fitting IT to business needs ,  being able to manage change projects ,  and having the right balance of management expertise and technical know-how 


-  The means by which IT assets can be leveraged commercially range from licensing systems and technologies developed initially for internal use ,  through selling IS products and services to other firms ,  to launching new IT-based businesses 


-  ,  Many companies also find it increasingly difficult to acquire ,  develop ,  and retain the people and technical know-how necessary to maintain existing complex systems and implement new ones 


-  Furthermore ,  few IS organizations have the capabilities required to exploit IT in the marketplace: the know-how to commercialize and sell IT products and services originally developed for use by  single company ,  the ability to establish new distribution channels for IT-based products and services ,  the skill to port systems to various technology platforms ,  and the wherewithal to support and enhance products and services after they are sold 


-  ,  We expect to see an increase in outsourcing deals with the intent of commercial exploitation 


-  For their part ,  the outsourcing vendors look to client firms as unique sources of the industry-specific expertise ,  know-how ,  and technology assets that are essential to developing new and innovative systems in complex and competitive industries 


-  More ambitious objectives involve attempts to restructure industries by building new electronic market processes or distribution channels  ( such as Web-based travel reservation systems and on-line trading )  and creating entirely new IT businesses  ( typically ,  applications software ,  IT consulting ,  and business process outsourcing )  


-  ,  All companies considering IT outsourcing  whether their strategic intent is commercial exploitation or not  should be aware that the vendor with which they contract may seek ways to commercially leverage the assets  ( people ,  systems ,  and technology )  it acquires by using them to service other accounts or by selling or providing other firms access to them 


-  Companies should therefore realistically assess the potential commercial value of outsourced IT assets and understand how the vendor intends to use them 


-  This should be factored into the contractual terms of the relationship  for example ,  by increasing the amount paid by the outsourcing vendor for the assets it receives in the deal ,  by discounting the price for services ,  or by setting up  revenue-sharing arrangement 


-  SBC went into IT out-sourcing with Perot Systems to speed its IT infrastructure transformation and to explicitly leverage in the marketplace its already-substantial investment in IT expertise and infrastructure 


-  The two parties signed  twenty-five-year contract worth an estimated US $208 million per year; 700 IT specialists were transferred to  new division created by the vendor to provide state-of-the-art systems and network services to SBC and to other customers in the global financial services industry 


-  Under the agreement ,  Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation  ( ISSC )  took responsibility for managing most of the utilitys IT infrastructure ,  including its data center ,  workstations ,  computer help desk ,  and intrastate microwave network 


-  At the same time ,  ISSC and  new PSC subsidiary ,   Prime ,  will develop IT-based applications to support its new customer-service energy management business 


-  The venture combines CSCs IT management expertise and object-oriented applications software with CNA Insurances business process know-how 


-  The deal gave Philips an initial 15 percent equity share of BSO-Origin and two seats on the management board 


-  The communications services and data center people moved to  new wholly owned subsidiary called Communications and Processing Services  ( Philips C&PS )  that was set up as  profit-and-loss center and encouraged to sell its IS services externally 


-  Recently ,  Philips C&PS and BSO-Origin have cooperated to deliver services jointly to external customers 


-  For these deals to succeed ,  they must contain adequate incentives for each party to share costs and risks over the course of the relationship 


-  The chief impediments to success include misjudging or failing to realize synergies of assets and capabilities ,  failing to fulfill commitments to internal customers ,  and perhaps most critical ,  ensuring that the rewards received by the partners are commensurate with the risks that each assumes 


-  These ventures simply do not work unless each party makes  significant investment of management and staff ,  technology resources ,  and funding 


-  ,  An important pricing provision relates to the charges for services provided to the primary internal customer and ,  in particular ,  whether they should be provided at cost or cost plus profit 


-  ,  IT commercial exploitation can be  viable way to generate revenue ,  raise capital ,  recover costs ,  recruit and retain scarce talent ,  and develop and broadly leverage capabilities 


-  ,  The findings of our research strongly establish the importance of understanding the different types of strategic intent for IT  IS improvement ,  business impact ,  and commercial exploitation  and the role that outsourcing can play in pursuing each 


-  In this article ,  we have argued that there is no one size fits all approach to IT outsourcing  each type of strategic intent for IT outsourcing requires different approaches and tactics to be realized successfully 


-  ,  It is not sufficient simply to accept vendor claims of capabilities ,  even if the company is prepared to make  contractual commitment 


-  Business impact requires change management competence and reengineering skills as well as process know-how 


-  Commercial exploitation demands sales and marketing prowess ,  an established customer base ,  and viable channels of distribution 


-  Key competencies include IT performance measurement ,  IT services market tracking ,  project management ,  and deal making ,  negotiation ,  and conflict resolution 


-  ,  Out-sourcing vendors must be chosen with care ,  paying particular attention to shared objectives and cultural fit 


-  Both parties must develop  mutual understanding of their work processes and identify critical aspects of the relationship 


-  It is important therefore to anticipate shifts in these priorities and to build flexibility into contracts and alliances to deal with them 


-  The contract must be resilient enough to deal with future changes in requirements 


-  ,  While ambitious business and technical objectives for information technology are always difficult to achieve ,  we believe that the chances of success are greatly increased when strategic intent is well understood and the relationship is managed to address these critical issues
