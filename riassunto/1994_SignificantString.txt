-  ( Wall Street says they do deals 


-  Yet ,  for the better part of this century ,  the classical writers  Henri Fayol and Lyndell Urwick ,  among others  kept telling us that good managers are essentially controllers 


-  ,  It is  curiosity of the management literature that its best-known writers all seem to emphasize one particular part of the managers job to the exclusion of the others 


-  Together ,  perhaps ,  they cover all the parts ,  but even that does not describe the whole job of managing 


-  ,  If you turn to the more formalized literature ,  you will find all kinds of lists  of tasks or roles or competences 


-  But  list is not  model  ( even if presented in the form of  circle ,  meaning the ends have been joined )  ,  and so the integrated work of managing still gets lost in the process of describing it 


-  And without such  model ,  we can neither understand the job properly nor deal with its many important needs  for design ,  selection ,  training ,  and support 


-  ,  To play with  metaphor ,  if the toughest nut to crack in our knowledge of management has been the managers job itself ,  then that may well be because we have done just that 


-  We have been so intent on breaking the job into pieces that we never came to grips with the whole thing 


-  It is time ,  therefore ,  to consider the integrated job of managing 


-  ,  That is what  set out to do several years ago ,  after becoming discouraged with all those lists and circles  ( including one from my own initial study of managerial work ,  first published in 1973 )  


-   did not feel the need to go find out what managers do 


-  We knew that already ,   believed ,  based on  considerable body of research and publication over the past decades 


-  Our need was for  framework to put all this together ,   model of managing ,  if you like 


-  People had to be able to see the job in one place ,  in order to deal with its component parts comprehensively and interactively 


-  In fact ,  as my ideas developed ,  the metaphor of the nut came alive ,  for the model has taken the form of an interacting set of concentric circles 


-  ,  Using this model ,   began to spend time with managers at work ,  both to check out and to flesh out the model ,  especially as it applies to different managerial jobs and styles 


-   have been spending  day with each of  number of managers  observation reinforced by interviewing  not to draw any definitive conclusions so much as to get  flavor for as wide  variety of managerial jobs and styles as possible 


-  So far they number twenty-three ,  ranging from the head of one of Europes largest state health care systems to the front country manager of  Canadian mountain park 


-  ( Examples used throughout this paper will give  sense of the variety of managers  have studied so far 


-  )  ,  This article presents the model ,  building the image of the managers job from the inside out ,  beginning at the center with the person and his or her frame and working out from there ,  layer by layer 


-  Once this description is complete ,   shall discuss briefly the jobs and styles of some of the managers  have observed to give  sense of how readers might use the model to better appreciate their own jobs or those of the managers around them 


-   shall also comment on the effective practice of managerial work ,  concluding ,  as you may have already guessed ,  that this is one job that has to be well rounded! ,  We begin at the center ,  with the person who comes to the job 


-  People are not neutral when they take on  new managerial job ,  mere putty to be molded into the required shape 


-  Indeed ,  greater appreciation of this fact would allow us to be more careful in how we select managers in the first place 


-  Or else more flexible in how we let them mold their jobs to themselves in the second 


-  ,  Figure  shows that an individual comes to  managerial job with  set of values ,  by this stage in life probably rather firmly set  for example ,  that the radio station he manages should provide intelligent fare 


-  He or she also brings  body of experience that ,  on one hand ,  has forged  set of skills or competences ,  perhaps honed by training ,  and ,  on the other ,  has provided  base of knowledge  that comes ,  for example ,  from spending thirty-five years on  major police force before becoming its commissioner 


-  That knowledge is ,  of course ,  used directly ,  but it is also converted into  set of mental models ,  key means by which managers interpret the world around them  for example ,  how the head nurse on  hospital ward perceives the behavior of the surgeons with whom she must work 


-  Together ,  all these characteristics greatly determine how any manager approaches  given job  his or her style of managing 


-  Style will come to life as we begin to see how  manager carries out what his or her job requires 


-  ,  Embed the person depicted in  given managerial job and you get managerial work 


-  At the core of it is some kind of frame for the job ,  the mental set the incumbent assumes to carry it out 


-  We can show it as three increasingly specific components ,  emanating from the person concentrically in Figure  


-  ,  First is purpose ,  namely what the manager is seeking to do fundamentally with the unit he or she is supposed to manage  for example ,  to increase the state funding for  hospital or to open more stores in  retail chain 


-  To use  metaphor ,   manager may build the track in the first place ,  keep the unit on track  ( or put it back on track )  ,  improve or shift the track ,  or else rebuild the track 


-  The head nurse seeks to keep her unit running smoothly; the chief executive of the state health care system accepts  government mandate for major restructuring 


-  Perspective is the overall approach to the management of the unit ,  including such notions as vision and culture 


-  These positions consider specific locations for the unit in its environment ,  and specific ways of doing its work ,  such as the products produced ,  the markets served ,  the structures and systems designed ,  the facilities provided 


-  ,  Alain Nol ,  who studied the relationship between the frames and the work of the chief executives of three small companies ,  has said that managers have occupations and they have preoccupations 


-  But frame does give rise to  first role in this model as well ,  which  call conceiving ,  namely thinking through the purpose ,  perspective ,  and positions of  particular unit to be managed over  particular period of time 


-  First ,  the frame can be imposed by some outside person or force ,  or else it can be developed by the manager him- or herself 


-  And second ,  that frame may range from being rather sharp to rather vague ,  for example ,  from cutting costs by 10 percent before year end to getting this place in order 


-  The frame of any managerial job ,  as suggested by its placement in the center of the rounding model ,  is  kind of magnet for the behaviors that surround it 


-  That is presumably why there has been so much demand in recent years for clearer vision in strategic thinking 


-   frame that is self-selected but vague allows the manager wide latitude to maneuver but offers little real sense of direction 


-  Managerial style is likely to become opportunistic ,  as in the case of  health care manager who uses any possible means to bring his unit under control 


-  But having  vague frame imposed on the manager  ( such as empower your people )  may provide little real help and risks evoking  passive style of management  ( unless ,  of course ,  the manager sharpens it )  


-   sharp frame that the manager selects would tend to lead to  determined ,  sometimes visionary ,  style of management 


-  For example ,  the head of  fashion museum sees her role as the preservation of  national heritage 


-   sharp frame that is ,  in contrast ,  imposed ,  could well lead to  driven style of management ,  as in the example of that chief executive of the state medical system who tries to honor the governments intentions 


-  ,  Given  person in  particular managerial job with  particular frame ,  the question arises of how this is manifested in the form of specific activities 


-  That happens through the agenda to carry out the work ,  and the associated role of scheduling ,  which has received considerable attention in the literature of management ,  for example ,  in the empirical work of John Kotter 


-  Agenda is considered in two respects here ,  again shown as concentric circles  ( in Figure  )  ,  the inner one more general ,  the outer one more specific 


-  Ask any manager about his or her work ,  and the almost inevitable first reply will be about the issues of central concern ,  those things on the plate ,  as the saying goes  promoting public exhibitions at the museum and developing  state-of-the-art storage facility for its clothing ,  for example 


-  Or take  look at the agendas of meetings and you will likewise see  list of issues  ( rather than decisions )  


-  Sometimes  frame can be so sharp ,  and the issues therefore so tightly integrated ,  that they all reduce to what Nol has called one magnificent obsession 


-  In effect ,  all the concerns of the manager revolve around one central issue ,  for example ,  imposing those changes on the state health care system or expanding that retail chain 


-  ,  Second ,  the frame and the issues get manifested in the more tangible schedule ,  the specific allocations of managerial time on  day-by-day basis 


-  The scheduling of time and the prioritization of issues are obviously of great concern to all managers ,  and ,  in fact ,  are themselves significant consumers of managerial time 


-  Accordingly ,   great deal of attention has been devoted to these concerns ,  including numerous courses on time management 


-  ,  If we label the person in the job with  frame manifested by an agenda  (  


-  ,  all the circles so far discussed )  ,  the central core of the managers job ,  then we turn next to the context in which this core is embedded ,  the milieu in which the work is practiced 


-  ,  The context of the job is depicted in Figure  by the lines that surround the core 


-   manager ,  by definition ,  has formal authority over an organizational unit ,  whether that be  whole organization in the case of  chief executive or  division ,  department ,  or branch ,  and so on ,  in the case of  manager within the hierarchy 


-  ,  Inside refers to the unit being managed ,  shown below the manager to represent his or her formal authority over its people and activities  the hospital ward in the case of the head nurse ,  for example 


-  Within ,  shown to the right ,  refers to the rest of the organization ,  other members and other units with which the manager must work but over which he or she has no formal authority  the doctors ,  the kitchen ,  the physiotherapists in the rest of the hospital ,  to continue with the same example 


-  ( Of course ,  in the case of chief executive ,  there is no inside separate from within: that person has authority over the entire organization 


-  )  And outside refers to the rest of the context not formally part of the organization with which the manager must work  in this example ,  patients relatives ,  long-term care institutions to which some of the units patients are discharged ,  nursing associations ,  and so on 


-  The importance of this distinction  ( for convenience ,  we shall mostly refer to inside versus outside )  is that much of managerial work is clearly directed either to the unit itself ,  for which the manager has official responsibility ,  or at its various boundary contexts ,  through which the manager must act without that responsibility 


-  ,  We are now ready to address the actual behaviors that managers engage in to do their jobs 


-  In other words ,  we turn now from the largely cerebral roles of conceiving and scheduling at the core to the more tangible roles of getting things done 


-  The essence of the model ,  designed to enable us to see managerial work comprehensively ,  is that these roles are carried out on three successive levels ,  each inside and outside the unit 


-  ,  From the outside  ( or most tangible level )  in ,  managers can manage action directly ,  they can manage people to encourage them to take the necessary actions ,  and they can manage information to influence the people in turn to take their necessary actions 


-  In other words ,  the ultimate objective of managerial work ,  and of the functioning of any organizational unit ,  the taking of action ,  can be managed directly ,  indirectly through people ,  or even more indirectly by information through people 


-  The manager can thus choose to intervene at any of the three levels ,  but once done ,  he or she must work through the remaining ones 


-  Later we shall see that the level  given manager favors becomes an important determinant of his or her managerial style ,  especially distinguishing so-called doers who prefer direct action ,  leaders who prefer working through people ,  and administrators who prefer to work by information 


-  We shall begin with the innermost circle ,  of information ,  containing the most conceptual roles ,  and work out to the more tangible or specific ones 


-  ,  In presenting these roles ,  it should be emphasized that all managers perform all of them as the essence of their work 


-  This model of roles on levels directed inside and outside the unit thus provides the basis for understanding different styles of managing as well as different contexts in which that managing takes place 


-  ,  To manage by information is to sit two steps removed from the purpose of managerial work 


-  The manager processes information to drive other people who ,  in turn ,  are supposed to ensure that necessary actions are taken 


-  In other words ,  here the managers own activities focus neither on people nor on actions per se ,  but rather on information as an indirect way to make things happen 


-  Ironically ,  while this was the classic perception of managerial work for the first half of this century  ( as  discuss later )  ,  in recent years ,  it has also become  newly popular ,  in some quarters almost obsessional ,  view ,  epitomized by the so-called bottom line approach to management 


-  In Figure  ,  communicating is shown by double arrows to indicate that managers devote  great deal of effort to the two-way flow of information with the people all around them  employees inside their own units ,  others in the rest of the organization ,  and especially ,  as the empirical evidence makes abundantly clear ,   great number of outsiders with whom they maintain regular contact 


-  Thus the head of one regional division of the national police force spent  good part of his day passing information back and forth between the central headquarters and the people on his staff 


-  ,  Managers scan their environments ,  they monitor their own units ,  and they share with and disseminate to others considerable amounts of the information they pick up 


-   point worth emphasizing ,  and one emphasized in almost every serious study of managerial work ,  is that the formal information  in other words ,  information capable of being processed in  computer  does not play  particularly dominant role here 


-  Oral information  much of it too early or too soft to formalize ,  such as gossip and hearsay  and even nonverbal information ,  namely what is seen and felt but not heard ,  forms  critical part of every serious managerial job  ( or ,  at least ,  every managerial job performed seriously )  


-  ,  In my initial study ,   described managers as nerve centers of their units ,  who use their status of office to gain access to  wide variety of informational sources 


-  But ,  because the manager is connected to all those specialists ,  he or she should have the broadest base of knowledge about the unit in general 


-  This should apply to the head of an 800 , 000-person health care system ,  with regard to broad policy issues ,  no less than to the clinical director of one of its hospital units ,  with regard to the service rendered there 


-  And so they tend to be exposed to powerful sources of external information and thus emerge as external nerve centers as well 


-  The health care chief executive can thus talk to people running health care systems in other countries and so gain access to an array of information perhaps inaccessible even to his most influential reports 


-  Accordingly ,  to function effectively with the people around them ,  managers have to spend considerable time sharing their information ,  both with outsiders  ( in  kind of spokesperson role )  and with insiders  ( in  kind of disseminator role )  


-  ,   found in my initial study of chief executives that perhaps 40 percent of their time was devoted almost exclusively to the communicating role  just to gaining and sharing information  leaving aside the information processing aspects of all the other roles 


-  In other words ,  the job of managing is fundamentally one of processing information ,  notably by talking and especially listening 


-  Thus Figure  shows the inner core  ( the person in the job ,  conceiving and scheduling )  connected to the outer rings  ( the more tangible roles of managing people and action )  through what can be called the membrane of information processing all around the job 


-  ,  What can be called the controlling role describes the managers efforts ,  not just to gain and share information ,  but to use it in  directive way inside their units: to evoke or provoke general action by the people who report to them 


-  They do this in three broad ways: they develop systems ,  they design structures ,  and they impose directives 


-  Each of these seeks to control how other people work ,  especially with regard to the allocation of resources ,  and so what actions they are inclined to take 


-  ,  First ,  developing systems is the most general of these three ,  and the closest to conceiving 


-  It uses information to control peoples behaviors 


-  Managers often take charge of establishing and even running such systems in their units ,  including those of planning and performance control  ( such as budgeting )  


-  The head nurse ,  for example ,  dispensed with one of the hospitals key control systems and instead developed her own 


-  Robert Simons has noted how chief executives tend to select one such system and make it key to their exercise of control ,  in  manner he calls interactive 


-  Thus ,   day spent with the head of an international environmental organization involved considerable attention to reorganization 


-  ,  Third is imposing directives ,  which is the most direct of the three ,  closest to the people and action ,  although still informational in nature 


-  Managers pronounce: they make specific choices and give specific orders ,  usually in the process of delegating particular responsibilities and authorizing particular requests 


-  In effect ,  managers manage by transmitting information to people so that they can act 


-  Thus  deputy minister in the Canadian government met with  number of his policy analysis people to provide rather specific comments about his wishes on drafts of reports they had submitted to him 


-  ,  If  full decision-making process can be considered in the three stages of diagnosing ,  designing ,  and deciding  in other words ,  identifying issues ,  working out possible solutions ,  and selecting one8  then here we are dealing with  restricted view of decision making 


-  Either way ,  the richest part of the process ,  the stage of designing possible solutions ,  resides with the person being controlled rather than with the manager him- or herself ,  whose own behavior remains rather passive 


-  The single-headed arrows represent the imposed directives ,  while the pitchfork shape symbolizes both the design of structure and the development of systems 


-  The proximity of the controlling role in Figure  to the managers agenda reflects the fact that informational control is the most direct way to operationalize the agenda ,  for example ,  by using budgets to impose priorities or delegation to assign responsibilities 


-  ,  The controlling role is ,  of course ,  what people have in mind when they refer to the administrative aspect of managerial work 


-  In the 1930s ,  for example ,  Gulick and Urwick popularized the acronym POSDCORB  ( planning ,  organizing ,  staffing ,  directing ,  coordinating ,  reporting ,  and budgeting )  


-  Planning ,  organizing ,  directing ,  and budgeting are all clearly focused here ,  while reporting ,  coordinating ,  and staffing have important ,  although not exclusive ,  controlling aspects  ( staffing in the sense of deciding )  


-  Thus it must be concluded that the long-popular description of managerial work was not so much wrong as narrow ,  focusing almost exclusively on one restricted aspect of the job: informational control of the unit through the exercise of formal authority 


-  ,  To manage through people ,  instead of by information ,  is to move one step closer to action ,  but still to remain removed from it 


-  Other people become the means to get things done ,  not the manager him- or herself ,  or even the substance of the managers thoughts 


-  ,  After several decades of POSDCORB thinking and Taylorist technique ,  the Hawthorne experiments of the 1930s demonstrated with dramatic impact that management has to do with more than just the passive informational control of subordinates 


-  Influencing began to replace informing ,  and commitment began to vie with calculation for the attention of the manager 


-  Indeed ,  in the 1960s and 1970s especially ,  the management of people ,  quite independent of content  of the strategies to be realized ,  the information to be processed ,  even the actions to be taken  became  virtual obsession of the literature ,  whether by the label of human relations ,  Theory  ,  or participative management  ( and later quality of work life ,  to be replaced by total quality management )  


-  ,  For  long time ,  however ,  these people remained subordinates in more ways than one 


-  Participation kept them subordinate ,  for this was always considered to be granted at the behest of the managers still fully in control  ( compared with the more constitutional involvement of certain professionals ,  such as doctors in hospitals ,  or even of certain European workers who ,  under co-determination ,  gained legal representation on boards of directors )  


-  Not until serious research on managerial work began did it become evident how important to managers were contacts with individuals outside their units  ( who ,  for example ,  go entirely without mention in POSDCORB! )  


-  Virtually every single study of how all kinds of managers spent their time has indicated that outsiders ,  of an enormously wide variety ,  generally take as much of managers attention as so-called subordinates 


-  We shall thus describe two people roles here ,  shown in Figure  ,  one internal ,  called leading ,  and one external ,  called linking 


-  ,  The leading role has probably received more attention in the literature of management than all the other roles combined 


-  And so we need not dwell on it here 


-  But neither can we ignore it: managers certainly do much more than lead the people in their own units ,  and leading certainly infuses much else of what managers do  ( as ,  in fact ,  do all the roles ,  as we have already noted about communicating )  


-  But their work just as certainly cannot be understood without this dimension 


-  They encourage and drive the people of their units  motivate them ,  inspire them ,  coach them ,  nurture them ,  push them ,  mentor them ,  and so on 


-  All managers ,  from the chief executive of the major police force to the front-country manager in the mountain park ,  stop to chat with their people informally during the day to encourage them in their work 


-  Second ,  managers lead on the group level ,  especially by building and managing teams ,  an effort that has received considerable attention in recent years 


-  Again ,  team meetings ,  including team building ,  figured in many of my observations ,  for example ,  the head of  London film company who brought film-making teams together for both effective and affective purposes 


-  And third ,  they lead on the unit level ,  especially with regard to the creation and maintenance of culture ,  another subject of increasing attention in recent years  ( thanks especially to the Japanese )  


-  Managers ,  for example ,  engage in many acts of  symbolic nature  ( figurehead duties )  to sustain culture ,  as when the head of the national police force visited its officer training institute  ( as he does frequently )  to imbue the forces norms and attitudes in its graduating class 


-  ,  All managers seem to spend time on all three levels of leadership ,  although ,  again ,  styles do vary according to context and personality 


-  If the communicating role describes the manager as the nerve center of the unit ,  then the leading role must characterize him or her as its energy center ,   concept perhaps best captured in Maeterlincks wonderful description of the spirit of the hive 


- 12 Given the right managerial chemistry  ( in the case of Maeterlincks queen bee ,  quite literally! )  ,  it may be the managers mere presence that somehow draws things together 


-  By exuding that mystical substance ,  the leader unites his or her people ,  galvanizing them into action to accomplish the units mission and adapt it to  changing world 


-  For ,  as already noted ,  in their sheer allocation of time ,  managers have been shown to be external linkers as much as they are internal leaders 


- 13 Yet ,  still the point seems hardly appreciated 


-  Indeed ,  now more than ever ,  it must be understood ,  given the great growth of joint ventures and other collaborating and networking relationships between organizations ,  as well as the gradual reconception of the captive employee as an autonomous agent who supplies labor 


-  In the middle are two parallel lines to represent the buffering aspect of this role  that managers must regulate the receipt of external influence to protect their units 


-  Or ,  to add  metaphor ,  the manager acts as  kind of valve between the unit and its environment 


-  Nowhere was this clearer than in my observation of three levels of management in  national park system   regional director ,  the head of one mountain park ,  and the front-country manager of that park 


-  It is  delicate balancing ,  or buffering ,  act indeed! ,  All managers ,  as emphasized in other research and my studies cited earlier ,  appear to spend  great deal of time networking  building vast arrays of contacts and intricate coalitions of supporters beyond their own units ,  whether within the rest of the organization or outside ,  in the world at large 


-  To all these contacts ,  the manager represents the unit externally ,  promotes its needs ,  and lobbies for its causes 


-  In response ,  these people are expected to provide  steady inflow of information to the unit as well as various means of support and specific favors for it 


-  This networking was most evident in the case of the film company managing director ,  who even in one day exhibited an impressive network of contacts in order to negotiate her complex contracts with various media in different countries 


-  ,  In turn ,  people intent on influencing the behavior of an organization or one of its subunits will often exercise pressure directly on its manager ,  expecting that person to transmit the influence inside ,  as was most pointedly clear in the work of the parks managers 


-  Here ,  then ,  the managerial job becomes one of delicate balance ,   tricky act of mediation 


-  Those managers who let external influence pass inside too freely who act like sieves  are apt to drive their people crazy 


-  ( Of course ,  those who act like sponges and absorb all the influence personally are apt to drive themselves crazy! )  And those who block out all influence who act like lead to x-rays  are apt to detach their units from reality  ( and so dry up the sources of external support )  


-  Thus ,  what influence to pass on and how ,  bearing in mind the quid pro quo that influence exerted out is likely to be mirrored by influence coming back in ,  becomes another key aspect of managerial style ,  worthy of greatly increased attention in both the study of the job and the training of its occupants 


-  ,  If managers manage passively by information and affectively through people ,  then they also manage actively and instrumentally by their own direct involvement in action 


-  Indeed ,  this has been  long-established view of managerial work ,  although the excess attention in this century ,  first to controlling and then to leading ,  and more recently to conceiving  ( of planned strategy )  ,  has obscured its importance 


-  Leonard Sayles ,  however ,  has long and steadily insisted on this ,  beginning with his 1964 book and culminating in The Working Leader  ( published in 1993 )  ,  in which he makes his strongest statement yet ,  insisting that managers must be the focal points for action in and by their units 


-  But ,  in using this label   popular one in the managerial vernacular  ( Mary Anns  doer! )   it is necessary to point out that managers ,  in fact ,  hardly ever do anything 


-  Many barely even dial their own telephones! As already noted ,  watch  manager and you will see someone whose work consists almost exclusively of talking and listening ,  alongside ,  of course ,  watching and feeling 


-  ( That ,  incidentally ,  is why  show the manager at the core of the model as  head and not  full body! )  ,  What doing presumably means ,  therefore ,  is getting closer to the action ,  ultimately being just one step removed from it 


-  Managers as doers manage the carrying out of action directly ,  instead of indirectly through managing people or by processing information 


-  In effect ,   doer is really someone who gets it done  ( or ,  as the French put it with their expression faire faire ,  to make something get made )  


-  And the managerial vernacular is ,  in fact ,  full of expressions that reflect just this: doing deals ,  championing change ,  fighting fires ,  juggling projects 


-  In the terms of decision making introduced earlier ,  here the manager diagnoses and designs as well as decides: he or she gets deeply and fully involved in the management of particular activities 


-  Thus ,  in the day  spent with the head of the small retail chain ,   saw  steady stream of all sorts of people coming and going ,  most involved with some aspect of store development or store operations ,  and there to get specific instructions on how to proceed next 


-  They manage projects and solve problems ,  or put out fires ,  inside their units ,  and they do deals and negotiate agreements with outsiders 


-  This does not imply that projects are independent of problems ,  or that either are exclusively internal 


-  Indeed ,  the president of  large French systems company spent part of his day in  meeting on  very specific customer contract 


-  Asked why he attended ,  he said it was  leading-edge project that could well change his company 


-  Here the manager becomes  true designer  ( or ,  in the example above ,   partner in the design )  ,  not of abstract strategies or of generalized structures ,  but of tangible projects of change 


-  And the evidence ,  in fact ,  is that managers at all levels typically juggle many such projects concurrently ,  perhaps several dozen in the case of chief executives 


-  Hence the popularity of the term project management 


-  For one thing ,  they substitute ,  sometimes doing the routine work of their units in place of other people 


-  ( The front-country manager nearly spent part of the day cruising  river for the body of  person who had  few days earlier gone over  waterfall in  boat! )  Of course ,  when managers are replacing absent employees ,  this may be considered another aspect of handling problems 


-  Second ,  some managers continue to do regular work after they have become managers 


-  For example ,  the head nurse saw  patient  ( just as the Pope leads prayers ,  or  dean might teach  class )  


-  Done for its own sake ,  this might be considered separate from managerial work 


-  But such things are often done for very managerial reasons as well 


-  This may be an effective way of keeping in touch with the units work and finding out about its problems ,  in which case it falls under the role of communicating 


-  Or it may be done to demonstrate involvement and commitment with others in the unit ,  in which case it falls under the role of culture building in the role of leading 


-  ,  Doing outside takes place in terms of deals and negotiations 


-  Again ,  these are two sides of the same coin ,  in that managers negotiate in order to do deals ,  and also negotiate once the deal is done 


-  And ,  again as well ,  there is no shortage of evidence on the importance of negotiating as well as dealing in managerial work 


-  Most evident in my observations was the managing director of the film company ,  who was working on one intricate deal after another that day 


-  This was  small company ,  and making deals were  key part of her job 


-  In larger organizations ,  senior managers may have all kinds of specialized negotiators supporting them  ( for example ,  lawyers for contracts and labor relations specialists for union bargaining )  


-  Yet that does not release them from having to spend considerable time on negotiations themselves ,  especially when critical moments arise 


-  All around the circles ,  therefore ,  action connects to people who connect to information ,  which connects to the frame 


-  ,   opened this article by noting that the best-known writers of management all seem to emphasize one aspect of the job  in the terms we now have ,  doing for Tom Peters ,  conceiving for Michael Porter ,  leading for Abraham Zaleznik and Warren Bennis ,  controlling for the classical writers ,  and so on 


-  Now it can be appreciated why all may well be wrong: heeding the advice of any one of them must lead to the lopsided practice of managerial work 


-  Like an unbalanced wheel at resonant frequency ,  the job risks flying out of control 


-  That is why it is important to show all of the components of managerial work on  single integrated diagram ,  as in Figure  ,  to remind people ,  at  glance ,  that these components form one job and cannot be separated 


-  ,  Acceptance of Tom Peters urgings   Dont think ,  do is the phrase  favor15  could lead to the centrifugal explosion of the job ,  as it flies off in all directions ,  free of  strong frame anchoring it at the core 


-  But acceptance of the spirit of Michael Porters opposite writings that what matters most is conception of the frame ,  especially of strategic positions  could produce  result no better: centripetal implosion ,  as the job closes in on itself cerebrally ,  free of the tangible connection to its outer actions 


-  Thinking is heavy and can wear down the incumbent ,  while acting is light and cannot keep him or her in place 


-  Only together do they provide the balance that seems so characteristic of effective management 


-  ,  Too much leading produces  job free of content aimless ,  frameless ,  and actionless  while too much linking produces  job detached from its internal roots  public relations instead of public service 


-  The manager who only communicates or only conceives never gets anything done ,  while the manager who only does ends up doing it all alone 


-  And ,  of course ,  we all know what happens to managers who believe their job is merely to control  ( or ,  these days ,  to their organizations ,  as the detached managers escape in their golden parachutes )  


-  If  combine the more cerebral roles ,  we end up with  think-link-lead-do model 


-  Or ,  as someone who read this description remarked ,  Well then ,  management is  form of thinking and leading by doing 


-  ,   bad pun may thus make for good practice: the manager must practice  well-rounded job 


-  Or ,  if you prefer ,  anyone who wants to hold this job must swallow the whole pill  ( which may not ,  in fact ,  be  bad metaphor ,  since the outer coating of doing provides the immediate effect ,  while each successive layer in this time-release capsule provides deeper ,  less accessible ,  but more long-term effects )  


-  The different roles are somewhat substitutable ,  to be sure ,  for example ,  pushing employees through controlling by systems instead of pulling them through leading by culture 


-  ,  In fact ,  while we may be able to separate the components of this job conceptually ,   maintain that they cannot be separated behaviorally 


-  In other words ,  it may be useful ,  even necessary ,  to delineate the parts for purposes of design ,  selection ,  training ,  and support 


-  But this job cannot be practiced as  set of independent parts 


-  As noted ,  the core is  kind of magnet that holds the rest together ,  while the communication ring acts as  membrane that allows the flow of information between inner thinking and outer behaviors ,  which themselves tie people to action 


-  ,  Indeed ,  the most interesting aspects of this job may well fall on the edges ,  between the component parts 


-  For example ,  Andrew Grove ,  president of Intel ,  likes to describe what he does as nudging ,   perfect blend of controlling ,  leading ,  and doing 


- 16 This can mean pushing people ,  tangibly but not aggressively ,  as might happen with pure doing ,  and not coldly ,  as with pure controlling ,  but with  sense of leading 


-  Just consider all those chief executives who did the deal ,  acquired the company or whatever ,  and then dropped it into the laps of others for execution 


-  Likewise ,  it makes no more sense to conceive and then fail to lead and do  ( as has been the tendency in so-called strategic planning ,  where controlling has often been considered sufficient for implementation )  than it makes sense to do or to lead without thinking through the frame in which to embed these activities 


-   single managerial job may be carried out by  small team ,  but only if its members are so tightly knitted together  especially by that ring of communication  that they act as  single entity 


-  ,  Earlier  mentioned how leading ,  while identifiable as some activities ,  tends to infuse almost all managerial work 


-  In fact ,  at the limit ,  they blend into one another 


-  But  manager with considerable influence over an outsider  say ,   captive supplier  can exercise leadership as well as direct control ,  while one whose own employees begin to act as free agents may have to relate to them as  linker more than  leader  ( as the chief of any clinical service in  hospital can tell you )  


-  ,  To describe the various components that make up the job of managing as integrated ,  infused ,  and well rounded is not to imply that all managers do all of them with equal emphasis 


-  Managerial work does vary ,  according to the needs of  particular job and the approach of its particular incumbent 


-  Different managers end up emphasizing different things in different ways 


-  Paradoxically ,  however ,  this may best be understood through  systematic framework of what they all do in common 


-  Accordingly ,   use the model in Figure  to consider briefly some questions of managerial style  ( including the effect of context )  


-  Style is considered to impact on managerial work in three ways: which roles  particular manager favors ,  how he or she performs these roles ,  and what kind of relationship exists among these roles 


-  For example ,  as noted above ,  the managers of autonomous professionals ,  as in hospitals or universities ,  tend to favor linking over leading  ( let alone controlling )  ,  since professionals tend to come to their work naturally empowered 


-  In other words ,  they need little encouragement or supervision ,  although they do require considerable external support 


-  However ,  when experts must work in teams ,  as in some research laboratories or in professional sports ,  leadership becomes rather critical ,  particularly at the group level 


-  Entrepreneurs ,  in contrast ,  who run their own businesses ,  tend to emphasize doing  ( alongside conceiving )  ,  as they involve themselves deeply in specific issues 


-  Interestingly ,  the same thing tends to be true of first-line managers ,  even in conventional big businesses ,  for example ,  foremen in factories who must resolve steady streams of operating problems 


-  Senior executives of large diversified firms ,  on the other hand ,  give greater attention to controlling ,  particularly through their systems of performance control and their decisions to authorize major capital expenditures 


-  ,  Of course ,  regardless of the context ,  individual managers are often personally predisposed to favor particular roles or aspects of the job 


-  Considering this from the inside out ,  we can ,  for example ,  distinguish  conceptual style of management ,  which focuses on the development of the frame ,  an administrative style ,  which concerns itself primarily with controlling ,  an interpersonal style ,  which favors leading on the inside or linking on the outside ,  and an action style ,  which is concerned mainly with tangible doing 


-  And as we move out in this order ,  the overall style of managing can be described as less opaque ,  more visible 


-  Asked for advice by an employee ,  for example ,   manager may respond as  communicator  ( Payroll has some data on this )  ,   controller  ( Dont do it )  ,  or  leader  ( How do you feel about it? )  


-  ,  Second ,  regardless of which roles or aspects of the job  particular manager emphasizes ,  his or her personal style is manifested particularly in how these are performed 


-  We have already seen this ,  for example ,  in different approaches to linking at the extremes  ( the sieve ,  the lead ,  the sponge )  ,  and the different approaches to conceiving the frame  ( passive ,  driven ,  opportunistic ,  and determined styles )  


-  ,   final aspect of managerial style has to do with the interrelationships among the various components of managerial work 


-  For example ,  an important distinction can be made between deductive and inductive approaches to managerial work 


-  The former proceeds from the core out ,  as the conceived frame is implemented through scheduling that uses information to drive people to get action done 


-  But there is an alternate ,  emergent view of the management process as well ,  which proceeds inductively ,  from the outer surface to the inner core 


-  As Karl Weick puts it ,  managers act in order to think 


-  They try things to gain experience ,  retain what works ,  and then ,  by interpreting the results ,  gradually evolve their frames 


- 17 ,  Of course ,  the preferred approach may well vary with context as well as personal inclination 


-  When  situation is well understood ,  the cerebral style seems logical ,  while ,  under conditions of ambiguity ,  the insightful style may make more sense 


-  Part of our problem in recent years ,  in educating managers as well as in their own practice ,  has been  predisposition toward the cerebral style in situations of increasing ambiguity that require inductive insight 


-  Even doing is one step removed from the action: How then is  manager who relies on controlling three steps removed  to come to serious grips with any real problem in an organization? ,  Clearly ,  there is an infinity of possible contexts within which management can be practiced 


-  But just as clearly ,  perhaps ,   model such as the one presented here can help to order them and so come to grips with the difficult requirements of designing managerial jobs ,  selecting the right people to fill them ,  and training people accordingly 


-  It is in these areas that we are in greatest need of rich theory ,  and this kind of description may be one step toward the development of it 


-  In particular ,  the model may help in the hitherto intractable problem of delineating  useful list of competences that underlie the effective performance of managerial work 


-  ,  To give some idea of the flesh that might be put on the skeleton of this model ,  let me describe briefly  few of the managers  have observed 


-  This gives  sense of how context and personal predisposition interact with the various components of the job to define reality 


-  ,  Ann was intimately connected to the delivery of health care on  daily basis ,  knowledgeable about every imaginable detail of her hospitals operations 


-  It is people like her who keep the system running 


-  But mostly she seemed to maintain the internal operations by  certain amount of doing combined with  good deal of leading as well as some controlling ,  all infused with that spirit of the hive 


-  District management is necessarily detached from the daily delivery of health care ,  and so managing inside seemed to be restricted largely to formalized controlling ,  particularly with regard to systems of resource allocation 


-   found less doing here and not  great deal of leading 


-  As  result ,  buffering came naturally to this job 


-  ,  These are but  few of the managers in context ,  but their brief profiles may give  sense of the richness with which the work and the style of managing can be described 


-  We have  long way to go in understanding this most important of jobs 


-  automobile manufacturers have begun to heed the wakeup call that sounded more than  decade ago when Japanese automakers cut deeply into American markets 


-  Today ,  the Big Three have begun to rebound 


-  In 1993 ,  all three companies posted gains simultaneously for the first time since 1984 


-  The turnaround stems partly from exchange rates that now favor  


-  exports ,  and partly because output from Japanese transplants is included in the  


-  ,  In this paper ,  we examine  notable case ,  New United Motor Manufacturing  ( NUMMI )  ,  in which such learning produced significant cultural change 


-  Located in Fremont ,  California ,  in the shell of  huge GM assembly plant that had closed in 1982 ,  NUMMI opened two years later 


-  Now in its tenth year of successful operation ,  it has survived the trials that cause most joint ventures to founder 


-  NUMMI demonstrates how the introduction of  new production system and  foreign culture transformed one of the worst GM plants into  world-class assembly operation in  unionized environment 


-  NUMMIs experience ,  we think ,  has implications for other organizations that are trying to learn from each other ,  especially those that work across international boundaries 


-  ,  In 1989 ,  five years after the joint venture was created ,  we formed  team of five UCLA faculty members and graduate students to work in the plant and try to understand how such  radical transformation was possible 


-  Accordingly ,  we decided to work as ethnographers using participant-observation ,   method anthropologists and other social scientists use to study people in their natural settings 


-  While participant-observation has been successful in industrial settings ,  most studies have been limited to blue-collar workers or  single researchers efforts 


-  Our study traversed the company from the assembly line to top executives to track changes over time 


-  We spread through the company to tap into day-to-day life 


-  ,  In October 1989 ,  five of us began working in different groups on the assembly line that represented  range of performance from high to low 


-  Wearing NUMMI shirts and employee badges ,  we slowly became insiders ,  learning the Toyota production system firsthand ,  while establishing relationships with team members who taught us our jobs 


-  For four months ,  we worked on both first and second shifts at various stations ranging from stamping to chassis and final assembly ,  where we stacked body parts and installed engine components ,  bumpers ,  carpets ,  mufflers ,  door panels ,  and seats 


-  During downtime and breaks ,  we talked with team members ,  team leaders ,  and group leaders and recorded notes  ( with everyones knowledge )  


-  ,  Later ,  after we were accepted on the factory floor ,  we observed managers and engineers as they worked 


-  During the initial four-month period ,  we interviewed hundreds of people ranging from team members to the president 


-  The interviews ,  coupled with more than  thousand hours of participant-observation ,  produced nearly  , 000 pages of typed fieldnotes ,  which we cross-checked with each other each week and coded into  database 


-  We met periodically with  research committee of Japanese and American managers ,  union leaders ,  and team members ,  which validated the findings and directed our work in the plant 


-  Our intent was not to evaluate good or bad practices ,  but rather to piece together  composite picture of NUMMI from multiple viewpoints 


-  We also presented our findings to the company in periodic meetings with managers and team members 


-  For the next five years ,  we maintained  lower-level but constant presence at the company to track changes as the studys scope widened 


-  What is especially interesting is that Toyota and General Motors did not intentionally set out to develop  new culture in the abstract like so many other companies do 


-  Rather than creating slogans and the image of  new culture ,  they aimed to build  new organization designed around the Toyota production system 


-  That production system ,  however ,  rested on  radically different set of assumptions than did mass production 


-  In turn ,  the new assumptions and beliefs placed different demands on  


-  production workers and union leaders ,  most of whom came from the old GM plant 


-  Likewise ,  members of the management team ,  who were hired from Ford ,  Chrysler ,  and other GM plants ,  also had to learn new ways 


-  ,  Every organization contains  set of assumptions and beliefs for guiding individuals day-to-day working behavior ,  which together compose its organizational culture 


-  Beliefs grew from scientific management ,  which rationalized the division of labor and centralized authority ,  and formed the basis for an inflexible culture ,  making large companies vulnerable to more nimble ,  decentralized competitors 


-  Assumptions that led management and labor into generations of conflict similarly put many of Americas unionized smokestack industries at  competitive disadvantage with foreign companies with more cooperative labor relations 


-  However ,  in todays unpredictable and fast-changing economy ,  they impede organizations abilities to adapt ,  often making them unproductive 


-  For example ,  findings from our larger study of NUMMI ,  USS-POSCO ,  Douglas Aircraft ,  and Hewlett Packard show how Americas industrial growth led to the formation of  pervasive set of beliefs that have proven dysfunctional in the rapidly changing world economy 


- 10 ,  Studying organizational culture is difficult because there is no commonly accepted theoretical framework to explain what it really means 


- 11 To others ,  it is  system of beliefs ,  clues to deeper issues 


- 12 Its invisible quality also renders it elusive and difficult to grasp ,  much less to change 


- 13 The beliefs and assumptions ,  however ,  truly guide day-to-day behavior 


-  It reveals the critical role NUMMIs production system played in directing and maintaining the change in behavior and beliefs once the joint venture was launched 


-  ,  The original GM plant in Fremont ,  California ,  was built in 1962 as  state-of-the-art facility 


-  However ,  angry workers called it the battleship ,  partly because of its drab greenish-tan color ,  partly because of the endless conflict that raged there for twenty years 


-  As in other strife-torn GM plants ,  Fremont had  long history of heavy-handed management and union conflict ,  which had created an us versus them attitude 


-  The only time the two sides came together was to negotiate  new contract 


-  Detailed job descriptions and wage rates ,  negotiated in an atmosphere of mistrust ,  defined human roles impersonally and contractually 


-  In 1982 ,  when GM closed the plant and laid off the workforce ,  more than  , 000 grievances remained backlogged in the system 


-  Toyota needed  foothold in the  


-  auto market ,  and its executives wanted to learn whether its production system could be successfully implemented in the United States 


-  GM wanted to add  new small car to its line and also hoped to learn Toyotas production system 


-  ,  As Toyota began to negotiate with GM ,  its representatives were skeptical about working with  militant union like the United Auto Workers  ( UAW )  


-  GM and Toyota retained Bill Usery ,   former Secretary of Labor and head of the Mediation and Conciliation Service ,  to represent their mutual interests 


- 15 Usery ,  no stranger to adversarial relationships ,  had reservations that he confided to then-UAW president Douglas Fraser: ,  Fraser acknowledged the risks of working with the Japanese but also recognized the significance of the new venture and committed the unions support 


-  ,  Wrangling broke out within the International union over whether to insist on the traditional work rules in the master contract or to give in to Toyotas demands for abolishing seniority as  base for hiring and collapsing the myriad job classifications 


-  Many UAW veterans resisted giving up seniority and job classifications ,  which represented the accomplishments of  lifetime of struggle 


-  Bruce Lee ,  the UAWs western regional director ,  and others in the UAW argued that retaining these protections would only slow the recovery of the  


-  Lee commented: ,  With support from outgoing UAW president Fraser ,  incoming president Owen Bieber ,  and Don Ephlin ,  head of the UAWs GM department ,  the union was able to give Toyota the assurances it needed 


-  Its executives agreed that the joint venture would rehire the majority of its workforce from the pool of laid-off GM workers ,  and that it would recognize the UAW as the bargaining agent for the workforce 


-  The UAW in turn agreed to accept the Toyota production system ,  to increase greatly the flexibility of work rules ,  and to simplify the job classifications 


-  Part of the agreement letter indicates the tone of the new relationship: Both parties are undertaking this new proposed relationship with the full intention of fostering an innovative labor relations structure ,  minimizing the traditional adversarial roles ,  and emphasizing mutual trust and good faith 


-  ,  In 1985 ,  its first year of operation ,  NUMMI assembled 64 , 766 Novas   car that has been hailed by leading consumer magazines as one of the highest-quality small cars 


- 16 Workers daily attendance averaged 98 percent in 1985 ,  and only  handful of grievances were filed 


-  NUMMI was cited in union magazines as having changed into  worksite unlike any other in the UAWs experiences 


-  Newsweek called NUMMI a model of industrial tranquility ,  while the Wall Street Journal reported that NUMMI has managed to convert  crew of largely middle-aged ,  rabble-rousing former GM workers into  crack force that is beating the bumpers off Big Three plants in efficiency and product quality 


- 17 ,  Tatsuro Toyoda ,  son of Toyotas founder ,  headed NUMMIs management team 


-  Kan Higashi ,  also  Toyota executive ,  became executive vice president; Dennis Cuneo ,  whom Higashi hired from  Washington firm that assisted Toyota in the joint venture negotiations ,  became head of NUMMIs legal affairs 


-  Cuneo joined NUMMI partly because he was convinced that it represented  watershed case in American antitrust law: ,  Gary Convis left  ten-year career with Ford in Cleveland ,  Ohio ,  to head manufacturing 


-  Bill Childs was hired from General Dynamics to establish NUMMIs human resources and labor relations departments 


-  Though regarded as  hard-liner by many in the plant ,  Childs saw NUMMI as an opportunity to alter the prevailing model of antagonistic labor-management relations 


-  ,  After ten years ,  NUMMI continues to improve 


-  Today ,  the plant represents  $1 


-  The number of workers has grown from  , 200 to more than  , 300 and is projected to increase in 1995 


-  ,  NUMMI produces the same number of cars as GM did in the same plant ,  but with much higher quality and half the workforce 


- 18 ,  At NUMMIs tenth anniversary ,  General Motors president Jack Smith ,  head of the GM side of the negotiations ,  commented ,  Ten years ago  lot of people thought NUMMI would never get off the ground 


-  But today ,  with the quality and efficiency that NUMMI has achieved ,  it is the mecca of the auto industry in North America 


-  Tatsuro Toyoda ,  president of Toyota ,  remarked ,  I have  special place in my heart for this company 


-  NUMMIs success proves that labor and management can work toward mutually beneficial goals that serve the best interests of everybody 


-  ,  There have been  variety of explanations for NUMMIs achievements ,  none based on first-hand research in the plant 


-  Even people inside NUMMI were unsure about the reasons for its success 


-  Some think NUMMIs success resulted from workers being unemployed for two years and willing to accept almost anything to regain their high-paying jobs 


-  Others attribute its achievements to the careful job-application screening process 


-  ,  Our evidence suggests that if GM had set out to recreate the plant from its old workforce ,  it would have failed ,  because old beliefs were too deeply etched into the psyches of managers and workers to accommodate the necessary radical change 


-  Gary Convis explained how working with the Japanese was  powerful form of training: ,  GMs seasoned ,  experienced workforce provided  hospitable environment for the Japanese contributions 


-  Most of the people we interviewed said they would not go back to work for GM ,  even if it reopened across the street 


-  Most NUMMI employees take pride in the quality of the cars they build under the new system 


-  In  recent survey ,  93 percent said they were proud of their work 


-  The joint venture inherited  work-force of people who had known each other for many years 


-  Friendships cut across lines that might divide others ,  creating an open atmosphere 


-  Their tolerance helps unite the multicultural ,  multiethnic workforce ,  often bridging serious conflict 


-  Employees speak proudly of the plants diverse workforce ,  commenting that differences between people are  source of strength 


-  Jesse Palomino ,   former UAW committeeman explained ,  This place is  blend 


-  Sherry Ward ,   seasoned GM autoworker ,  commented on how she felt when  Fortune article reported that NUMMIs workers came from the barrio and the ghetto:20 ,  As the company worked to fuse the Japanese and American beliefs into  single unit ,  it discovered four principles without which little progress could have been made 


-  ,  The management team knew from the beginning that unless it overcame the old adversarial management-labor relationship ,  the new venture would founder 


-  Workers were skeptical about Bruce Lees decision to appoint the old GM bargaining committee as the new ventures bargaining agent because of its leaderships reputation for militancy; these twenty-five individuals were now expected to guide the union into  new era of cooperative labor-management relationships 


-  However ,  by being included in decision making from the outset ,  they could test managements commitment to teamwork ,  trust ,  and respect 


-  Because the committee members were also influential in establishing the mutual vision between management and labor ,  they recognized that their futures were intertwined ,   first step in creating  model of cooperative labor relations 


-  But he also knew these people were important allies: ,  As an elected union official ,  Lee had  great deal at stake 


-  If the union cooperated and gave away some of its traditional job protections to provide the flexibility Toyota demanded ,  and if the workers found the conditions intolerable ,  Lee would quickly become the target of union opposition 


-  If you come back and say ,  Bruce ,  this just doesnt work ,  then Ill say ,  Fine! Well try something else 


-  ,  At the startup in early 1984 ,  union leaders and newly hired managers together stuffed envelopes with job applications 


-  Five thousand former GM workers received applications with  letter explaining how new employees would be expected to contribute to an atmosphere of trust and cooperation and that poor quality workmanship and absenteeism would not be tolerated 


-  In the end ,  85 percent of the newly hired men and women had worked in the old GM plant 


-  According to Bill Childs ,  only 300 applicants were rejected outright  because of unusually poor work histories or drug or alcohol problems 


-  ,  Many of the UAW locals leaders had difficulty setting aside old antagonisms to work with the company 


-  However ,  both DeJesus and Nano knew that the joint venture offered  chance for their members to go back to work 


-  Nano described conditions at GM ,  where he headed the bargaining committee 


-  But we forgot that theres got to be smoke coming out of the stack or theres nothing to fight about 


-  ,  Toyota sent 400 trainers from Japan to work with American counterparts to teach the production system that would become the leverage for cultural change 


-  At the same time ,  NUMMI invested more than $3 million to send 600 of its new employees to Toyota for training 


-  At Toyota ,  Tony DeJesus learned the system ,  while getting to know the Japanese 


-  At first ,  they communicated in sign language: ,  The bonds of friendship and mutual understanding became more important as Americans and Japanese felt the stresses and strains of starting the new company 


-  The policy also stipulates that before anyone is laid off ,  all outside contract work will be dropped and executives will take substantial pay cuts 


-  At first ,  workers distrusted the policy because it was so unusual ,  but it has now been tested at least four times  and each trial has made the company more credible 


-  auto companies would have laid off the second shift ,  but NUMMIs management stood behind its policy and fired no one 


-  Team members not needed on the line were retrained in the basics of the new production system ,  teamwork ,  and problem solving 


-   recent company survey showed that 80 percent of the team members agreed that job security was the most important aspect of working at NUMMI 


-  The policy also fostered the workers belief that they are valued as assets rather than as costs to be trimmed during downturns and reinforces managers respect for their employees 


-  Gary Convis remarked: ,  Convis explained that when something goes wrong on the line ,  most  


-  managers look for  culprit someone who is slacking off or doing something wrong 


-  In contrast ,  Convis said: ,  Kan Higashi explained that ,  from the beginning ,  Toyota understood the need to establish the concept of fairness 


-  He wanted  general leveling  fewer levels of management ,  no executive perks ,  and  blurring of lines between Japanese and Americans ,  managers and team members 


-  Higashi admitted that ,  after  fifteen-hour day ,  he wanted nothing more than to fraternize with his Japanese colleagues ,  but he resisted: ,  As Toyotas production system was introduced ,  the management team and the union compressed job classifications and created  flat wage structure that equalized work and rewards while fostering fairness 


-  GMs former eighty job classifications were collapsed into only three one production class and two higher-paid skilled trades classes  each of which falls into the same $19 to $21 hourly wage rate 


-  More recently ,  NUMMI instituted  bonus system ,  based on gainsharing ,  that benefits all employees equally 


-  ,  NUMMIs flat wage structure also reinforced the feeling that the companys fortunes depended on everyones efforts 


-  Many American managers believe that employees are motivated to work hard only by incremental pay increases ,  not by flat wage rates 


-  To the contrary ,  Convis explained: ,  As Toyotas production system has diffused to NUMMI ,  some adaptations have been made ,  but its key features have endured 


-  One is that each employee must be responsible for product quality   significant departure from tradition at GM 


-  By standardizing work and by removing excess inventory through just-in-time delivery ,  Toyotas pull system creates  tight link with the customer 


- 21 It demands that individuals work together interdependently and cooperatively for the common good 


-  ,  The system runs at  preset speed known as takt time  ( the German word for meter or musical rhythm )  that determines the length of time  team member has to perform his or her task ,  currently set at sixty seconds 


-  Because the time standard is observed throughout the plant ,  it levels the work  known as heijunka  while keeping the line under continuous tension 


-  ,  By running the system with few buffers and using human motion sparingly ,  problems can be traced to their root causes through kaizen ,  or continuous improvement 


-  Toyotas jidoka principle ,  that jobs are to be done correctly the first time ,  minimizes the chance that defects will be passed down the line 


-  However ,  workers are obligated to stop the line when they see  problem by pulling the overhead andon cord 


-  Empowering workers to stop the line was  radical change from the old GM plant 


-  The superintendent would have your ass 


-  One manager remarked ,  When theres no downtime ,   know that my people are sending junk through ,  or theyre trying to be super-stars 


-  His comment reflects NUMMIs philosophy that each group should generate  few minutes of downtime each day because each imperfection represents an opportunity for improvement 


-  ,  Another element that reinforces interdependence is making performance data available 


-  Standardized work and kaizen charts hang in the team areas ,  along with attendance boards and defect records 


-  But if youre up there more than once for the same defect ,  watch out! ,  Managing  system like NUMMIs is difficult because it is dynamic and requires constant adjustment to change 


-  When NUMMI reaches its goals ,  team members and managers naturally tend to become complacent ,  which causes quality to suffer 


-  Some veteran auto-workers interpret these cycles as  return to old GM days ,  which generates fear and uncertainty 


-  On  cycles downside ,  defects increase ,  causing management to exert corrective pressure that stresses the entire organization 


-  ,  Osamu Kimura ,  NUMMIs third president ,  described  constant need to renew the spirit by finding problem areas and accelerating improvements 


-  For instance ,  in 1991 ,  when complacency had set in and quality began to suffer ,  Kimura launched the J-1 program: We made it  campaign with buttons and banners ,  so that employees could see our commitment each day 


- -built compacts and number one for compact trucks 


-  ,  However ,  when the pressure gets too great ,  managers sometimes fall back on old ways 


-  He learned to trust that productivity would follow quality by following the systems principles 


-  Mulleague commented that it was difficult at first to grasp what Higashi meant when he said ,  I dont care if you build only six cars  day ,  as long as they meet our quality standard 


-  Mulleague remarked: When the pressures on ,  half of the people in this place will revert to their old ways  pushing cars out the door ,  and Im no exception 


-  ,  Discipline is critical to NUMMIs system 


-  When managers fail to follow the systems principles ,  order breaks down ,  quality suffers ,  and relationships become strained 


-  However ,  when management consistently observes the systems principles ,  quality and productivity achieve  natural balance 


-  For example ,  in trial runs in 1993 ,  team members found that some new parts were difficult to install on the new models 


-  Convis described how the problem held up production for weeks ,  inceasing pressure as the schedule slipped: ,  Team members and managers traced the problems to the parts suppliers ,  where they were remedied 


-  It develops from working together productively under stress 


-  For example ,  pressure from management caused an experienced group leader ,  Roger Gallet ,  to eliminate  job on the line without first consulting his group 


-  During the morning break ,  Gallet informed his team members ,  with whom he had worked for  number of years ,  that he had already made the change 


-  Pandemonium followed ,  as one team member shouted angrily ,  You know ,  weve got  stake in this place too! Why werent we consulted? Arent we important? Another team member blurted ,  Managements got to learn to play by the rules 


-   dont want to see this place fold ,  but this is sure as hell no way to run  plant 


-  As music signaled the end of the break ,  the meeting broke up without resolution 


-  Hes got to know how we feel 


-  ,  At the end of the shift ,  Gallet called an impromptu meeting and explained ,  I was under pressure this morning ,  and  didnt want to hear what you had to say 


-  After the meeting some of the team members tried to soften the mornings harshness by tapping Gallet on the arm ,  making friendly comments as they went to their lockers 


-  It became apparent how the trust that had developed between Gallet and his group over the years played an important role by absorbing conflict and redirecting energy 


-  For instance ,  management announced  policy that groups should rotate jobs every two-and-a-half hours to reduce injuries ,  level the work ,  and break boredom 


-  Anger spread as one woman shouted ,  Why not find out what the majority wants? Let me tell you ,  sir ,  youre gone  good deal of the time ,  and you dont know what goes on here 


-  Facing the group ,  he said ,  There are some things you vote on and some things you dont 


-  There is  time to get input ,  but  dont have to take  vote on it or get your blessing 


-  His manager and  member of the human resources department counseled the group leader in more effective ways to foster participation and handle conflict 


-  His performance has improved ,  and he still works at the plant 


-  ,   large element of building trust lies in NUMMIs participative style of management 


-  NUMMI does not have  democratic system in which workers and managers vote on issues ,  but rather open decision making ,  which enourages individuals to contribute 


-  Convis explained its importance: ,  Every voice in  decision has value and must be heard; managements job is to honor opposing forces ,  draw them together ,  and reconcile them in the decision-making process 


-  ,  NUMMI has now survived for nearly  decade 


-  Secure workers are more productive ,  and as  companys productivity increases ,  its market share expands 


-  Toyota invested another $340 million in the plant and expanded the workforce by about 900 employees 


-  Team members witnessed how this principle translated into opportunity ,  as the plant grew and new jobs were created 


-  Japanese coordinators taught their American counterparts how to extend decision making to workers 


-  They gained the respect of most NUMMI employees because of their detailed job knowledge and willingness to ignore status differences and work on solving problems 


-  ,  Tony Fisher ,  who worked for GM and now heads NUMMIs environmental affairs ,  described the power of consensual decision making ,  The Japanese ask questions and seem to talk endlessly about solutions 


-  It may take  long time to make  decision ,  but once its made ,  thats it 


-  Pity the person who tries to undermine the decision once its made 


-  Fisher recounted his introduction to Toyotas beliefs ,  which he found could be easily integrated with his own: I always believed in including people in important decisions 


-  The Japanese are non-Christian and look what they do! ,  Finally ,  though some team members complain about the systems demands for discipline ,  most agree that ,  under GM ,  discipline had become too lax 


-  Team members and managers respect the self-discipline the Japanese bring to their work 


-  One manager marveled at how the Japanese analyze  problem: Theyll sit there and spend hours on it ,  asking hundreds of whys until its solved 


-   team member on the final assembly line explained that he likes the Japanese discipline because it fosters orderliness and pride in the company 


-  He characterized NUMMI as  family in which the parents have to insist on what they want: When GM ran this place ,  it looked like  dump  chicken bones in the cars ,  broken glass in the parking lot 


-  The parking lots clean ,  just like the rest of the place 


-  Hayao Kawai ,   Jungian analyst and professor of education and Japanese studies at Kyoto University ,  explained the basis of the Japanese communal spirit: ,  Kawai described how Japans ancient animistic religions conceived of the center ,  where Christians place God ,  as nothing 


-  This principle extends to the inclusive concept of lifetime employment 


-  ,  The Japanese concept of self as part of  larger community reveals itself in numerous ways at NUMMI 


-   Toyota senior coordinator explained how he first noticed the difference between Americans and Japanese in sports competition: ,  Interestingly ,  the clash over communitarian and individualistic values occurs in the areas on which Japanese and Americans most easily agree  employment security ,  participative decision making ,  and plant discipline 


-  Over time ,  interest in the exercises died ,  though the music still played 


-  One team member ,  who appreciates the Japanese influence ,  nevertheless quit the exercises: They just went too far 


-  The children know that if they work for Toyota ,  theyll be taken care of 


-  We dont have anything like that here 


-  Thats why the Toyota model in its pure form wouldnt work here at NUMMI 


-   young Toyota coordinator expressed concern with the distance between American workers and their employers: Japanese workers make  lifetime commitment to their employers ,  but Americans lack this sense of belonging 


-  We work to live ,  not live to work 


-   dont think the American worker will ever be like the Japanese 


-   just dont think that model would ever work here 


-  ,  Sometimes tension surfaces ,  as Toyota coordinators press the fine points of the system and unknowingly transgress this imaginary line 


-  For example ,  after the first shift ,   senior Toyota coordinator was training  group of managers in standardized work 


-  According to the standardized work part sheet ,  six trays should have been on the left ,  and two on the right 


-  workers fear losing their individualism 


-  One night at  party after work ,   group from chassis discussed  team member ,  Ramon ,  who had left early after angrily denouncing the company and the team concept 


-  Ramon was known as  complainer ,  doing as little work as possible and counting the days until retirement 


-  This is most evident in how Toyota introduced the production system to the American workforce 


-   senior Toyota coordinator reinforced Higashis view ,  saying that ,  at Toyota ,  he simply explained how to do something ,  and team leaders followed without question: But ,  at NUMMI ,   didnt get the same reaction 


-  He had to compromise because he could not force his way on the American workers: The new way had to be localized 


-  Otherwise ,  team members simply refuse to participate 


-  It took  year for me to discover  way to get the Americans to agree with me 


-  Only after they reached mutual agreement ,  would NUMMI employees share their ideas and make suggestions on how to improve the system 


-  ,  Osamu Kimura noted that the cultural exchange has worked both ways: Despite our differences as Japanese and Americans ,  we found that we share many important similarities 


-  Kimura has  personal style that managers and team members appreciate 


-  He worries ,  however ,  that language obscures the fine points of communication so critical to building relationships: ,  Another Toyota coordinator explained how personal relationships with his  


-  He described GM and Toyota like oil and water and NUMMI like  small salad bowl: ,  NUMMI has so far weathered pressures that have caused others to founder ,  and its culture continues to evolve 


-  Since the late 1980s ,  Toyota has gradually recalled its management and technical team ,  which today includes Iwao Itoh  ( NUMMIs fourth president )  and about twenty-five managers and coordinators 


-  However ,  Toyota began to scale back its presence at NUMMI only after being assured that its key principles had been successfully diffused ,  and that the American management team had learned to manage the dynamic system 


-  Itoh ,  like his predecessors ,  is fully conscious of the continuous reinforcement needed to keep the system from slipping into  comfortable zone of complacency: My greatest challenge is to make sure that both managers and team members truly internalize the concepts 


-  management team remains nearly intact 


-  Internal quality audits done by Toyota ,  GM ,  and NUMMI over the last few years were validated in May 1994 ,  when NUMMIs Geo Prizm won the highest score ever for an American-built vehicle 


-  The Federal Trade Commission noted NUMMIs importance when ,  in late 1993 ,  it set aside its original order limiting the joint venture to twelve years 


-  The commission explained that it made the decision because of evidence that NUMMI was helping General Motors reap the benefits of gaining first-hand experience with an efficient production system 


- 25 For instance ,  union leaders and team members had to suspend hard-learned beliefs that management would take advantage of them in order to learn Toyotas principles 


-  When individuals learned that they would share fairly in the fruits of the companys success ,  they began to embrace the systems principles and let go of old ,  dysfunctional beliefs 


-  The impetus came partly from the shutdown and resulting unemployment ,  but more so from two added factors: NUMMIs commitment to treating its workforce fairly ,  and Toyotas integrated production system that demanded participation ,  mutual respect ,  and trust 


-  ,  Second ,  Toyota assumed dominance in the joint venture and took full responsibility for teaching the Americans how to implement and manage its production system 


-  The Japanese partners beliefs and management style were more in tune with market demands for quality and speed ,  as well as with employees needs for cooperation ,  trust ,  and respect 


-  Agreeing on who was responsible for day-to-day management at the outset enabled Toyota to administer consistent direction from the top ,  which sent  message of consistency and stability to the rest of the company 


- 26 ,  Third ,  Toyota managers resisted temptations to forge ahead with  pure version of the system 


-  By tolerating ambiguity and by searching for consensus ,  Toyota managers established the beginnings of mutual respect and trust with the American workers and managers 


- 27 Mazdas assembly plant was not  joint venture ,  although it had some characteristics similar to NUMMI in its agreement to hire an all-union workforce 


-  However ,  Mazda failed to lay sufficient groundwork and establish  mutual cultural understanding with the  


-  workers 


-  The UAW local confronted Mazdas management and resisted the introduction of its production system 


-  Grievances mounted and Mazda tried to exert control by ordering workers not to speak publicly in hopes of avoiding negative publicity 


-  Cooperation and teamwork broke down as the UAWs New Directions ,   wing of the union that opposes cooperation with management ,  won control 


-  Thus ,  despite Mazdas hopes for  cooperative ,  profitable venture with its unionized American work-force ,  the companys failure to examine both its own and the UAWs beliefs and assumptions led to  morass of conflict that could have been avoided 


-  Toyota has successfully diffused its principles ,  and the company has enjoyed nearly  decade of continuous expansion 


-  It has thus demonstrated to its workforce that ,  by converting waste to value-adding activity through continuous improvement ,  market share and resulting employment will grow 


-  manufacturers have begun to adopt some of the principles introduced by Toyota at NUMMI ,  it is still unknown just how far or in what form these lessons have permeated 


- 28 As other manufacturers embrace Toyotas principles ,  it is also unclear how the system will endure if economic conditions change ,  demanding cutbacks and layoffs 


-  Also unclear is what new manufacturing and management paradigms will emerge and how lean systems like NUMMIs will adapt 


- Several years ago at IBM Credit Corporation ,  arriving at  quote for computer financing involved five business functions and ,  on average ,  took seven days  even though customers and sales representatives were anxiously awaiting the outcome 


-  Now ,  coming up with  quote takes six hours ,  largely because one person handles the entire deal from start to finish 


-  The company issues more than ten times as many quotes as it did in 1985 ,  using  computer for more than half of the quotes 


-  And IBM is beginning to issue quotes in real time on the customer site ,  by combining yet another role with that of doing the deal  selling the computer 


-  IBM account executives have become representatives of IBM Credit 


-  ,  At Pacific Bell ,  providing  business customer with Centrex telephone service once took eleven jobs and more than five business days 


-  Service representatives had to update at least nine computer systems with the correct information ,  making frequent errors and rework ,  and consulting customers several times 


-  Using  computer workstation that interfaces with all nine systems ,  they provide the customers service in no more than  


-  days; if the order is for  type of service predefined in network software  ( as in 80 percent of orders )  ,  it is usually done the day of the order 


-  Order rework is down substantially 


-  ,  The Internal Revenue Services collections division once had  very complex process for collecting taxes from delinquent taxpayers ,  which involved six different functions and much time spent on locating taxpayer files 


-  When the agency built  new computer system for tracking cases ,  the collections and backlog improved dramatically ,  with major reductions in number of employees and offices ,  but worker morale declined and turnover increased 


-  Only when collections teams handled entire cases to completion did collections improve in both productivity and job satisfaction  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  These organizations are taking actions that counter  century of conventional wisdom about how jobs and organizations should be structured 


-  Throughout the industrial age ,  the emphasis has been on seeking efficiencies through the detailed functional specialization of jobs or the so-called functional division of labor 


-  Now ,  however ,  many firms are beginning to move toward combination ,  not division ,  of labor 


-  They are using individuals or small teams to perform  series of tasks ,  such as the fulfillment of  customer order from beginning to end ,  often with the help of information systems that reach through the organization 


-  ,  Some of the firms that have implemented this radical new work design call it  case management approach ,  referring perhaps to social work case managers who help their clients interface with multiple social agencies and bureaucracies 


-  One of the first organizations to affix the case management label to  redesigned process was Mutual Benefit Life ,  an innovative  ( albeit financially troubled )  insurance company in Newark ,  New Jersey 


-  It transformed its process for underwriting and issuing an insurance policy from an operational nightmare  it required forty steps ,  twelve functions ,  eighty jobs ,  and an average of twenty-two days  into  case management process involving one person ,  assisted by two others 


-  Case managers handle each policy from application to issue in two to six days ,  while cutting costs by more than 40 percent 


-  Though the firms real estate portfolio has led it into great difficulty ,  the case management process was functioning well before new business began to decline ,  and many other insurance firms have since adopted the same process 


-  Figure  depicts  simple model of case management in  manufacturing order management process 


-  ,  We have observed new case management structures in more than fifteen firms in  variety of manufacturing and service industries ,  including these: ,  Some of these firms have now had several years of experience with case management; others have created case management roles but are still implementing supporting systems and structures 


-  ,  While case management presents exciting possibilities for process design and execution ,  it is not usually adopted without problems and issues 


-  Furthermore ,  neither of the two approaches to providing information to case managers  implementing  broad ,  integrated new system or providing networked links to old ones  is entirely satisfactory 


-  Finally ,  there are limits to how much job functionality can be incorporated into  case management environment 


-  Before exploring these difficulties ,  however ,  it is important to explain the concept and the promise of this work design 


-  We have observed four components of  successful case managers role: ,  Case management is an appropriate design for work that is performed along process lines rather than in business functions 


-  Case management is particularly useful in processes that deal with customers ,  which involve managing the entire cycle of activities from customer order to product or service delivery ,  billing ,  and payment 


-  The process approach to work ,  which specifies  structured set of activities resulting in  specified output for  specified customer ,  originated in the quality movement 


-  Case management is ,  for most organizations ,   radical departure from current work organization and is usually adopted with objectives of order-of-magnitude gains in time ,  cost ,  or quality 


-  ,  Like other radical process designs ,  case management implies broad processes that cut across the existing functions of the firm 


-  Any process approach is  shift from the functional structures familiar to most firms; case management is particularly distinctive because it achieves cross-functional integration by combining several functions into one job 


-  Not only are they liaisons between these different functions and customers ,  but they actually perform the work previously done by the functions 


-  Moving to case management ,  therefore ,  inevitably involves considerable change in both organizational structure and business processes 


-  The difficulty of such change ,  however ,  reflects the difficulty  customer has with todays highly functionalized ,  segmented organization 


-  As one Dow Chemical executive put it ,  The fact that we are  multifunctional ,  multidivisional ,  multi-SBU organization is not our customers fault 


-  It is seen as  way to provide the customer with faster and more complete service than before ,  with minimal handoffs and the ability to give customers the status of work in process 


-  At Mutual Benefit Life ,  for example ,  the case managers were not only  way to process more efficiently and hence speed up the time to complete  policy ,  but also  way to provide the customer with  broader array of more responsive services 


-  This requires job expansion and making case managers responsible for dealing directly with customer issues ,  instead of having to get approval from senior managers or managers with relevant expertise 


-  When well designed ,  case management makes the back room and the front room indistinguishable 


-  It is  vehicle for literally presenting one face to the customer  long  slogan at many firms ,  but rarely achieved when the product or service is spread among many different departments and workers 


-  ,  Several of these components of case management could have been  and in some cases were  implemented in the past 


-  Though it would have been counter to most prevailing organizational structures ,   firm could have created  closed-loop process and could have given greater decision rights to front-line personnel 


-  Without recently developed ,  powerful ,  and flexible workstations and supporting software tools ,  there would have been no way to pull together all the information necessary to make case management work  unless ,  of course ,  the firm had been oriented to broad processes in building its mainframe system architectures ,  which is very unlikely 


-  Information technology is not necessarily the most important component of case management ,  but it was the most limiting in the past 


-  We know of several banks ,  for example ,  that have constructed integrated customer files ,  allowing tellers or other front-line employees to access customer information across bank products and departments 


-  But because they do not allow users of the customer data to represent all of the banks products ,  little cross-selling or relationship management can occur 


-  ,  Many other firms have implemented roles at the intersection of sales and operations to coordinate order management ,  but without role expansion ,  supporting information technology ,  and decision-making authority ,  these liaison roles are just Band-Aids on an inefficient business process 


-  One high-tech manufacturer we studied created  case managerlike role to handle the order fulfillment process for key accounts 


-  Yet because managers insisted that the role be nonexempt  ( and thus low in status )  ,  the case managers never had access to key information from the functional groups that the role was intended to coordinate 


-  In case management ,  less than all might as well be nothing 


-  ,  Though case management is beginning to seem routine in many firms ,  it is  major departure from the way we have organized work since the Industrial Revolution 


-  For the organizational thinkers of the nineteenth century ,   key aspect of modern organizational life was the division of labor 


-  Adam Smith described the division of labor in the manufacture of pins: ,  In manufacturing ,  experimentation with more complete jobs began many years ago ,  though few firms have had more positive results than with the assembly line 


-  For routine ,  structured tasks ,  whether they involve manufacturing or service processes ,  it is difficult to beat highly specialized jobs and sequential organization for efficiency 


-  There is also evidence that the workers  ( at least in the United States )  who hold these jobs are often reasonably satisfied with them 


-  As one worker in the automobile industry put it ,  If Ive got to bust my ass to be meaningful ,  forget it; Id rather be monotonous 


-  ,  Based on conventional wisdom ,  many service industries as well as service functions also adopted the assembly line model ,  though it rarely worked as well as it did in manufacturing 


-  Jobs were narrowly defined ,  and the problems they addressed required only low levels of expertise ,  leading to monotony and difficulty in assessing  workers contribution 


-  Furthermore ,  assembly line structures did not deal well with tasks that required coordinating many different functions or roles 


-  Each highly segmented role created the need for  buffer  ( in-box and out-box )  and  communications interface ,  which greatly increased the time to complete the service 


-  In an age of speed and time-based competition ,  these delays have become even more problematic 


-  In many insurance firms ,  for example ,  we have found ten-to-one ratios between elapsed time and value-added time in  cross-functional work process 


-  Customers had  way of interfering with the best-laid plans for how work should flow 


-  They called when their applications or policies or orders were in midstream ,  forcing  halt in the flow to find their file 


-  They wanted their orders expedited ,  which slowed down all the others 


-  For all these reasons ,  firms tried to isolate the front-line people from the back-office producers 


-  If organizations want to be responsive to customers ,  they can hardly consider interacting with customers an interruption in their work 


-  In short ,  the assembly line model is not well suited to work problems involving interfunctional coordination and high customer service levels  ( see Table  )  


-  ,  The assembly line model ,  of course ,  is not the only alternative to case management as  form of work organization 


-  For decades ,  firms have also employed cross-functional teams for certain types of tasks 


-  Therefore ,  such permanent teams are not well suited to highly structured tasks 


-  ,   third alternative to case management is the structure based on relatively independent functional experts ,  such as scientists in  research-oriented organization ,  or physicians in  hospital 


-  For the tasks described in Table  ,  the functional expert structure excels only at high-expertise tasks and  ( sometimes )  those involving customer service and interruption 


-  Functional experts are not efficient at permanent task execution ,  particularly of highly structured tasks 


-  Cross-functional coordination is the most difficult problem in such work environments 


-  ,  Viewed in the context of Table  ,  the benefit of case management is its flexibility to handle multiple tasks 


-  The combination of high efficiency at relatively structured tasks ,  coordination across multiple roles ,  use of IS to coordinate the expertise of an entire organization ,  responsiveness to customers ,  and the ability to execute all these tasks permanently is difficult to resist in many different types of businesses 


-  ,  Not only customers but also employees benefit from case management  at least those employees who can fit into these demanding jobs 


-  Case managers can see  task through to completion and gain self-esteem from their employers trust in their ability to make the right decisions and actions 


-  They learn  broad range of processes through the lens of  case management workstation and face  wide variety of issues and challenges 


-  Their jobs are not easy but are always interesting 


-  ,  In general ,  organizations with complex processes for bringing their products and services to market are the best candidates for case management 


-  In manufacturing industries ,  case management is best suited to order management processes requiring frequent and close interaction with customers   


-  ,  when there are many products to choose from ,  when products are configured to  customers specification ,  when scheduling of  customers order is difficult ,  or when services are combined with products 


-  Of course ,  this sort of environment in manufacturing  sometimes called the service factory  is becoming increasingly common 


-  Firms must be careful ,  however ,  not to include too many tasks in the role 


-  ,  At Dell Computer ,  for example ,   recently designed case manager position both takes and executes customer orders and also provides technical support for Dell products 


-  However ,  the reengineering team determined that updating the technical support knowledge base and doing market segmentation were activities that ,  although related to customer support ,  took place in  different time frame and might distract front-line workers from their customer duties 


-  ,  In service industries ,  the most feasible environments for case management are those in which the service cannot be performed simply and straightforwardly in assembly line fashion 


-  ,  as in  health care institution )  


-  These service industry environments might be called service job shops 


-  In an ideal world ,  organizational handoffs in business processes where there is interaction with customers would be transparent to the customer; in the real world ,  however ,  that does not often happen 


-  One consumer goods firm we studied ,  for example ,  had five divisions ,  each with its own order-processing systems ,  selling to the same retail customers 


-  ,  There is  tradeoff ,  however ,  in designing relatively complex case management roles 


-  The broader the set of functional tasks involved and the organizations linked ,  the more difficult it is to find good case managers 


-  One issue is that to service customers directly and to complete or oversee the work for those customers is  difficult combination of activities ,  in terms of both skills and logistics 


-  Few case managers in insurance ,  for example ,  are both expert at underwriting and good at convincing customers to buy policies 


-  The issue of location may also limit the breadth of case management 


-  For example ,  at Pacific Bell ,  the Centrex provisioning process also involves some tasks that require  person to be at  switching center to connect cable pairs 


-  Case managers sitting at  workstation could not handle this job ,  so the company retained the role of facility provisioner 


-  ,  In general ,  while case management is an innovative and attractive design for customer-interacting work processes ,  it raises many issues of implementation and fit with the existing organization 


-  ,  In creating case management environments ,  the firms we studied faced several issues 


-  Managers must deal with such implementation issues as the proximity of the case manager to the customer ,  the decision rights granted to case managers ,  the supporting information architecture ,  the level of monitoring ,  and the choice between individuals and teams as case managers 


-  Case management also has several implications that continue after the role and its activities have been initially established ,  such as for human resource requirements and policies 


-  It is too early in the life of case management to have definitive answers for all these issues 


-  But it is not too early to focus on some of the major problems that must be resolved and point out what can be learned from the experiences of some pioneers in case management 


-  ,  Even though case management is  way to increase customer responsiveness ,  only some case managers deal face to face with customers 


-  Many case management roles thus far established deal with  field salesperson ,   selling agent ,   broker ,  or some other intermediary who deals directly with the customer 


-  Thus case managers are frequently one step removed from the customer ,  though they sometimes have direct contact when they provide customer service 


-  Firms may be reluctant to give sales agents access to the full information that comes with case management particularly when they are not employees but independent agents 


-  Firms also fear that the salespersons incentives may not be closely aligned with their own 


-  For example ,  when we told  mortgage companys chief financial officer that the trends in his industry would eventually lead to  case manager who would issue mortgages in real time at the customer site ,  he responded that his company couldnt tolerate the risk of combining the sales ,  appraisal ,  and loan approval roles 


-  For example ,  Lithonia Lighting ,  the largest manufacturer of lighting fixtures in the United States ,  has designed  system called Light*Link that places all its relevant information in the hands of independent sales agents 


-  Lithonia agents can access  great deal of information about the internal operations of Lithonia such as production scheduling ,  pricing policies ,  and so on 


-  Lithonia has also provided them with  number of expert systems so that they can respond to customer requests for quick lighting designs  for an office building or for  baseball park 


-  ,  Similarly ,  although it created  case management role at headquarters that greatly improved the quote generation process ,  IBM Credit felt that ,  to generate quotes sufficiently rapidly ,  it must move quote generation to the IBM field salesforce 


-  Until IBM develops new compensation schemes based on the long-term profit of  deal ,  these account executives would seem to have every incentive to give away the store to get  customers business 


-  However ,  preliminary results from combining these roles indicate that the salespeople often make deals that are more favorable to IBM Credit than those headquarters was able to arrange 


-   few salespeople have even experimented with giving the workstations to customers and letting them create their own deals 


-  IBM Credit was bold simply because it had to be  it couldnt make the process work quickly enough when it was centralized at headquarters 


-  Furthermore ,  it had  long history of working with the field salesforce to glean information about customers 


-  ,  IBM Credits experience illustrates the full spectrum of proximity to the customer  from isolation to case management by the customer 


-   few other firms we encountered planned eventually to move case management to the customer 


-  At Bell Atlantic ,  for example ,  the case management process involved working with customers to help them select or change long distance carriers 


-  It would probably not work well ,  for example ,  in underwriting insurance or issuing home mortgages ,  where the customers interests may not coincide with those of the insurance or loan provider 


-  ,  Certainly ,  moving case management very close to the customer involves risk 


-  Case managers who both execute and sell may decide ,  for example ,  to take their business elsewhere or to satisfy customers at the firms expense 


-  Though few firms have been as bold as Lithonia and IBM Credit ,  several insurance companies  ( particularly those with captive agents )  and manufacturing firms are hoping that once they can demonstrate case managements success as an intermediary between the firm and its salesforce ,  they will be able to move the role and its capabilities gradually into the field 


-  In some organizations ,  such as direct suppliers like Dell Computer ,  the salesforce is not in the field ,  and customer orders are taken primarily at headquarters 


-  In such cases ,  moving case management close to the customer is the only alternative 


-  ,  Another consideration in designing case management roles is the level of decision-making rights in serving customers 


-  Case management generally implies  high level of autonomy ,  but just how much freedom in making decisions is appropriate? We believe the answer is ,  As much as possible without causing problems elsewhere 


-  An example of case management at Xerox illustrates the tradeoffs in establishing decision rights 


-  ,  Xerox has begun to implement case manager roles in its order management process 


-  The result of the redesign is  consolidation of multiple functions into two roles ,  customer contact employees  ( CCEs )  and customer support employees  ( CSEs )  ,  which together form  case management team  ( or micro-enterprise unit ,  as Xerox calls it )  


-  Using substantial information technology ,  these two roles will oversee the entire process of managing an order ,  from giving the customer  proposal to collecting revenues 


-  ,  The new roles ,  particularly the CCEs ,  have substantial decision-making authority 


-  Xerox created  broad set of decision rights for the roles and then pared away detailed policies and procedures to match the stated rights 


-   number of management levels are eliminated ,  which increases decision-making power 


-  In fact ,  there is only one level of managers above the CCEs ,  and they mentor and advise the CCEs ,  rather than provide close supervision 


-  Customer satisfaction is  primary factor in the CCEs performance evaluations ,  which also support customer-oriented decision making 


-  Case managers have  great deal of pricing flexibility ,  but they cannot offer prices below the government price ,  which must be the lowest possible price by definition 


-  ,  Case managers cannot do their work if they are not empowered to meet customer needs in creative and sometimes unorthodox ways 


- 10 ,  Developing an information architecture to deliver all relevant information to the case managers desk is ,  for many firms ,   herculean task 


-  Since most systems in the past have been built along functional lines   sales system ,   logistics system ,   manufacturing system  creating  customer-focused architecture typically involves building or buying new systems from the ground up 


-  Companies can expect to spend tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars to create such an architecture ,  and it often fails 


-  Several attempts at creating customer-focused architectures for the banking industry ,  such as those by Hogan Systems and Westpac Bank ,  have been abandoned after many years of effort 


-  They are creating frontware or composite systems that pull data from various functional databases  ( or ,  more commonly ,  smaller extracts from those databases )  ,  transmit it across existing corporate networks ,  and integrate it at the case managers workstation 


-  Case managers can then see into the entire firm without  total change of systems 


-  ,  Pacific Bell ,  for example ,  has established an organizational unit to create just this type of system 


-  In the Centrex example described above ,  the Strategic Integrated Systems group developed  front-end system that guided provisioning caseworkers through the steps necessary to handle an order correctly ,  using such databases as equipment inventory ,  customer requirements ,  and installation schedules 


-  Because the underlying databases and network applications are quite complex ,  the front-end system determines what questions to ask the customer and in what order 


-  The system and the case management approach are now operating in several regions of Pacific Bells service area and have substantially reduced both provisioning time and errors 


-  ,  Yet these frontware workstations are no panacea for information systems architectures that are functionally based 


-  First of all ,  aging functional systems may not provide the right kinds of information and may be expensive to modify and maintain 


-  Building frontware systems may relieve pressure to replace them  but the pressure may be  useful source of motivation 


-  Because of concerns about the robustness of the front-ware approach ,  many of the IT managers we have interviewed question this interim approach ,  even in firms where it is supporting case management today 


-  They fear that multiple investments in temporary case management systems will eventually lead to an unmanageable jumble   gridlock of ad hoc systems ,  database extracts ,  and locally managed computers 


-  We believe that most firms should work on both short-term frontware systems and long-term architectures until there is more evidence that the composite approach is viable over the long term 


-  ,  Because the handling of customers and information about the customer interface are typically concentrated in the case managers role ,  issues of monitoring job tasks in case management environments are common 


-  We have seen examples of extremely high and low levels of monitoring that disturbed the corporate culture 


-  ,  At the Internal Revenue Service ,  the activities and performance of the collections agents ,  or case managers ,  were closely monitored and controlled through the computer system supporting the collections process 


-  The computer system made it possible for supervisors to monitor directly the case managers behavior instead of relying on after-the-fact measures of their performance 


-  The system measured the duration of calls ,  time at and away from work ,  dollars recovered per unit of time ,  and many other factors 


-  Also ,  the agency had expended considerable resources on the new computer system and wanted to justify the expenditure with productivity increases 


-  ,  The new process ,  computer system ,  and associated controls were very successful in economic terms 


-  While the efficiency of the process and the dollars collected from it increased markedly ,  so did the agent turnover rate and the dissatisfaction of supervisors 


-  Many employees felt that they were overcontrolled ,  and even supervisors complained about spending too much time on monitoring and control 


-  The agency eventually backed off on the level of monitoring and moved to greater levels of team self-management 


-  Case management teams now do the monitoring 


-  Supervisors can spend more time teaching agents about tax matters and advising teams on how to achieve better performance ,  rather than on individual monitoring 


-  ,  At the other extreme of control  ( albeit for  different reason )  ,   network engineering group in  telecommunications services firm wanted to relax the information controls on its case managers 


-  The group built  workstation for providing new-customer circuits that greatly reduced the cycle time for this process but also bypassed the previous mainframe databases that documented and managed the network 


-  At least to some ,  these systems were necessary for ensuring network integrity 


-  Needless to say ,  the new workstation-based system led to  major political battle that raged for more than  year until the advocate of the workstation-based approach was promoted ,  which assured its adoption 


-  In the meantime ,  the company incorporated some of the original controls into the workstation 


-  ,  For most firms ,  the correct approach to case management monitoring is in the middle of the spectrum ,  but with  bias toward less monitoring and more accountability and responsibility 


-  Since case management always involves information technology ,  and IT is extremely useful for monitoring work ,  most employers need to resist using all the employee performance information available 


-  ,  One somewhat paradoxical aspect of case management is its potential for low job satisfaction 


-  At first blush ,  this seems to be  job that would fulfill even the most challenge-oriented employee 


-  It involves high levels of autonomy and decision-making authority ,  completion of  broad set of tasks ,  and interfaces with many parts of the organization 


-  These are ,  according to theorists of work motivation ,  key aspects of rewarding and enriching jobs 


-  ,  One facet of case management ,  however ,  can radically reduce its work-life quality 


-  The job is mediated through  computer workstation or  telephone ,  so some case managers feel chained to the computer or phone 


-  They feel that they are not doing their jobs if they are not peering at the screen ,  typing at the keyboard ,  or talking on the telephone 


-  Even when the job involves analyzing real customer problems or talking to real customers on the telephone ,  tangible social interaction is lost 


-  Even the tangibility of paper and files is missed; as one case manager put it ,  Instead of putting  completed file into the out-box ,   feel like  am sending it into  black hole 


-  ,  The most common way to address this problem is to create case management teams ,  rather than relying on isolated individuals 


-  When case management requires the combination of highly specialized functional skills ,  teams of specialists can maintain their functional identities and be members of  case management team 


-  At Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers ,  Florida ,  for example ,  case management teams specialize by the types of patient problems they are equipped to treat 


-   particular care center may focus on cardiology or cancer ,  but the patient will receive care from only ten members of  team ,  rather than from the normal range of sixty to one hundred care givers 


- 11 The case management teams we have observed ,  however ,  are working well 


-  Those firms that view teams as only an interim step in case management ,  such as in Bell Atlantics carrier access organization ,  may find that they lose more in job satisfaction than they gain in efficiency when they abandon teams for individual case managers 


-  ,  However ,  one insurance firm we have studied is attempting to create team-based case management without significantly changing structure ,  location ,  or skills 


-  The team will have to access multiple systems in order to complete  case 


-  ,  This environment strains the definition of case management; it is really just  permanent cross-functional team 


-  Though the process for issuing insurance policies may be streamlined ,  we doubt that the order-of-magnitude benefits the firm desires can be achieved 


-  We also question whether  group of individuals without common jobs or location really constitutes  team 


-  ,  There are many human resource issues in case management 


-  The skills ,  compensation ,  performance evaluation criteria ,  and career paths of case managers are normally quite different from those of other employees 


-  Yet because case managers manage cases rather than people ,  they wreak havoc with traditional human resource policies in these areas 


-  ,  At Mutual Benefit Life ,  human resource issues were the most difficult aspects of the shift to case management 


-  Those employees who were capable of becoming case managers faced great uncertainty about how the firm would measure their performance ,  how much they would be compensated ,  and where their careers would lead 


-  The personnel department didnt understand how difficult the case manager role was and how much compensation it should receive 


-  Because the case managers had no subordinates and worked at  computer ,  the department wanted to classify the job as clerical 


-  The team that designed the case manager role had to work long and hard to convince personnel that case managers should be paid not only more than secretaries ,  but also more than underwriters 


-  High-achieving case managers also had initial difficulties with the idea that ,  as they progressed ,  they would not change job titles but would simply deal with more challenging cases 


-  Employees who could not master case management jobs felt betrayed 


-  Few of these employees ,  however well-trained ,  could perform the difficult and broad set of case management tasks 


-  Since the breadth of the job demanded not only trained skills but also high intelligence and  customer-oriented personality ,  only so much of the gap could be addressed through training 


-  Some of the employees picketed the firms headquarters to show their frustration 


-  ,  Many of these problems seemed insurmountable until one executive became the manager of the personnel function and of the information systems function ,  which had been very active in establishing the case manager role 


-  Thereafter ,  the firm implemented new programs to address both short- and long-term issues arising from case management 


-  Xerox and PHH Fleet America have adopted this same organizational combination of systems ,  process ,  and human resource responsibilities; it seems that when technology and processes change ,  so do jobs ,  and it is very helpful to have all of these resources managed under one roof 


-  ,  Though some organizational theorists have suggested that the functional structure will disappear in the process-oriented organization ,  we do not expect that even extensive case management will eliminate functions entirely 


- 12 In the firms we studied ,  case management replaced some functions ,  resulted in shrinkage to  small group of functional experts in others ,  and left some fully intact 


-  Functions were replaced completely when the expertise levels needed to perform the functional tasks were very low 


-  When expertise can be taught to case managers or put into information systems ,  the result is usually an organizational structure that reduces functions in size and power but does not eliminate them 


-  Small groups of functional experts can still perform several valuable functions ,  including training and certifying case managers in their skills ,  helping to design ever-better expert systems to support case managers ,  and occasionally rotating into the case management role themselves 


-  ,  PHH Fleet America currently uses this case management structure of smaller but still critical functions ,  and case managers now perform most services for its customers fleet management requirements 


-  Functional areas have shrunk in size as they have given up operational duties to case management-oriented processes ,  and case managers report directly to process owners ,   


-  The few employees who remain in the functional areas continue to perform important roles ,  however ,  in creating and maintaining functional expertise among case managers and dealing with the customers most difficult questions 


-  For example ,  if  customer calls in with  maintenance problem on  fleet car ,  two times in three the Driver Services case managers can solve it using an expert system and the skills they have learned 


-  They refer the more difficult cases to expert maintenance mechanics ,  who can not only solve the problem but also add it to the case managers knowledge base if it is  recurring issue 


-  ,  In environments involving very high levels of expertise ,  there is an equal mixture of case management and functional experts 


-  This appears to be the situation in hospitals that have implemented case management approaches  ( or care teams as they are sometimes called )  


-  Although hospital case management teams can assume most patient care duties  ( including administering tests and medication ,  monitoring response to treatments ,  and overseeing preparation for and recovery from operations )  and also coordinate  patients movement from primary to acute to ancillary care ,  specialists are still needed for operations 


-  When case managers cant do everything ,  there is  clear need to specify where their responsibilities begin and end ,  and under what circumstances experts should be called in 


-  ,  In general ,  case management leads to strains in the organization 


-  Because it is  role based on  process view of the organization ,  some aspects of case management will frequently conflict with functional or divisional structures and with existing policies and procedures 


-  Functional managers will complain that the time-honored procedures and expertise of their functions are ignored 


-  Risk-averse executives will worry about including so much in one job 


-  IT managers will be concerned that case management technology is not rationally or reliably designed 


-  All affected employees will question how they fit into  case management structure 


-  Companies embarking on the case management role should be aware that many such conflicts will arise and be prepared to manage them 


-  ,  The keys to managing resistance to case management are well-known change management principles 


-  Communication with all concerned parties about the business objectives for adopting case management ,  the vision for how the process will work ,  and the likely impacts on these stakeholders is critical to securing cooperation 


-  Letting functional managers and employees in particular know about their long-term fates is the way to retain valued employees during ambiguous periods 


-  Furthermore ,  the sooner that employees know what skills are necessary to succeed as case managers ,  the earlier they can begin to prepare themselves with education and training 


-  ,   final approach to securing employee commitment to case management-oriented processes is one that we call partial work design 


-  In this approach ,   reengineering team designs from the top down the high-level description of  work process ,  including its inputs and outputs ,  performance objectives ,  organizational structures ,  and key technological enablers 


-  The case managers or teams who will perform them daily design the detailed work flows and activities of the process 


-  Their design participation builds adherence to the process and the job and reduces the alienation resulting from  Taylorist separation of work design from execution 


-  ,  The instances of case management we have observed thus far have been for single ,  specific processes at the customer-organization interface 


-  Because these initial efforts have yielded substantial benefits ,  companies have begun to explore whether they can extend case management concepts to  broad range of processes ,  including those such as financial transactions that are entirely within the organization 


-  ,  Even if case management is restricted to customer-interfacing processes ,  its value can be further extended into the organization 


-  For example ,  because the case manager oversees an entire customer transaction ,  he or she can provide useful feedback to product or service development 


-  An insurance case manager ,  for example ,  could suggest new insurance products based on customer requirements and report on customers comments 


-  ,  If we extrapolate case management trends to the extreme ,  organizations of the future could become collections of different types of case managers ,  each handling  closed-loop process for an internal or external customer 


-  The ad hoc networks bringing information to case managers desktops  ( or laptops )  would be the firms primary information architecture 


-  The organizational structure would be the case management nodes themselves  as individuals or ,  more likely ,  teams  and the communications and other relationships between them 


-  Before its financial problems ,   Mutual Benefit Life manager responsible for designing case management spoke of the one-person insurance company ,  which he saw as  logical extension of case management 


-  ,  Another alternative direction for case management is to move it out to the customer 


-  As already noted ,  IBM Credit is already exploring turning its customers into case managers ,  and this is  stated direction for Bell Atlantics carrier access case managers 


-  Of course ,  such  direction relies heavily on information technology to do most of the case work 


-  Furthermore ,  the issues of decision rights ,  breadth of the case management role ,  and monitoring all become greatly amplified  and potentially dangerous to customer relationships  when the customer is the case manager 


-  ,  Whether case management remains internal or external ,  it clearly presages more autonomous and networked work units 


-  And unlike most examples of the networked organization ,  it currently exists in many firms 


-  However ,  it is not possible at this point to understand if this networked autonomy is  positive long-term direction ,  or what issues will emerge if it catches on and burgeons 


-  The firms that pioneered case management have yet to adapt fully their organizational structures to suit the new role 


-  The functional structure is still in place ,  and most managers we interviewed believe it will always remain because of the need to maintain functional skills 


-  In insurance ,  for example ,  even when  case manager who has many other roles performs underwriting ,  the need for underwriting standards ,  training ,  and assessment does not go away 


-  ,   firm implementing case management today should start modestly ,  combining several functions and jobs and observing the outcome 


-  If combining labor rather than dividing it works well on this small ,  though radical ,  scale ,  the firm should add other functions to existing case manager roles and apply the concept to other areas within the organization 


-  Case management may not be relevant to all businesses and all processes ,  but it is being widely adopted across multiple industries ,  and firms are achieving substantial business benefits from it 


-  It has the potential to become the future of all business organizations ,  and it has already become the present for some
