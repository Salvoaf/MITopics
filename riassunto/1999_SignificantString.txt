- As companies aspire to become market-driven ,  they exhort employees to get closer to customers ,  stay ahead of competitors ,  and make decisions based on their markets 


-  Yet ,  even the best-intentioned senior managers find it difficult to translate those aspirations into action 


-  Failed or flawed change programs have many symptoms ,  most of which are traceable to  lack of commitment to the deep-seated changes needed 


-  The organization hasnt fully grasped what it means to be market-driven  or why it matters  and lacks  clear path to that end 


-  Further problems occur if the change program is unsuited to the task of orienting the business to its present and prospective markets 


-  ,  While the underlying principles and prescription of generic change programs offer valuable guidance ,  the organization must sensitively tailor the design of  change program to become market-driven to the particular challenges of understanding ,  attracting ,  and keeping valuable customers 


-  My purpose in this article is to establish the six conditions that ensure change process success 


-   use the experiences of four different change programs  Fidelity Investments ,  Sears Roebuck ,  Eurotunnel ,  and Owens Corning  and post-audits of some failed change initiatives to validate the change model and explain the necessary conditions for  durable shift to  market orientation 


-  ,   firms orientation to its present and prospective markets is subject to two pressures 


-  On one side are the centripetal influences that induce the company to look inward for guidance on decisions and become remote from customers and unresponsive to competitive challenges 


-  This influence is accentuated by  liability of success where good financial performance leads to arrogance ,  overconfidence ,  and  technology orientation that condones the belief that we know better than the market 


-  Compounding the problems are the centrifugal effects of market ,  technology ,  and competitive change that continually pull the business out of alignment with its markets and erode its advantages 


-  The interplay of these forces leads to one or more of the following triggers for change: ,  Each of these triggers started at least one of the four change programs described in this article 


-  ,  When managers at Fidelity Investments scanned the retail investment landscape in 1993 ,  they saw  host of new or energized competitors ,  including discount brokers ,  banks ,  and insurance companies ,  the emergence of independent financial advisers offering unbiased ,  comprehensive advice ,  and customers who were concentrating their investments with fewer firms 


-  Fidelity was not  full-range provider of investment vehicles ,  nor did it have the low-cost advantage of Schwab or Vanguard with  stable of index funds ,  lean organization ,  and frugal culture 


-  ,  Fidelitys pressing need was to cement and extend its relationships with the most valuable prospects in its large customer base by offering  value proposition that product-focused competitors couldnt match 


-  It could accomplish this by providing credible advice tailored to the situation 


-  The theory was compelling but the reality was that the organization was geared to providing standard service to everyone ,  and the systems couldnt identify which accounts were profitable and worth pursuing 


-  The prevailing culture ,  structure ,  rewards ,  and measurements were all at odds with the strategy aspirations 


-  ,  The change program proceeded on four fronts at the same time 


-  This meant simultaneously picking the customer segments to nurture while building the systems infrastructure so Fidelity could identify and serve these attractive segments ,  and redesigning core processes for customer acquisition ,  retention ,  and optimization 


-  The most difficult part was persuading the prevailing culture to accept  market-driven strategy of differentiated service 


-  The inevitable resistance was overcome with organizational changes that moved accountability to segment managers ,  and measurements and rewards based on profitability ,  retention ,  and share of wallet 


-  ,  Sears Roebuck is  classic case of what happens when  firm loses touch with its markets 


-  billion loss and overcome  declining market share ,  bloated costs ,  and some of the worst customer satisfaction ratings in the retail industry 


-  Customers were being rapidly siphoned off by trendy specialty retailers such as The Limited ,  category killers like Home Depot ,  or discounters like Wal-Mart and Target 


-  Within 100 days of his arrival ,  he and his team began to plan for the closing of 113 unprofitable stores ,  the termination of the 100-year-old Sears catalogue ,  and the divestment of the financial-services business 


-  The quick-fix worked ,  but the real challenge was to turn  short-term survival program into  long-term transformation that fully engaged employees who were dispirited and anxious for improved performance 


-  Although the prevailing assumption was that Sears was  mens store ,  women made  majority of the buying decisions 


-  Martinez ,  who refocused on the softer side of Sears and introduced new private-label lines of apparel and cosmetics ,  summed up the challenge: A turnaround is  financial recovery 


-  Its all about changing the structure and the approach to the business and reeducating our people to feel comfortable outside  command-and-control environment 


-  When it completed construction ,  it had to transform itself from  project organization to an operating company with its own rolling stock for transporting trucks and cars through the tunnel 


-   change in culture wouldnt suffice; it needed  complete reversal 


-  The entire company had to transform from spending whatever it took to finish the tunnel to controlling costs and earning money 


-  It had to become efficient to attract ,  serve ,  and retain customers that could compete against the established ferries and airline services 


-   sense of urgency developed as Eurotunnel projected huge and unacceptable losses if it didnt make big cuts to its bloated cost structure 


-  However ,  the change process focused on growing revenues ,  as the company judged this to be an energizing goal that would overcome early suspicions that the process was merely  cost-cutting exercise 


-  ,  The first step was to organize around customers and processes and jettison the old functional structure 


-  The company devised separate teams and strategies for the truck ,  rail ,  and tourist travel segments 


-   team with strong support at the top guided the overall change and in turn created  complex change architecture that involved more than  , 000 people in eighty-five different cross-functional teams 


-  Priorities for teams dealing with everything from timetable planning to introducing  club-class service were guided by customer inputs 


-  ,  When Glen Hiner left General Electric in 1991 to join Owens Corning ,  manufacturer of fiberglass insulation ,  glass composites ,  and roofing materials ,  the company was mired in debt ,  besieged by asbestos litigation ,  and suffering from  bunker mentality 


-  Owens Corning managers had  product orientation that made sense ,  given the realities of  business with cyclical sales and  capital-intensive process for making fiberglass that was cost effective only when it ran continuously at high speed 


-  ,  While the company focused on its materials ,  its customers were thinking about their projects 


-  Home improvers had problems with unreliable contractors ,  scant information ,  and unforeseen problems 


-  The materials were secondary ,  and the customers couldnt distinguish among brands anyway 


-  ,  Owens Corning recognized that the compelling value proposition of offering one-stop shopping and solutions to problems posed by projects was well beyond its capabilities 


-  There were big gaps in its product line ,  and the balkanized sales and service organization couldnt offer  simple way for customers to buy  complete portfolio of products 


-  The company had to overcome serious information bottlenecks and rethink how information flowed through it and to and from its customers 


-  ,  What do the experiences of Fidelity Investments ,  Sears Roebuck ,  Eurotunnel ,  and Owens Corning have in common? Each had to change to get closer to its market and satisfy and retain customers or face dire consequences 


-  None used an off-the-shelf package; each tailored  change program to fit its heritage ,  market strategy ,  and leadership personality 


-  Yet each change program had some features in common with other successful initiatives 


-  ,  First ,  the entire organization from top to bottom was involved 


-  This multifunctional boundary-spanning effort could not be left to  part-time task force or given to the human resources or marketing departments 


-  ,  Second ,  the focus was on the conditions enabling people to produce good results  not on the characteristics of the change leaders 


-  Thus Fidelity initially emphasized the clarity of its strategy in terms of segments and value propositions and the adequacy of the customer database and front-end systems as necessary conditions to process and organizational redesign 


-  ,  Third ,  top management created  sense of urgency to energize the program ,  most likely achieved with  real or manufactured crisis that exposed flaws in the firms approach to customers 


-  Managers can manufacture  crisis by painting  scenario in which the firm is defunct in ten years or by having teams adopt the role of  predatory competitor 


-  ,  Fourth ,  cultural change followed from behavioral change 


-  Although culture is always  major impediment to change ,  there is no evidence that efforts to change it first will succeed 


-  Change happens by altering behavior patterns and helping people understand how new behavior relates to performance improvement 


-  Eventually ,  these changes will be absorbed into the underlying norms ,  beliefs ,  and mind-sets 


-  ,  Finally ,  the change programs generated useful diagnostics on progress through the process ,  which were used to encourage learning about success and identify barriers 


-  ,  Successful change programs have six overlapping stages:7 ,  These steps are not sequential 


-  Each stage interacts with and reinforces other stages throughout the process 


-  An ongoing series of experiments and early successes creates opportunities for learning and helps maintain momentum 


-  Frequently ,  investments in infrastructure are necessary to carry out the strategy 


-  Fidelity began the development of  data warehouse at the start of its change program because it understood that integrating customer information across the organization was necessary to its strategy of attracting high-potential customers 


-  ,  Does the company have  leader who  


-  ,  How can top managers signal their commitment and successfully persuade the entire company that its performance hinges on satisfying target customers better than competitors do? The answer depends on the CEOs style ,  the magnitude of the change in values and beliefs ,  and the past history of change efforts 


-  The following actions convey the message throughout the company: ,  All these moves signal senior management commitment 


-  But how can  real sense of urgency be infused deep into the organization? One could argue that the performance problems of Sears Roebuck and Eurotunnel would have been enough to galvanize their organizations 


-  Unfortunately ,  as John Kotter observes ,  this is not enough: ,  In most organizations today ,  the sense of urgency is much too low 


-  Ironically ,  this can happen even in an organization where anxiety and anger are high 


-  They think the problems are out there ,  not within the organization or themselves 


-  Angry or scared employees arent going to try to figure out how to make major improvements 


-  ,  The CEO at each of the four firms tackled this problem and created  sense of urgency by setting aggressive targets for improvement 


-  Sears Martinez posed five new strategic priorities  core business growth ,  customer focus ,  cost reduction ,  responsiveness to local markets ,  and organizational and cultural renewal 


-  He also set difficult goals: within two years ,  Sears would quadruple its margins to achieve industry parity ,  reverse the share decline ,  and improve customer satisfaction by 15 percent 


-  At Owens Corning ,  Glen Hiner explicitly signaled that raising cash to cut the debt was no longer the priority: it was time to grow 


-  In 1993 ,  he wanted the company to grow revenues from $2 


-  billion to $5 billion by 2000 by supplying everything needed for the envelope of the house 


-  Similarly ,  Eurotunnel management set ambitious targets for revenue growth by making the tunnel the preferred choice for all segments ,  while also committing to aggressively cutting costs to address the big operating loss 


-  To continue to prosper ,  the company had to earn  much larger share of its customers wallets 


-  ,  It is more difficult to infuse urgency when  business has been doing well 


-  In 1996 ,  Allied Signals Larry Bossiday explained that the $15 billion defense and auto parts conglomerate would have to be changed as much in the next five years as in the previous five years  (  period when the stock quadrupled )  ,  We have  long way to go in terms of understanding our customer 


-  Im asked all the time ,  What worries you the most? And the predominant worry is ,  Are we going to be able to satisfy ever more demanding customers?  was talking to somebody in the food business the other day 


-  In the aerospace industry ,  you used to deliver in thirty-day windows 


-  Do we have the processes  the overnight processes to deliver in ten-minute windows? Some of our competitors will have them someday ,  so wed better be prepared 


-  To meet these challenges ,   companys people have to feel urgency and commitment 


-  ,  Companies have used two approaches to inculcate  deep understanding of the need for change ,  always starting with the customer 


-  Then managers can see where to reorient the organization and identify priorities 


-  ,  Regardless of how the customers views become part of the process ,   company must observe two rules: First ,  all members of the management team  R&D ,  manufacturing ,  and field service  should have first-hand contact with customers 


-  Until everyone has heard complaints and frustrations ,   sense of urgency will not be pervasive 


-  Managers who believe their firm excels may refuse to acknowledge the need for change; customers may abet this belief by holding back negative information 


-  ,  Sears customer task force reviewed past survey data and conducted eighty focus groups for direct feedback 


-  The task force asked participants why they shopped at Sears ,  what they wanted ,  what they expected ,  and what they disliked 


-  The findings were at odds with the avowed values ,  Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back and Take care of the customer ,  which seemed to have lost their meaning 


-  ,  Instead the task force heard endless stories about shoppers disappointment with out-of-stock merchandise ,  nonexistent sales help ,  bad service ,  and time-consuming returns 


-  ,  It is not enough to interview current customers; many of the best insights come from defectors or attractive prospects in the target market who have never shopped or bought anything 


-  Defectors pinpoint shortcomings and reveal what competitors are doing to capture customers 


-  ,   company should also involve lower-level employees during this stage 


-  Many sponsor employee workshops to define customer expectations ,  reasons for defection ,  and opportunities for change 


-  The most energizing part of the workshops is having multifunctional teams visit the competitors stores ,  outlets ,  branches ,  or sales points to analyze how they deliver value to customers and create  different experience 


-  These workshops are concrete and understandable and confront employees with competitive reality 


-  ,  After confronting reality as defined by target customers expectations and competitors abilities  the management team candidly assesses the companys progress in creating the culture ,  capabilities ,  structure ,  and strategy of  market-driven organization 


-  Team members normally disagree on how well their organization is performing ,  reflecting different frames of reference ,  recent experiences with customers ,  functional backgrounds ,  and organizational level 


-  ,  In 1994 ,  Dow Chemical had abundant reasons for adopting  stronger market orientation: investors complained about the cyclical performance in commodity chemicals ,  new competitors with lean business models challenged ,  and customers indicated that they had new requirements that Dow wasnt meeting 


-  The company gave  standard survey to all managers , 11 which had benchmark results for peer companies 


-  While 65 percent of senior management was positive about the companys market orientation ,  middle managers gave the firm much lower marks  ( 32 percent )  ,  and salaried employees ,  24 percent 


-  According to its own managers ,  Dow was in the bottom third of peer companies ,  with an overall rating in the thirty-second percentile for all companies in the benchmark survey 


-  Given the spread in judgments across the levels ,  it was clear that some people were out of touch ,  most probably the senior managers 


-  The reactions followed  familiar pattern: confusion at first ,  then resistance and denial ,  including objections to the premise of the survey ,  followed by gradual acceptance of the findings and the need for deep-rooted change 


-  The president ,  who brought customers to board meetings and established multifunctional task forces to lead the change process ,  drove the change program 


-  ,  Do all employees  


-  ,  In November 1993 ,  Sears Martinez asked his change team how the five strategic priorities announced in March were progressing 


-  One forthright senior manager stood up and said ,  To be perfectly honest ,   dont know what Im supposed to be doing differently 


-  It became clear that top managements strategic priorities werent meaningful to the rest of the organization 


-  The problem was that the five priorities lacked broad ownership and employee engagement 


-  An organizations members do best when there is  clear connection between the strategy for delivering superior customer value and the members individual contributions 


-  Each of the four companies worked hard to convey the larger picture to their employees and enable them to develop  vision and strategy that supported the overall effort 


-  ,   coalescing vision for Owens Corning was system thinking ,  which pushed the notion that roofing ,  exteriors ,  insulation ,  and sound absorption are all systems that work together to solve customers problems 


-  Under this type of umbrella ,  product developers have clear priorities ,  merchandising and advertising are easier to target ,  relationships with contractors are closer ,  and systems provide the integrating information 


-  ,  Early in the change process ,  Sears managers articulated  vision of  compelling place to work ,  to shop ,  to invest ,  which was then combined with three slogans: passion for the customer ,  our people add value ,  and performance leadership 


-  It also fell on deaf ears ,  for the line employees had completely different mind-sets 


-  When  large sample of employees was asked what they were paid to do every day ,  the answer was most likely ,  I get paid to protect the assets of the company 


-  But how could managers shift the mind-sets toward making Sears  compelling place to shop? ,  To help employees understand their proper role in the bigger picture ,  Sears managers prepared learning maps ,  which teams of employees discussed at town hall meetings 


- 12  (  learning map is  large picture of  town ,  store ,  or river that leads participants through  business or historical process 


-  )  One map portrayed the shifts in the retail environment and the proliferation of competitors between 1950 and 1990 


-  Another map analyzed the sources and uses of funds as they flowed from the cash register to the bottom line 


-  Sears managers then asked the teams to apply what they had learned and recommend actions they could take immediately at their store ,  warehouse ,  or office to improve customer service or simplify their activities 


-  The strong signal was that front-line employees would have more autonomy to do right by the customer  and help Sears win in an increasingly competitive retail market 


-  ,  Eurotunnel management also used  team approach to overcome their employees suspicions that the change program was mainly concerned with cutting costs and get them to focus on their contributions to improving operations and satisfying customers 


-  At the peak of the change activity ,  almost one-third of the  , 000 employees were participating in one of eighty-seven multifunctional teams 


-  Many of the teams that addressed the needs of  customer segment included  particular type of customer ,  such as  truck owner 


-  The vision and all the connecting elements of processes ,  systems ,  and roles were communicated in dozens of meetings ,  newsletters ,  and  large wall chart that showed each teams position 


-  ,  Do the sponsors of the change  


-  ,  Companies need an effective management team to mobilize commitment for change efforts 


-  This team can be drawn together from mavericks inside the firm or  often more effective in  crisis situation  from outsiders with fresh perspectives 


-  Wherever the members come from ,  the organization needs to establish  team with the experience and credibility to mobilize the entire organization 


-  ,   popular but generally ineffectual method for instilling  market orientation is to create  council or steering group 


-  Firms that think they should do something but arent quite ready for deep-seated change often resort to these 


-  Commonly ,  their charter is to elevate skills ,  share best practices ,  or understand what it means to be market-driven 


-  As they are implemented in many organizations ,  these groups have little chance of success 


-  With as many as thirty or forty people and shifting membership ,  they are too large for real work and have little continuity 


-  ,  Resources are usually limited  perhaps  staff person and  modest budget  and members time commitment is very limited 


-  When Monsanto created  council to drive the company toward  best of class market orientation ,  it established  small leadership team of ten vice presidents and general managers that had  mandate to change basic behaviors ,  build market-driven capabilities ,  and transfer best practices 


-  The team was expected to spend at least 30 percent of its time on this effort and agreed to partially tie compensation to the results 


-  The council had all the resources it needed ,  including  full-time director of marketing core capability 


-  It met at least two times  week and focused on only  few big issues  such as relationship management  that would have the greatest leverage in changing  culture that was very technology-driven 


-  ,   company in as deep  hole as Sears or Owens Corning needs more drastic measures 


-  No amount of councils ,  consultants ,  and conferences will yield fundamental ,  durable change 


-  For  serious effort ,   new management team is needed ,  because the old one is likely short of credibility ,  energy ,  and imagination 


-  Sometimes the right people are in the organization but difficult to identify 


-  Often they have the right instincts and probably agitate for change but are frustrated in their crusade 


-  They have the advantage of knowing the prevailing culture 


-  But can they escape its deeply embedded values and assumptions to envision  more open ,  externally oriented culture ,  and then orchestrate  change effort? Sometimes the agitators for change lack credibility and respect because they have been operating at the periphery of the organization; they should act as consultants but not lead the change initiative 


-  ,  Martinez was able to change Sears because most new appointees on the senior executive team had no experience in retailing 


-  The head of marketing had extensive experience in brand management with Pepsi and Procter  Gamble and saw that Sears strong brands had much more potential for building loyalty than the company appreciated 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  organizations often treat outsiders like foreign antibodies and reject them 


-  This is  particularly common fate of successful marketing people who have been brought in from powerhouse marketing companies like Procter  Gamble ,  American Express ,  or Coke to lead the change effort in an established firm in  very different industry  perhaps one that is deregulating like banking or telecommunications 


-  They face two problems at the outset; they dont understand the technology ,  customer requirements ,  or key success factors in the new business ,  and they are separated from most of the support systems and cultural reinforcement that had made them successful 


-  ,  By this stage in the change program ,  enthusiasm should be high and the commitment of the top officers unquestioned 


-  Ideally ,  early success has quieted the skeptics and clarified the intent and benefits of  market orientation 


- 13 The most common obstacles ,  identified in surveys of managers and post-audits of failed efforts ,  are listed in the sidebar 


-  ,  Once the change initiative is under way ,   company turns its attention to institutionalizing it so the company doesnt revert to its old ways 


-  How can the company encourage and reward sustained market-driven behavior? The three most effective levers are organizational and process redesign ,  systems support ,  and incentives and rewards 


-  ,  Many firms have adopted hybrid organizational structures ,  with teams focused on managing distinct customer and consumer segment groups ,  for achieving closer alignment 


- 14 Each group that deals with customers must create  credible superior value proposition for its segment 


-  Eurotunnel used this lever to uncover the distinct needs of tourist travelers and business travelers as well as truck drivers and international trains 


-  Fidelity shifted responsibility for profits and customer retention from product managers to market segment managers 


-  Then product managers worked on new product and system developments that required deep technical expertise 


-  ,  Crucial to an organizational redesign is reengineering the core value development and delivery processes and realigning them with supporting processes such as human resources 


- 15 In 1994 and 1995 ,  IBM revamped its customer relationship management  ( CRM )  processes 


-  It began with  clear set of customer requirements ,   


-  ,  understand me and my business 


-  do business on my terms ,  that were translated into objectives for each of the ten supporting processes such as opportunity management ,  customer satisfaction management ,  and market management 


- 16 The pivotal process was market management based on the familiar sequence of analyzing markets ,  identifying and selecting segments ,  and devising strategies for each segment 


-  The output of this tidy process fed all the other processes  and thats where the trouble started 


-  For example ,  if IBM identified  new target segment ,  it had difficulty getting the human resources and training departments to pay attention ,  but ,  without their contribution ,  the right skills werent available 


-  The sales force was particularly resistant to changing its day-to-day activities 


-  Its mind-set was that all business is good ,  that all sales opportunities are good ,  and that all revenue is good 


-  This clashed directly with the emphasis on attractive opportunities in  market-relating capability rather than diffusing energies across high and low priorities 


-  ,  The best intentions of  market-driven change program will be thwarted if the compensation plan comes from another era 


- 17 If the change effort is to be taken seriously ,  the rewards and incentives have to be aligned 


-  Sears bases long-term executive compensation on nonfinancial as well as financial performance  one-third on employee measures ,  one-third on customer satisfaction and retention measures ,  and one-third on traditional investor measures 


-  Since this is such  powerful signal and motivator ,  it has been extended to nearly all field managers ,  whose annual incentive is now based on targeted improvements in customer satisfaction 


-  Even hourly associates can earn variable incentive pay based on improved customer satisfaction 


-  ,  It is impractical to focus an organization on the customers with the greatest life-time value or the most profitable segments or presume to offer seamless service with  hodgepodge of mismatched legacy systems 


-  This is why some of the biggest breakthroughs come from systems projects ,  and also why they are among the last steps in the process 


-  ,   centerpiece of the change process at Owens Corning was the realignment of systems to support its new strategy 


-  Customers would enter the Owens Corning system to find available inventory ,  determine their order-shipping date ,  and pay electronically ,  so that the multiplicity of products became  coherent bundle 


-  Owens Corning replaced all systems with SAP ,  the powerful ,  notoriously difficult enterprise software 


-  But old systems and procedures couldnt simply be replicated on the new systems; they all had to be completely redesigned to mesh with the new processes that flowed information rather than leaving it in separate silos 


-  After paying $110 million to install SAP and train people ,  the company expects to save as much as $80 million annually by 2000 


-  More important ,  it has aligned and integrated external information flows and internal processes and information 


-  ,  Systems changes are closely associated with process redesign 


-  Fidelity changed its approach to customer development and retention with  new process that enabled it to evolve from multiple service platforms  ( that couldnt share customer data )  to  single platform 


-  It changed its standard service for all customers to segmented service  ( for example ,  calls routed to representatives depending on the attractiveness of the caller )  


-  And it changed from product cross-selling to relationship development by targeting high potential customers 


-  ,  Do those responsible for change  


-  ,  Companies beset with day-to-day internal concerns often backslide after their initial success at becoming more market-driven 


-  Managers need to sustain the change process and drive the organization to higher levels of market orientation in  process called painting the bridge  ( as the painters of large bridges who finish their job at one end immediately start over )  


-  They need to continuously disseminate best practices ,  measure and assess progress  ( and assess the metrics used for measuring )  ,  and focus attention on the process 


-  Most successful change initiatives begin with an early ,  visible win that the company can celebrate and use as an example 


- 19 Eurotunnel pushed hard in the early stages of the change program to launch  club class for business travelers ,  which showed the benefits of working in multifunctional teams 


-  Pilot programs can also be used to fine-tune the change program and build enthusiasm 


-  During its regular Saturday morning merchandising meetings ,  the company celebrates managers outstanding achievements 


-   department manager in one store with  very effective approach might communicate her strategy to managers throughout the organization via satellite 


-  The managers can then immediately implement this best practice in their own stores 


-  ,   sustained effort requires ongoing monitoring of performance against objectives for improvement in important market metrics 


-  When Xerox launched its customer satisfaction program in 1990 ,  it set  target of 90 percent ratings of somewhat satisfied or very satisfied by 1992 


-  Then it changed the target measure to customer retention ,  which reenergized the program 


-  Whatever measure is used ,  it should be closely linked to financial performance ,  easily understood ,  and reliably measured so people have confidence in the results 


-  ,  Overall ,  managers need to focus attention on the change process to sustain it 


-  In addition to disseminating best practices and using measures ,  companies use continuous benchmarking against competition ,  frequent inputs from customers ,  and constant questioning of all processes to reinforce the effort to become market-driven 


-  ,  The stories of Fidelity Investments ,  Sears ,  Eurotunnel ,  and Owens Corning describe the unique path every organization follows to becoming more market-driven ,  shaped by its own past and competitive position 


-  While some companies are able to successfully design change programs ,  many others remain aspirants 


-  They believe that marginal changes ,   few management workshops ,  and proclamations of good intentions suffice when they should be mounting  fundamental change in their culture ,  capabilities ,  organization ,  and systems 


-  ,  The program to create  market-driven organization must begin quickly but be sustained over many years 


-  Fidelitys patience was rewarded with  large increase in customer-retention rates and  doubling in share of wallet within the first five years 


-  Results like this both justify the effort and sustain the change program 


-  These breakthroughs are akin to the S-curves of technology that characterize the life cycle of many industrial and consumer products: Introduction  Acceleration  Acceptance  Maturity 


-  Yet ,  within  relatively short time ,  the new approach becomes so widely accepted that it is difficult even for old-timers to reconstruct how the world looked before 


-  By the late 1970s ,  the array of strategic concepts  ( SWOT analysis ,  the five forces framework ,  experience curves ,  strategic portfolios ,  the concept of competitive advantage )  had become standard ordnance in the management arsenal 


-  ,  It is useful to step back and reflect on the scientific underpinnings to this legacy 


-  [Atoms] became the individual ,  force became the economists notion of marginal utility  ( or demand )  ,  kinetic energy became total expenditure 


-  All of this was synthesized into  coherent theory by Alfred Marshall  known as the theory of industrial organization 


-  ,  Marshalls work and its underpinnings in nineteenth century physics exert  huge influence on strategic thinking to this day 


-  From our concept of strategy to our efforts at organizational renewal ,  the deep logic is based on assumptions of deterministic cause and effect  (  


-  ,   billiard ball model of how competitors will respond to  strategic challenge or how employees will behave under  new incentive scheme )  


-  And all of this ,  consistent with Newtons initial conceptions ,  is assumed to take place in  world where time ,  space  (  


-  ,   particular industry structure or definition of  market )  ,  and dynamic equilibrium are accepted as reasonable underpinnings for the formulation of executive action 


-  Marshalls equilibrium model offered appropriate approximations for the dominant sectors of agriculture and manufacturing of his era and are still useful in many situations 


-  But these constructs run into difficulty in the far from equilibrium conditions found in todays service ,  technology ,  or communications-intensive businesses 


- com ,  Dell Computer ,  or CNN invade  market ,  they succeed despite what traditional strategic thinkers would write off as  long shot 


-  ,  During the 1980s and 1990s ,  performance improvement  (  


-  ,  total quality management ,  kaizen ,  just-intime ,  reengineering )  succeeded the strategic era 


-  Many are exhausted by the pace of change ,  and their harried attempts to execute new initiatives fall short of expectations 


-  To succeed ,  the next big idea must address the biggest challenge facing corporations today  namely ,  to dramatically improve the hit rate of strategic initiatives and attain the level of renewal necessary for successful execution 


-  Scientists use the term complex adaptive systems  ( complexity for short )  to label these theories 


-  But the work has identified principles that apply to many living things amoebae and ant colonies ,  beehives and bond traders ,  ecologies and economies ,  you and me 


-  ,  For an entity to qualify as  complex adaptive system ,  it must meet four tests 


-  Second ,  it continuously shuffles these building blocks and generates multiple levels of organization and structure 


-  Third ,  it is subject to the second law of thermodynamics ,  exhibiting entropy and winding down over time unless replenished with energy 


-  In this sense ,  complex adaptive systems are vulnerable to death 


-  Fourth ,   distinguishing characteristic ,  all complex adaptive systems exhibit  capacity for pattern recognition and employ this to anticipate the future and learn to recognize the anticipation of seasonal change 


-  ,  Many systems are complex but not adaptive  (  


-  But neither of these complex systems anticipates and learns 


-  Only living systems cope with their environment with  predictive model that anticipates and pro-acts 


-   group of distinguished scientists with backgrounds in particle physics ,  microbiology ,  archaeology ,  astrophysics ,  paleontology ,  zoology ,  botany ,  and economics were drawn together by similar questions 


-  These might be molecules ,  neurons ,   species ,  customers ,  members of  social system ,  or networks of corporations 


-  Further ,  these fundamental systems were continually organizing and reorganizing themselves ,  all flourishing in  boundary between rigidity and randomness and all occasionally forming larger structures through the clash of natural accommodation and competition 


-  Molecules form cells; neurons cluster into neural networks  ( or brains )  species form ecosystems; individuals form tribes or societies; consumers and corporations form economies 


-  These self-organizing structures give rise to emergent behavior  ( an example of which is the process whereby pre-biotic chemicals combined to form the extraordinary diversity of life on earth )  


-  Complexity science informs us about organization ,  stability ,  and change in social and natural systems 


-  It points to fundamental limits to our ability to understand ,  control ,  and manage the world ,  and the need for us to accept unpredictability and change 


-  ,  The science of complexity has yielded four bedrock principles relevant to the new strategic work: ,  Is complexity just interesting science ,  or does it represent something of great importance in thinking about strategic work? As these illustrations suggest ,  treating organizations as complex adaptive systems provides useful insight into the nature of strategic work 


-  In the following pages ,   will  (  )  briefly describe how the four bedrock principles of complexity occur in nature ,  and  (  )  demonstrate how they can be applied in  managerial context 


-  In particular ,   use the efforts underway at Royal Dutch/Shell to describe an extensive and pragmatic test of these ideas 


-  ,  The successes at Shell and other companies described here might be achieved with  more traditional mind-set  ( in much the same way as Newtons laws can be used to explain the mechanics of matter on earth with sufficient accuracy so as to not require the General Theory of Relativity )  


-  Deep theories reveal previously unsuspected aspects of reality that we dont see  ( the curvature of space-time in the case of relativity theory )  and thereby alter the fabric of reality 


-  This is the context for an article on complexity science and strategy 


-  Complexity makes the strategic challenge more understandable and the task of strategic renewal more accessible 


-  ,  An obscure but important law of cybernetics ,  the law of requisite variety ,  states: For any system to survive ,  it must cultivate variety in its internal controls 


-  If it fails to do so internally ,  it will fail to cope with variety successfully when it comes from an external source 


-  When  lightening strike and ill-timed winds created  conflagration that could not be contained ,  this carpet of dry material burned longer and hotter than normal 


-  By suppressing natural fires for close to 100 years ,  the park service had prevented the forest floor from being cleansed in  natural rhythm 


-  This is the price of enforced equilibrium 


-  ,  The seductive pull of equilibrium poses  constant danger to successful established companies 


-  Jim Cannavino ,   former IBM senior executive ,  provides an anecdote that speaks to the hazards of resisting change 


-  In 1993 ,  Cannavino was asked by IBMs new CEO ,  Lou Gerstner ,  to take  hard look at the strategic planning process 


-  Why had IBM so badly missed the mark? Cannavino dutifully examined the work product  library shelves filled with blue binders containing twenty years of forecasts ,  trends ,  and strategic analysis 


-  We saw it coming  PC open architecture ,  networking intelligence in microprocessors ,  higher margins in software and services than hardware; it was all there 


-  How did they reflect the shifts the strategists had projected? These blue volumes  ( three times as voluminous as the strategic plans )  could also be summarized in one sentence: Nothing changed 


-  And the final dose of arsenic to this diet of cyanide was the year-end financial reconciliation process 


-  When we rolled up the sector submissions into totals for the corporation ,  the growth opportunities never quite covered the erosion of market share 


-  This shortfall ,  of course ,  was the tip of an iceberg that would one day upend our strategy and our primary product  the IBM 360 mainframe 


-  But facing these fundamental trends would have precipitated  great deal of turmoil and instability 


-  ,  While equilibrium endangers living systems ,  it often wears the disguise of an attribute 


-  Equilibrium is concealed inside strong values or  coherent ,  close-knit social system ,  or within  companys well-synchronized operating system  ( often referred to as organizational fit )  


-  Vision ,  values ,  and organizational fit are double-edged swords 


-  ,  Species are inherently drawn toward the seeming oasis of stability and equilibrium  and the further they drift toward this destination ,  the less likely they are to adapt successfully when change is necessary 


-  So why dont all species drift into the thrall of equilibrium and die off? Two forces thwart equilibrium and promote instability:  (  )  the threat of death ,  and  (  )  the promise of sex 


-  ,  The Darwinian process ,  called selection pressures by natural scientists ,  imposes harsh consequences on species entrapped in equilibrium 


-  But from the vantage point of the larger ecological community ,  selection pressures enforce an ecological upgrade ,  insofar as mutations that survive offer  better fit with the new environment 


-  Natural selection exerts itself most aggressively during periods of radical change 


-  Few readers will have difficulty identifying these forces at work in industry today 


-  Nature hedges against this condition through the reproductive process 


-  Of the several means of reproduction that have evolved on the planet ,  sex is best 


-  It is decisively superior to parthenogenesis  ( the process by which most plants ,  worms ,  and  few mammals conceive offspring through self-induced combination of identical genetic material )  


- 10 ,  How does this relate to organizations? In organizations ,  people are the chromosomes ,  the genetic material that can create variety 


- 11 ,  Heres the rub: The exchanges of DNA attempted within social systems are not nearly as reliable as those driven by the mechanics of reproductive chemistry 


-  True ,  organizations can hire from the outside ,  bring seniors into frequent contact with iconoclasts from the ranks ,  or confront engineers and designers with disgruntled customers 


-  But the enemy of these methods is ,  of course ,  the existing social order ,  which ,  like the bodys immune defense system ,  seeks to neutralize ,  isolate ,  or destroy foreign invaders 


-  Antibodies in the form of social norms ,  corporate values ,  and orthodox beliefs nullify the advantages of diversity 


-  The numbing effects of tradition   staggering $130 billion in annual revenues ,  105 , 000 predominantly long-tenured employees ,  and global operations  left Shell vulnerable 


-  ,  Miller was appointed group managing director of Shells worldwide oil products business  ( known as Downstream )  ,  which accounts for $40 billion of revenues within the Shell Group 


-  During the previous two years ,  the company had been engaged in  program to transform the organization 


-  Yet the regimen of massive reorganization ,  traumatic downsizing ,  and senior management workshops accomplished little 


-  Shells earnings ,  while solid ,  were disappointing to financial analysts who expected more from the industrys largest competitor 


-  And the operating units at the coal face  ( Shells term for its front-line activities within the 130 countries where Downstream does business )  saw little more than business as usual 


-  The Downstream business accounted for 37 percent of Shells assets 


-  Among the businesses in the Shell Groups portfolio ,  Downstream faced the gravest competitive threats 


-  From 1992 to 1995 ,   full 50 percent of Shells retail revenues in France fell victim to the onslaught of the European hypermarkets;  similar pattern was emerging in the United Kingdom 


-  Elsewhere in the world ,  new competitors ,  global customers ,  and more savvy national oil companies were demanding  radically different approach to the marketplace 


-  Having observed Shells previous transformation efforts ,  Miller was convinced that it was essential to reach around the resistant bureaucracy and involve the front lines of the organization ,   formidable task given the sheer size of the operation 


-  In addition to Downstreams 61 , 000 full-time employees ,  Shells 47 , 000 filling stations employed hundreds of thousands ,  mostly part-time attendants and catered to more than 10 million customers every day 


-  In the language of complexity ,  Miller believed it necessary to tap the emergent properties of Shells enormous distribution system and shift the locus of strategic initiative to the front lines 


-  He saw this system as  fertile organism that needed encouragement to ,  in his words ,  send green shoots forth 


-  ,  In an effort to gain the organizations attention  (  


-  ,  disturb equilibrium )  ,  beginning in mid-1996 ,  Miller reallocated more than 50 percent of his calendar to work directly with front-line personnel 


-  Miller states: ,  Our Downstream business transformation program had bogged down largely because of the impasse between headquarters and the operating companies Shells term for its highly independent country operations 


-  But the forces for continuing in the old way were enormous and extended throughout the organization 


-  This had been part of our success formula 


-  Yet we were encountering  set of daunting competitive threats that transcended national boundaries 


-  Global customers like British Airways or Daimler Benz  wanted to deal with one Shell contact ,  not with  different Shell representative in every country in which they operate 


-  These problems begged for  new strategic approach in which the task at the top was to provide the framework and then unleash the regional and local levels to find  path that was best for their market and the corporation as  whole 


-  ,  Shell had tried to rationalize its assets through  well-engineered strategic response: directives were issued by the top and driven through the organization 


-  But country heads successfully thwarted consolidation under the banner of host-country objections to the threatened closing of their dedicated refining capacity 


-  Miller continues: We were equally unsuccessful at igniting  more imaginative approach toward the marketplace 


-  It was like the old game of telephone that we used to play when we were kids: youd whisper  message to the person next to you ,  and it goes around the circle 


-  By the time you get to the last person ,  it bears almost no resemblance to the message you started with 


-  Apply that to the 61 , 000 people in the Downstream business across the globe ,  and  knew our strategic aspirations could never penetrate through to the marketplace 


-  The linkages between directives given and actions taken are too problematic 


-  What made sense to Miller was to fundamentally alter the conversation and unleash the emergent possibilities 


-  Midway through the process ,  Miller became acquainted with core principles of living systems and adopted them as  framework to provide his organization with  context for renewal 


-  But the alternative wasnt centralization  it was  radical change in the responsiveness of the Downstream business to the dynamics of the marketplace  from top to bottom such that we could come together in appropriate groups ,  solve problems ,  and operate in  manner which transcended the old headquarters versus field schism 


-  What initially seemed like  huge conflict has gradually melted away ,   believe ,  because we stopped treating the Downstream business like  machine to be driven and began to regard it as  living system that needed to evolve 


-  ,  Millers solution was to cut through the organizations layers and barriers ,  put senior management in direct contact with the people at the grassroots level ,  foster strategic initiatives ,  create  new sense of urgency ,  and overwhelm the old order 


-  The first wave of initiatives spawned other initiatives 


-  In Malaysia ,  for example ,  Millers pilot efforts with four initiative teams  ( called action labs )  have proliferated to forty 


-  It worked ,  he states ,  because the people at the coal face usually know whats going on 


-  Once you give them the context ,  they can do  better job of spotting opportunities and stepping up to decisions 


-  In less than two years ,  weve seen astonishing progress in our retail business in some twenty-five countries 


-  This represents around 85 percent of our retail sales volume ,  and we have now begun to use this approach in our service organizations and lubricant business 


-  Results? By the end of 1997 ,  Shells operations in France had regained initiative and achieved double-digit growth and double-digit return on capital 


-  By the close of 1998 ,  approximately 10 , 000 Downstream employees have been involved in this effort with audited results  ( directly attributed to the program )  exceeding  $300 million contribution to Shells bottom line 


-  His lifetime fascination has been with the ordered process by which  fertilized egg unfolds into  newborn infant and later into an adult 


-  Modern computers use sequential instructions ,  whereas the genetic system exercises most of its instructions simultaneously 


-  For decades ,  scientists have sought to discover the governing mechanism that causes this simultaneous ,  nonlinear system to settle down and replicate  species 


- 13 ,  Kauffman built  simple simulation of  genetic system 


-  Since regulatory genes cause the cells  ( like bulbs )  to turn on or off ,  Kauffman arranged for his bulbs to do just that ,  each independently of the other 


-  His hypothesis was that no governing mechanism existed; rather ,  random and independent behavior would settle into patterns   view that was far from self-evident 


-  ,  on and off )  ,  multiplied by itself 100 times  (  


-  ,  When Kauffman switched the system on ,  the result was astonishing 


-  Instead of patterns of infinite variety ,  the system always settled down within  few minutes to  few more or less orderly states 


-  Similar phenomena hold true in business 


-  Mathematics has coined the term fractals to describe  set of simple equations that combine to form endless diversity 


-  Mountains ,  rivers ,  coastline vegetation ,  lungs ,  and circulatory systems are fractal ,  replicating  dominant pattern at several smaller levels of scale 


-  Fractals ,  in effect ,  act like genetic algorithms enabling  species to efficiently replicate essential functions 


-  ,  One consequence of emerging complexity is that you cannot see the end from the beginning 


-  While many can readily acknowledge natures propensity to self-organize and generate more complex levels ,  it is less comforting to put oneself at the mercy of this process with the foreknowledge that we cannot predict the shape that the future will take 


-  ,  Building on  (  )  the principles of complexity ,  (  )  the fractal-like properties of  business model developed by Columbia Universitys Larry Seldon , 17 and  (  )   second fractal-like process ,  the action labs ,  Steve Miller and his colleagues at Shell tapped into the intelligence in the trenches and channeled it into  tailored marketplace response 


-  The properties of self-organization and emergence make intuitive sense to me 


-  Seldons model gave us  sharp-edged tool to identify customer needs and markets and to develop our value proposition 


-  This ,  in effect ,  gave our troops the ammunition to shoot with  analytical distinctions to make the business case 


-  Yet the forecourt of every service station is an artery for commerce that any retailer would envy 


-  Our task was to tap the potential of that real estate ,  and we needed both the insight and the initiatives of our front-line troops to pull it off 


-  For  company as large as Shell ,  leadership cant drive these answers down from the top 


-  The first five-day workshop introduced tools for identifying and exploiting market opportunities 


-  Participants returned ready to apply the tools to achieve breakthroughs such as doubling net income in filling stations on the major north-south highways of Malaysia or tripling market share of bottled gas in South Africa 


-  ,  to lower fuel delivery costs )  was translated into key business activities  ( or KBAs )  


-  During the next sixty days ,  the first group of teams used the analytical tools to sample customers ,  identify segments ,  and develop  value proposition 


-  The group would then return to the workshop for  peer challenge tough give-and-take exchanges with other teams 


-  Then it would go back again for another sixty days to perfect  business plan 


-  At the close of the third workshop ,  each action lab spent three hours in the fishbowl with Miller and several of his direct reports ,  reviewing business plans ,  while the other teams observed the proceedings 


-  At the close of each session ,  plans were approved ,  rejected ,  amended 


-  Financial commitments were made in exchange for promised results 


-  ,  Week after week ,  team after team ,  continues Miller ,  my six direct reports and  and our internal coaches reached out and worked directly with  diverse cross-section of customers ,  dealers ,  shop stewards ,  and young and mid-level professionals 


-  Operating company CEOs ,  historically leery of any help from headquarters ,  saw their people return energized and armed with solid plans to beat the competition 


-  The grassroots employees who participated in the program got to touch and feel the new Shell   far more informal ,  give-and-take culture 


-  The conversation down in the ranks of the organization began to change 


-  Guerrilla leaders ,  historically resigned to Shells conventional way of doing things ,  stepped forward to champion ingenious marketplace innovations  ( such as the Coca-Cola Challenge in Malaysia   free Coke to any service-station customer who is not offered the full menu of forecourt services 


-  Many ,  if not most ,  of the ideas come from the lower ranks of our company who are in direct contact with the customer 


-   cant overstate how infectious the optimism and energy of these committed employees was for the many managers above them 


-  In  curious way ,  these front-line employees taught us to believe in ourselves again 


-  ,  As executives move up in organizations ,  they become removed from the work that goes on in the fields 


-  Directives from the top become increasingly abstract as executives tend to rely on mechanical cause-and-effect linkages to drive the business: strategic guidelines ,  head-count controls ,  operational expense targets ,  pay-for-performance incentives ,  and so forth 


-  These are the tie rods and pistons of social engineering  the old model of change 


-  Complexity theory does not discard these useful devices but it starts from  different place 


-  The living-systems approach begins with  focus on the intelligence in the nodes 


-  His design for emergence generated hundreds of informal connections between headquarters and the field ,  resembling the parallel networks of the nervous system to the brain 


-  ,  Nothing novel can emerge from systems with high degrees of order and stability  for example ,  crystals ,  incestuous communities ,  or regulated industries 


-  On the other hand ,  complete chaotic systems ,  such as stampedes ,  riots ,  rage ,  or the early years of the French Revolution ,  are too formless to coalesce 


-  ,  Historically , 19 science viewed change as moving from one equilibrium state  ( water )  to another  ( ice )  


-  Ecologists and economists similarly favored equilibrium conditions because neither observation nor modeling techniques could handle transition states 


-  The relatively inexpensive computational power of modern computers has changed all that 


-  ,  Phase transitions occur in the realm near chaos where  relatively small and isolated variation can produce huge effects 


-  Consider the example of lasers: while only  complex system and not an adaptive one ,  the infusion of energy into plasma excites  jumble of photons 


-  ,  Two factors determine the level of excitation in  system 


-  Living systems thrive when these mechanisms are in tension 


-  Business obituaries abound with examples of one or the other of these feedback systems gone amok 


-  At the opposite end ,  Value Jet thrives in an amplifying phase ,  adds more planes ,  departures ,  and staff without corresponding attention to the damping loop  ( operational controls ,  safety ,  reliability ,  and service standards )  


-  ,  Psychologists tell us that pain can cause us to change ,  and this is most likely to occur when we recontextualize pain as the means by which significant learning occurs 


-  When the great Austro-American economist Joseph Schumpeter described the essence of free-market economies as creative destruction ,  it could be interpreted as  characterization of the hazards near the edge of chaos 


-  Enduring competitive advantage entails disrupting what has been done in the past and creating  new future 


-  ,  Hewlett-Packards printer business was one of the most successful in its portfolio 


-  Observing  downward spiral of margins as many me too printers entered the market ,  HP reinvented its offering 


-  To maintain scale ,  HP abandoned its high-cost distribution system with  dedicated sales force ,  opting instead for mass channels ,  partnering ,  and outsourcing to lower manufacturing costs 


-  To protect margins ,  it targeted its forty biggest corporate customers and formed  partnership to deliver global business printing solutions whether through low-cost ,  on-premise equipment ,  or networked technology 


-  States Tim Mannon ,  president of HPs printer division: The biggest single threat to our business today is staying with  previously successful business model one year too long 


- 21 ,  Shell moved to the edge of chaos with  multi-pronged design that intensified stress on all members of the Shell system 


- 22 First ,  as noted ,  Miller and his top team performed major surgery on their calendars and reallocated approximately half their time to teaching and coaching wave after wave of country teams 


-  When the lowest levels of an organization were being trained ,  coached ,  and evaluated by those at the very top ,  it both inspired  and stressed everyone in the system  ( including mid-level bosses who were not present )  


-  Second ,  the design ,  as we have seen ,  sent teams back to collect real data for three periods of sixty days  ( interspersed with additional workshop sessions )  


-  Pressure to succeed and long hours both during the workshops and back in the country  ( where these individuals continued to carry their regular duties along with project work )  achieved the cultural unfreezing effects 


-  That may not sound revolutionary  but in our culture ,  it was very unusual for anyone lower in the organization to talk this directly to  managing director and his reports 


-  The first time were not consistent ,  were dead meat 


-  If we cover for people or praise everyone ,  what do we say when someone brings in an excellent plan? That kind of straight talk is another big culture change for Shell 


-  ,  The whole process creates complete transparency between the people at the coal face and me and my top management team 


-  At the end ,  these folks go back home and say ,  I just cut  deal with the managing director and his team to do these things 


-  It creates  personal connection ,  and it changes how we talk with each other and how we work with each other 


-  After that ,   can call up those folks anywhere in the world and talk in  very direct way because of this personal connectedness 


-  It has completely changed the dynamics of our operations 


-  ,  An important and distinct property of living systems is the tenuous connection between cause and effect 


-  As most seasoned managers know ,  the best-laid plans are often perverted through self-interest ,  misinterpretation ,  or lack of necessary skills to reach the intended goal 


-   cumulative total of $3 billion  ( in 1997 dollars )  has been spent during the past 100 years to underwrite bounty hunters ,  field  sophisticated array of traps ,  introduce novel morsels of poisoned bait ,  and interject genetic technology  ( to limit fertility of females )   all with the aim of protecting sheep and cattle ranchers from these wily predators 


-  ,  As the tale of the coyote suggests ,  living systems are difficult to direct because of these weak cause-and-effect linkages 


-  The best laid efforts by man to intervene in  system ,  to do it harm ,  or even to replicate it artificially almost always miss the mark 


-  The cause-and-effect formula seemed simple:  (  )  identify  region with major universities with strong departments in such fields as microelectronics ,  genetics ,  and nuclear medicine and having  geography with climate and amenities suitable to attract professionals ,  and  (  )  invest to stimulate  self-reinforcing community of interests 


-  The cause-and-effect relationships proved unclear 


- 23  lot depends on chance 


-  One is wiser to acknowledge the broad possibilities that flow from weak cause-and-effect linkages and the need to consider the second- and third-order effects of any bold intervention one is about to undertake 


-  ,  In todays fast-changing environment ,  Shells Steve Miller dismisses the companys old traditional approach as mechanistic 


-  Experimentation ,  rapid learning ,  and seizing the momentum of success is the better approach 


-  Today ,  if youre going to have  successful company ,  you have to recognize that the top cant possibly have all the answers 


-  ,  Change your approach to strategy ,  and you change the way  company runs 


-  The leader becomes  context setter ,  the designer of  learning experience not an authority figure with solutions 


-  Once the folks at the grassroots realize they own the problem ,  they also discover that they can help create and own the answers ,  and they get after it very quickly ,  very aggressively ,  and very creatively ,  with  lot more ideas than the old-style strategic direction could ever have prescribed from headquarters 


-  ,  A program like this is  high-risk proposition ,  because it goes counter to the way most senior executives spend their time 


-   spend 50 percent to 60 percent of my time at this ,  and there is no direct guarantee that what Im doing is going make something happen down the line 


-  Its about rigorous ,  well-taught marketing concepts ,  combined with  strong process design ,  that enable front-line employees to think like businesspeople 


-  Top executives and front-line employees learn to work together in partnership 


-   encountered lots of thinly veiled skepticism: Did your net income change from last quarter because of this change process? These challenges create anxiety 


-  Instead ,  top executives and lower-level employees learn to work together in partnership 


-  But the process and behavior that drive authentic strategic change arent like that 


-  If that evaluation comes up negative ,  youve got  big-time problem 


-  You dont have the same kind of control that traditional leadership is used to 


-  You get more feedback than before ,  you learn more than before ,  you know more through your own people about whats going on in the marketplace and with customers than before 


-  ,  Millers words testify to his reconciliation with the weak cause-and-effect linkages that exist in  living system 


-  When strategic work is accomplished through  design for emergence ,  it never assumes that  particular input will produce  particular output 


-  It is more akin to the study of subatomic particles in  bubble chamber 


-  The experimenters design creates probabilistic occurrences that take place within the domain of focus 


- The most influential contemporary strategic framework ,  espoused by Michael Porter ,  is based on two exclusive ways to compete: low cost or differentiation 


-   company can achieve low cost by aggressively reducing costs or differentiate by creating something that is perceived industrywide as unique 


-  Two companies illustrate this point: ,  Clearly ,  existing management frameworks do not address the challenges managers face today  ( see the sidebar )  


-  First ,  it defines strategic positions that reflect fundamentally new sources of profitability 


-  Third ,  it introduces adaptive processes with the capability to continually respond to an uncertain environment 


-  And ,  finally ,  it shows that granular metrics are the drivers of performance in complex industries 


-  ,  Our research gave rise to  new business model ,  the triangle ,  that better reflects the many ways to compete in the current economy  ( see Figure  )  


-  The new model fills  significant void in the development of strategic thinking by offering three potential options: best product ,  customer solutions ,  and system lock-in 


-  Its relevant economic drivers are centered on  product or service 


-   company can achieve cost leadership by aggressively pursuing economies of scale ,  product and process simplification ,  and significant product market share that allow it to exploit experience and learning effects 


-   company can differentiate by enhancing product attributes in  way that adds value for the customer 


-  It can achieve this differentiation through technology ,  brand image ,  additional features ,  or special services 


-  Every strategic option searches for  way to bond with the customer ,  which is reflected in  significant switching cost 


-  Through the best-product option ,  companies bond with customers through the intrinsic superiority of their product or service 


-  Important aids for this purpose are introducing products rapidly ,  being first to market ,  and establishing  so-called dominant design 


-  ,  The customer solutions strategic option is based on  wider offering of products and services that satisfies most if not all the customers needs 


-  The focus here is on the customers economics ,  rather than the products economics 


-   company might offer  broad bundle of products and services that is targeted and customized to  specific customers needs 


-  In that respect ,  the most relevant performance measurement of this option is customer market share 


-  Customer bonding ,  obtained through close proximity to the client ,  allows  company to anticipate needs and work jointly to develop new products 


-  Learning has  dual effect: the investment the customer makes in learning how to use  product or service can constitute  significant switching cost; learning about customer needs will increase the companys ability to satisfy his or her requirements 


-  Both have  positive impact in the final bonding relationship 


-  Often this strategic option calls for the development of partnerships and alliances ,  which could include other suppliers ,  competitors ,  and customers linked by their ability to complement  customer offering 


-  ,  The system lock-in strategic option has the widest possible scope 


-  Instead of narrowly focusing on the product or the customer ,  the company considers all the meaningful players in the system that contribute to the creation of economic value 


-  The company is particularly concerned with nurturing ,  attracting ,  and retaining so-called complementors ,  along with the normal industry participants 


-  (  complementor is not  competitor but  provider of products and services that enhance  companys offering 


-  The critical issue here is looking at the overall architecture of the system: How can  company gain complementors share in order to lock out competitors and lock in customers? The epitome of this position is achieving the de facto proprietary standard 


-  ,  Although ,  in reality ,  these options are not mutually exclusive ,  and  business could decide on  blended strategy ,  it is useful to consider the three alternatives as distinct ways of competing ,  with different scope ,  scale ,  and bonding  ( see Figure  )  


-  The scope significantly increases as we move from best product to system lock-in 


-  At the extreme end of the best-product position ,  where  company often opts for low cost ,  the scope is trimmed to  minimum 


-  The scope expands to include product features as  company moves to  differentiated best-product position 


-  It further expands beyond the product to include the customers activities in the case of customer solutions 


-  ,  The company finally reaches the broadest possible scope as  system lock-in company when it includes complementors 


-  ,  Scale is  critical strategic factor typically measured as product market share ,  which is appropriate when evaluating  best-product position 


-  In the case of customer solutions ,   company must consider its share of  customers purchases 


-  For  system lock-in position ,  complementor share is the most crucial consideration 


-  ,  Ultimately ,  bonding deals with the forces that link the product or service with the customer 


-  The customer solutions position achieves this through learning and customization 


-  In the system lock-in position ,  the utmost bonding mechanism is the proprietary standard ,  which is  fundamental force in driving profitability and sustainability 


-  ,  We can see the distinct nature of the three strategic positions by examining some companies that share the same outstanding business success but have achieved their high performance through strikingly different strategies and draw on fundamentally different sources of profitability  ( see Figure  )  


-  Its sales per employee are $560 , 000 per year ,  compared to an average $240 , 000 for the industry 


-  It has achieved this performance through  single-minded focus on product economics 


-  Nucors CEO John Correnti attributes 80 percent of its low-cost performance to  low-cost culture and only 20 percent to technology 


-  In fact ,  during Nucors boom years ,  between 1975 and 1986 ,  twenty-five of its minimill competitors were closed or sold 


-  Metrics reinforce this low-cost culture 


-  ,  Nucors financial performance resulting from this strategy is extraordinary 


-  Before new management took over Nucor in 1966 ,  the company was worth $13 million in market value 


-  Thirty-two years later ,  this management and the processes it employed took Nucor to $5 billion in market value or 35 percent compounded growth   spectacular result in the steel industry 


-  ,  Southwest Airlines is another example of phenomenal performance through  best-product strategy 


-  It relentlessly focuses on product economics and drives to cut product costs ,  sometimes reducing the scope and eliminating features from its service in the process 


-  It emphasizes shuttle flights that efficiently utilize an aircraft on repeated trips between two airports ,  rather than using the hubs and spokes of the full-service carriers 


-  It exclusively uses the Boeing 737 ,  rather than the diverse fleets of the established carriers ,  thus re-ducing the costs of maintenance and training 


-  ,  New companies may have an advantage over existing firms in originating radically new strategic positions founded on low cost because they may find it easier to redefine activities 


-  Existing firms have embedded systems ,  processes ,  and procedures that are often obstacles to change and normally carry  heavy cost infrastructure 


-  Many successful small companies have penetrated well-established industries and promptly reached  position of cost leadership in  more narrowly defined product segment ,  as in the cases of Nucor and Southwest ,  Dell and Gateway in personal computers ,  and WilTel in telecommunications 


-  All these companies have had the same pattern: they narrowed the scope of their offering relative to the incumbents ,  they eliminated some features of the product ,  and they collapsed the activities of the value chain by eliminating some and outsourcing others 


-  ,  This competitive position reflects  shift in strategic attention from product to customer  from product economics to customer economics and the customers experience 


-  ,  Electronic Data Systems  ( EDS )  is  clear example of  customer solutions provider 


-  EDS has achieved prominence in the data processing industry by singularly positioning itself as  firm that has no interest in individual hardware or software companies 


-  In the process ,  it has built  highly respected record by delivering cost-effective and tailor-made solutions to each customer 


-  EDS has completely changed the perception of how to manage IT resources 


-  While once IT was regarded as the brain of the company and every firm developed its own strong ,  internal IT group ,  now IT outsourcing is commonplace and even expected 


-  ,  As  customer solutions provider ,  EDS measures its success by how much it improves the customers bottom line or how it enhances the customers economics 


-  Typically ,  it goes into an organization that is currently spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually and delivers significant savings while ,  at the same time ,  enhancing the firms current IT capabilities 


-  EDS achieves these gains by extending the scope of its services to include activities previously performed by the customer 


-  By focusing on IT ,  operations scale ,  and experience relative to the customer ,  it can offer services at  lower cost and/or higher quality than the customers themselves can 


-  ,  MCI WorldCom provides  contrasting example of  customer solutions position 


-  Where EDS has built value by vertically expanding its service scope into activities previously performed by the customer ,  MCI WorldCom is an almost pure example of expanding horizontally across  range of related services for the targeted customer segment ,  or bundling 


-  It bundles the services together to reduce complexity for the customer 


-  The customer benefits from  single bill ,  one contact point for customer service and sales ,  and potentially  more integrated ,  highly utilized network ,  but the products are the same 


-  MCI WorldCom benefits through higher revenue per customer and longer customer retention ,  because it is harder to change vendors ,  and through lower cost customer service and sales 


-  It is shifting the dimension of competitive advantage from product share to customer share 


-  ,  Saturn ,  another example of the customer solutions position ,  is one of the most creative managerial initiatives in the past ten years 


-  It abandoned  focus on products and turned its attention to changing the customers full life-cycle experience 


-  Saturn deliberately decided to design  car that would produce  driving experience close to the Toyota Corolla or the Honda Civic 


-  ,  Instead ,  Saturn redefined the terms of engagement with the customer at the dealership 


-  Saturn offered extraordinary terms ,  which required  major commitment from the dealers to learn the Saturn culture and to make multimillion-dollar investments in the dealership 


-  ,  First ,  and not just symbolically ,  Saturn changed the name dealer ,  with the implicit connotation of negotiation and haggling ,  to retailer ,  which connotes loyalty and fairness 


-  In fact ,  the dealers educated customers on the features and price of the car and how they compared to competitors 


-  Saturn also established  complete rezoning and expansion of retailer areas ,  thus limiting competition and allowing for more effective use of  central warehouse that  circle of Saturn dealers could share to lower inventory and costs 


-  Saturn also implemented ,  for the first time ,   full car recall 


-  It replaced the complete car ,  not simply  component ,  and issued the recall within two weeks of finding symptoms of the problem 


-  ,  Not surprisingly ,  customer response was overwhelming ,  creating what has become  cult among Saturn owners and thus giving Saturn the highest customer satisfaction rating in the industry   phenomenal accomplishment for  car that retails for about one-fourth the price of luxury cars 


-  Saturns most powerful advertising campaign became the word of mouth from pleased customers ,  proving that focusing on the customer can be as strong  force in achieving competitive advantage as focusing on the product 


-  ,  In the system lock-in position are companies that can claim to own de facto standards in their industry 


-  These companies are the beneficiaries of the massive investments that other industry participants make to complement their product or service 


-  Eighty percent to 90 percent of the PC software applications are designed to work with Microsofts personal computer operating system  (  


-  ,  Windows 98 )  and with Intels microprocessor design  (  


-  As  customer ,  if you want access to the majority of the applications ,  you have to buy  Microsoft Windows operating system; 90 percent do 


-  As an applications software provider ,  if you want access to 90 percent of the market ,  you have to write your software to work with Microsoft Windows; most do 


-  ,  This is  virtuous feedback loop that accelerates ,  independent of the product around which it is spinning 


-  The same relationship supports the demand for Intels microprocessors 


-  Microsoft and Intel do not win on the basis of product cost ,  product differentiation ,  or  customer solution; they have system lock-in 


-  Apple Computer has long had the reputation of having  better operating system or  better product 


-  Motorola has frequently designed  faster microprocessor 


-  ,  Not every product or service can be  proprietary standard; there are opportunities only in certain parts of the industry architecture and only at certain times 


-  Microsoft ,  Intel ,  and Cisco have  shrewd ability to spot this potential in their respective fields and then relentlessly pursue the attainment ,  consolidation ,  and extension of system lock-in 


-  Some of the most spectacular value creation in recent history has resulted 


-  By 1998 ,  Microsoft had created $270 billion of market value in excess of the debt and equity investment in the company ,  Intel had created $160 billion ,  and Cisco had created $100 billion 


-  ,  In  nontechnology area ,  the Yellow Pages is one of the most widely recognized directories and most strongly held proprietary standards in the United States 


-  The business ,  which has massive 50 percent net margins ,  is  fundamentally simple business 


-  The Regional Bell Operating Companies ,  including Bell Atlantic ,  Ameritech ,  Bell South ,  and so on ,  owned the business and outsourced many of its activities ,  such as sales and book production 


-  In 1984 ,  when the Yellow Pages market opened for competition ,  there were many new entrants ,  including the companies that had provided the outsourcing services 


-  Experts predicted rapid loss of market share and declining margins 


-  Afterward ,  the incumbent providers retained 85 percent of the market ,  and their margins were unchanged 


-  How did this happen? ,  The Yellow Pages has tremendous system lock-in 


-  Businesses want to place their ads in  book with the most readership ,  and consumers want to use the book that has the most ads 


-  When new companies entered the market ,  they could distribute books to every household but could not guarantee usage 


-  Even with the steep 50 percent to 70 percent discounts the new books offered ,  businesses could not afford to discontinue their ads in the incumbent book with proven usage 


-  Despite enhancements like color maps and coupons ,  consumers found the new books with fewer and smaller ads to have more size advantage than utility and threw them out 


-  The virtuous circle could not be broken ,  and the existing books sustained their market position 


-  ,  Financial services are another industry in which standards have emerged and are  force in determining competitive success 


-  The key players in the credit card system are merchants ,  cards ,  consumers ,  and banks 


-  American Express was the dominant competitor early on ,  albeit with  charge card rather than  credit card 


-  Its strategy was to serve high-end business people ,  particularly those traveling abroad 


-  The well-known slogan ,  Dont leave home without it ,  and  worldwide array of American Express offices helped Amex achieve something close to  customer solutions position 


-  ,  In contrast ,  Visa and MasterCard designed an open system ,  available to all banks ,  and aggressively pursued all merchants ,  in part through lower merchant fees 


-  They created  virtuous loop  consumers prefer the cards accepted by the majority of the merchants ,  and merchants prefer the card held by the majority of the customers 


-  This strategy culminated in strong system lock-in and MasterCard and Visas achievement of  proprietary standard 


-  It is interesting to note that at this time ,  Microsoft ,  Intel ,  and Visa and MasterCard are all under threats of suits by the  


-  Excessive power can lead to alleged abuses that call the attention of regulatory agencies 


-  Banyan failed at achieving  de facto standard in the local area network operating system market ,  relative to Novell 


-  The right option for  firm depends on its particular circumstances 


-  ,  The three strategic positions are focused on three distinct economic perspectives  ( see Figure  )  


-  The average business performer reflects the average cost of the industry and the margin available to the average player 


-  In contrast are the low-cost competitor and the differentiated competitor; these two positions are the basic trade-offs represented in classic strategic positioning 


-  This is  strong competitive advantage because the efficiency of the cost structure allows pricing below the cost of the average competitor that ,  in the long run ,  might put the average performers out of business 


-  This is why the alternative to low cost must be differentiation ,  offering unique product attributes that the customer values and will pay  premium for 


-  The differentiated player could have  higher cost than the average performer while still enjoying  fairly high margin because of the inherent additional value of the product 


-  While the graph is simplistic ,  it represents important economic hurdles: to have  genuine low-cost position ,   company needs to demonstrate lower relative unit costs; to have the economic leverage of  differentiated product ,   company needs to show clearly that the customer will pay more ,  and that this premium is more than the added costs 


-  ,  By contrast ,  the customer solutions position  ( shown in Part  of Figure  )  centers on how products and services will impact the customer economics ,  either by lowering the customers internal costs or by allowing the customers to have higher revenue 


-  The customer solutions provider may have higher costs ,  but these are far outweighed by the economic contributions to the customer 


-  The economic hurdle here is to show measurable and positive impact on the customers profit 


-  ,  Finally ,  we can contrast the economics of the system lock-in position with the other alternatives by recognizing that the scope is further enlarged to encompass the total system of which products or services are part 


-  The economic hurdle is both to create additional value to the system as  whole through the heavy investment by complementors and then to be able to appropriate this value 


-  Part  in Figure  shows an average competitor whose complementors modestly add value to the over- all system 


-  In contrast ,  the owner of  proprietary standard has been able to get significant investments from its complementors ,  which adds value to its system 


-  At the same time ,  its ability to appropriate this added value is evident in its higher margins 


-  Bonding is  continuum that extends from the customers first loyalty to  product to full system lock-in with proprietary standards 


-  ,  In the first stage ,  dominant design ,  customers are attracted to  product because it uniquely excels in the dimensions they deeply care about 


-  If the strategic positioning is differentiation ,  the features or services that accompany the product could attract and retain the customer 


-  In an embryonic industry that does not yet have  defined product design ,  various competitors do enormous experimentation 


-  Product variety eventually consolidates to  common design that has the features and characteristics that customers expect from the product type 


-  ,  This emerging dominant design fills the requirements of many users for  particular product ,  although it may not exactly meet the requirements of any particular segment of the customer base 


-  In that regard ,  the dominant design is generic and standardized as opposed to customized 


-  The competitor generating this design captures the first element of loyalty from customers and has first-mover advantage 


-  For example ,  IBM benefited from  dominant design  the IBM PC 


-  Its format included  monitor ,   standard disk drive ,  the QWERTY keyboard ,  the Intel chip ,  open architecture ,  and the MS DOS operating system 


-  They came together to define the ideal PC for the market ,  which every other PC-compatible manufacturer would later have to emulate 


-  ,  Beyond the stage of dominant design ,  there are clear opportunities to achieve higher ,  more tangible switching costs on the part of the customer 


-  One such move is to enhance the products inherent characteristics by offering additional support that makes it more accessible and attractive and thus harder to switch from ,  thereby locking in the customer 


-  ,  Collateral assets ,  which the firm owns and which complement the core product ,  can be effective in achieving this goal 


-  Ownership of distribution channels ,  of specialized salesforces ,  and of technical support staff and ,  very importantly ,   brand-supporting image can significantly increase product function ,  make it more appealing to the customer ,  and make the whole package more difficult to imitate 


-  Brands as  collateral asset can reinforce lock-in when the product is unfamiliar and the functionality unknown ,  so that the assurance of support can dissipate doubts about product performance and encourage repeat purchase 


-  ,  National Starch ,   customer solutions company ,  provides an excellent example of customer lock-in 


-  However ,  it has an unsurpassed history of long-term superior performance ,  not only in its industry ,  but also compared to most  


-  The source of its success is its extraordinary technological capabilities coupled with an intimate knowledge of all its key customers 


-  R&D personnel ,  technical service staff ,  and marketing and sales managers have accumulated enormous knowledge on customer needs ,  the state of new product development ,  and ways to aid customers in revenue expansion and cost containment 


-  The essence of National Starchs business is  joint working relationship with the customer 


-  ,  One spectacular product that emerged from this relationship was  most sophisticated adhesive that eliminated welding airplane wings to an aircraft body 


-  The moral here is that by creatively constructing  tight working relationship with the customer ,   company can decommoditize  product 


-  The bonds are strong because the company is not only providing  product but embracing the customers own activities and enhancing its economics 


-  ,  Price structure can influence bonding with customers as well 


-  Two of the most innovative marketing programs in the 1980s were American Airlines Frequent Flyer program and MCIs Friends and Family promotion 


-  Both programs were widely acclaimed because they created some lock-in for traditional commodity businesses 


-  ,  Customized products and services can also lock in customers ,  through personalized services ,  customer care ,  and even billing 


-  In the consumer market for the financial services industry ,  Merrill Lynch first introduced customer management accounts ,  but Fidelity ,  Schwab ,  and other institutions followed 


-  The accounts are tailored to the users circumstances; characteristics of bill payment ,  brokerage ,  mutual fund investments ,  IRA accounts ,  credit cards ,  and checking accounts are specific to and chosen by the customer 


-  The effort to move this information to  new account creates  switching cost for the customer 


-  ,  Another benefit of close customer proximity is that the customer and the supplier bond over time 


-   newcomer finds it hard to break into  relationship that has developed mutual investments and benefits 


-  Additionally ,   product can create its own learning experience 


-  For example ,  once you learn how to use the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet application ,  there is  significant additional effort to switch to Microsoft Excel 


-  ,  There is  thin line between locking in customers and locking out competitors 


-  First ,  once  company acquires  customer ,  it is hard for that customer to switch to an alternative 


-  Second ,  significant barriers make it difficult for  competitor to imitate or to enter the business 


-  ,  Four forces contribute to competitor lock-out 


-  At the extreme end of the spectrum are channels that carry only one product ,  such as soda fountains that serve only one brand of soda 


-  If Coca-Cola captures the channel ,  Pepsi is preempted from that specific market and vice versa 


-  ,  In this environment ,  brands can also generate competitor lock-out 


-  They create customer demand that causes retailers to stock the branded product ,  at the expense of competitive products ,  given the physical constraints 


-  In turn ,  shelf presence further enhances demand and the brand because people can buy only the products available 


-  This reinforcing loop causes branding to be particularly effective for consolidating share and creating system lock-in when the industry structure includes physical distribution channels; this is in contrast to an industry that uses expandable channels such as telemarketing or direct mail 


-  ,  Another way to lock out competitors is to establish  continuous stream of new products that can result in self-obsolescence and create enormous barriers to imitation or entry 


-  Digital Equipment Corporations origins in the 1950s provide  good example of competitor lock-out in an embryonic industry 


-  As  result ,  competitors had difficulty passing  moving target 


-  Furthermore ,  DEC users had to develop tailor-made software applications 


-  The DEC architecture was not open; competitors thus not only had to match the technical features ,  but also had to be compatible with the existing software base 


-  In ten years ,  DEC became the second largest computer company in the world 


-  ,  Patents can lock competitors out ,  but also offer some challenges 


-  In the pharmaceutical industry ,   significant portion of  patents length is often consumed before the product is released because of the time required for trials and FDA approval 


-  Sometimes ,  half  patents life expires before the product is introduced 


-  In this situation ,  speed is key to competitive lock-out 


-  First ,  customer switching costs need to be high 


-  Second ,  it has to be difficult or expensive for  competitor to copy the product 


-  There are  number of ways to achieve system lock-in and to secure  proprietary standard 


-  While one might presume that this would be the dominant of the three positions in our business model ,  it is not always possible to develop  standard in every market segment 


-  ,  Managers can ask several questions to assess whether their company can achieve  proprietary standard: ,  By describing the three fundamental strategic positions ,  we have provided the mechanism to define the vision of  business  that elusive but indispensable requirement in successful management 


-  The first challenge is to construct distinct business options that respond to the new realities of the current environment 


-  More strategies fail because of ineffective execution than poor design 


-  More often than not ,   companys basic business processes are not aligned with the strategy 


-  During the past few years ,   proliferation of the so-called best business practices ,  including total quality management ,  business reengineering ,  continuous improvement ,  benchmarking ,  time-based competition ,  and lean production ,  have been primarily directed at improving  firms operational effectiveness 


-  ,  The Delta model starts with the selection of  distinctive strategic position and then calls for the integration of the collective processes ,  not of one individual business process such as operational effectiveness 


-  It is the balance of the fundamental processes that creates  unique and sustainable competitive position 


-  ,  Complexity and uncertainty in the market create  problem in implementing any plan 


-  The only assumption that remains valid over time is that the other assumptions will change 


-  Strategy needs to adapt continuously ,  and therefore implementation itself needs to respond to market changes and to an improved understanding of the market 


-  ,  In the Delta model ,  adaptive processes link strategy with execution by:  (  )  defining the key business processes that are the repository of the primary operational tasks ,  (  )  aligning their role with the desired strategic position ,  (  )  seeking  coherent integration across these processes to produce unifying action ,  and  (  )  incorporating responsive mechanisms as  core part of each process to ensure flexibility and change in an uncertain market 


-  ,  In the early 1990s ,   powerfully simple idea developed: businesses should be viewed not just in terms of functions ,  divisions ,  or products ,  but also as processes 


-  We have identified three fundamental processes that are always present and are the repository of key strategic tasks: ,  The triangle we discussed earlier is the motor that drives the selection of strategic positioning ,  which ,  in turn ,  defines the role of each adaptive process 


-  Consistency ,  congruency ,  and feedback are the guiding principles 


-  Not only does the role of each process need to adapt to each strategic option ,  but also the priorities with regard to each are affected 


-  Next we examine the role of each adaptive process in supporting each strategic position of the business  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  When operational effectiveness supports  best-product strategy ,  it is imperative to reduce the product costs by paying careful attention to the drivers of that cost 


-  However ,  in the case of customer solutions ,  operational effectiveness is also concerned with the horizontal linkages between products in the bundled offer 


-  The ultimate goal is to improve the customers economics ,  even if that sometimes raises the products costs 


-  The relevant cost focus is the combined impact on the customers business and the companys 


-  In the system lock-in strategy ,  the product cost is perhaps the least relevant among all the positions 


-  What is important is the value of the system through the creation of standards ,  the investments by the complementors ,  and their integration to improve overall performance 


-   customer solutions provider would look closely at the customers activities 


-  It would reduce the customers costs by adding equipment to diagnose  problem or perhaps by adding large-scale alternate backup systems 


-  In intranet services ,  in which  customer buys  highly secure private-line network using Internet protocols ,   company might attempt  system lock-in position 


-  Customers may find it increasingly expensive to switch or split vendors as they add applications and geographic locations to the same secure intranet 


-  Establishing  low-cost infrastructure is less important than encouraging the customer to install more sites and to use more applications that run on an intranet platform 


-  ,  When supporting  customer solutions position ,  companies seek to target key customers by offering  bundled solution ,  either alone or through alliances 


-  This often requires targeting vertical markets and resorting to customized products as appropriate 


-  ,  Channel ownership itself becomes an issue ,  in order to gain greater knowledge and access to the customer 


-  For instance ,  in 1993 ,  Merck ,   leading research-based pharmaceutical company ,  acquired Medco ,   premier distributor of generic drugs 


-  This allowed Merck to obtain the leading mail-order catalog ,  have access to unique distribution ,  and gain ownership of  customer database covering patients ,  physicians ,  and proprietary formulary 


-  ,  When locking in  system ,  the key customer targets are the complementors ,  so the company can consolidate the lock-in position and neutralize competitors actions 


-  In short ,  the targeted customer is fundamentally different in these three options 


-  At times ,  the final consumer or product user ,  although important ,  is not the critical strategic target 


-  For example ,  we all know that its customers do not universally love Microsoft 


-  The power of the owner of the systems standards gives the end user few choices 


-  ,  In the software industry ,  software game providers typically adhere to  best-product strategic position and target customers as  way to get access to as many customers as possible 


-  American Management Systems ,  which has  customer solutions position ,  implements customized software and thus targets vertical markets 


-  Novell ,  which has  system lock-in position ,  has the proprietary standard for LAN operating systems and needs to put its premium effort into attracting and serving both application developers and the 30 , 000 value-added resellers that distribute and customize NetWare 


-  ,  When it comes to supporting  best-product strategy ,  renewal of the business is seen in terms of securing  continuous stream of products ,  often by sharing  common platform 


-  If truly successful ,  that innovation will lead to establishment of  dominant design that represents the strongest base for competitive advantage with  best-product strategy 


-  In the case of the customer solutions strategy ,  innovation plays an important role through the successful development of joint products with key customers 


-  In this respect ,  this adaptive process is central not only for developing future customers ,  but for maintaining current ones 


-  Furthermore ,  the customer is the primary source of innovation ,  not the conventional R&D labs 


-  ,  The role of innovation in system lock-in is perhaps more critical than in any other strategic option 


-  Often the technology is responsible for designing the architecture that will generate the system standard ,  that will allow the ownership of that standard ,  and that will preclude the standard from being copied or becoming obsolete 


-  This segment has been characterized by short product life cycles and declining prices 


-  To succeed ,  every one to two years these companies develop new chips ,  which employ technology four times better than the previous generation ,  in facilities that cost more than $1 billion to construct 


-  These two companies have chosen the best-product position and pursue innovation to support their competitive advantage 


-  ,  Motorolas semiconductor business follows  customer solutions strategy that focuses on the automobile industry ,  among others 


-  The BMW 740 has fifty microprocessors that control many aspects of its functionality and are critical to its differentiation 


-  ,  As  system lock-in provider ,  Intel depends on the rapid development of  complex standard 


-  It developed five microprocessors ,  from the 8086 to the Pentium ,  from 1978 to 1996 


-  Second ,  having secured the standard ,  it has the luxury of occasionally incorporating  larger part of the system into its standard to enhance its features and to further extend the interfaces with applications 


-  There is  balancing act in grabbing additional functions from one complementor and in preserving the relationships and open architecture with other complementors ,  but  proven standard allows the freedom to do this 


-  ,  The concept of assigning priorities to the adaptive processes could be controversial 


-  Some might insist on giving equal importance to each process and argue for the criticality of simultaneously having low cost ,  excellent customer targeting ,  and superior innovation 


-  Choosing priorities does not dismiss one process or another but recognizes the intrinsic difference of each strategic position with its unavoidable ,  inherent trade-offs ,  Weve ranked the adaptive process priorities for each strategic option  ( see Figure  )  


-  The consistency corridor aligns the process of highest importance to each strategic position 


-  Accordingly ,  the best-product position needs the lowest cost infrastructure ,  which originates in the operational effectiveness process 


-  Second ,  it requires the support of  stream of new products to prolong its current vitality into the future ,  the innovation process 


-  Finally ,  the customer targeting process ensures the massive access to distribution channels 


-  ,  The customer solutions position has the effective targeting of the customer as its first priority 


-  Second ,  the operational effectiveness process ensures the delivery of the products and services to improve the customer economics 


-  Innovation has the third ranking ,  not because it is unimportant for joint product development with the customer ,  but because the customer solutions position does not necessarily require leadership in new products ,  services ,  and features relative to that called for in the other strategic positions 


-  Often the new product capabilities to support this strategy originate through alliances and the close collaboration with the customer 


-  ,  The system lock-in position has innovation as its leading adaptive process 


-  It contributes to the creation of the systems architecture that allows for standards to be conceived and owned 


-  The next level of support comes from targeting the systems complementors to consolidate the lock-in position and ,  quite significantly ,  the lock-out of competitors 


-  Finally ,  the operational effectiveness position is responsible for improving the system performance 


-  While this process is important ,  the two previous adaptive processes are more relevant 


-  ,  Feedback is  core attribute of the Delta model and addresses the additional problem in linking strategy with execution mentioned earlier  growing market uncertainties and the requirement for an adaptive strategy 


-  During implementation ,  managers need to monitor its performance and intended results and make corrections as needed 


-  As actions are tested and their merits or limitations become apparent ,  managers can understand more deeply the business issues they intend to solve 


-  ,  Feedback is an integral part of the processes 


-  For example ,  Capital One ,   leader in the credit card industry ,  strongly emphasizes customer targeting 


-  It has realized huge competitive advantage by recognizing that the credit card industry isnt one market ,  but millions 


-  The challenge is to identify these segments before the competition 


-  The lynchpin of Capital Ones customer targeting process is scientific trials ,  testing ,  and feedback 


-  At the beginning of the process ,  Capital One managers brainstorm offers ,  drawing from  broad range of sources ,  including intuition and research 


-  Next ,  they vary the core offer along the key dimensions  product ,  price ,  promotion ,  and channel  and identify  range of customer cells for test marketing 


-  Then they screen the results to select the offers with the highest profit or net present value in view of the full customer life cycle 


-  Capital One dissects profitability down to the smallest micro-segment ,  for example ,  types of customers ,  frequency of use ,  type of use  ( credit or transactions )  ,  bill paying ,  tenure ,  and costs of acquiring the customer 


-  Having the right data is clearly important because acquisition costs have risen from $40 to more than $200 per customer during the past ten years 


-  More importantly ,  information generated in the process yields hypotheses for other offers that may be more profitable 


-  Capital One designs  family of offers with the understanding that they will not necessarily be successful ,  but that they provide seeds for future success 


-  This approach contrasts starkly with the conventional trial ,  in which  company launches  test of one product variation to  nonsegmented group of customers 


-  When this fails ,  the company learns little in the process that can indicate  more successful variation 


-  It is  competence that extends well beyond credit cards and is applicable to many other products ,  such as cellular phones ,  installment loans ,  auto loans ,  mortgages ,  life insurance ,  and mutual funds 


-  ,  All three adaptive processes have common responsive mechanisms for obtaining feedback: ,  Metrics are fundamental to the Delta model; they chart the course for implementing the desired strategic position and are at the heart of adaptation 


-  Unfortunately ,  most business are limited in their ability to identify and track effective performance metrics ,  for two key reasons 


-  ,  First ,  metrics have heavily depended on financial and accounting data ,  which explain how the business has performed but provide little insight on future performance 


-  To anticipate the future ,  it is necessary to track performance against the adaptive processes ,  which are the initiatives enabling the strategy 


-  Figure  shows distinctly different metrics for each strategic position ,  according to the adaptive process 


-  Operational effectiveness goes well beyond the conventional role of ensuring  low-cost infrastructure for the delivery of products and services 


-  In the case of customer solutions ,  it also allows inquiry into the best way to add value to the customer by quantifying the economics of the value chain and how alternative products affect it 


-  Moreover ,  in  system lock-in strategy ,  it also examines the total potential of the products system and how the system can contribute to product enhancement and profitability 


-  Likewise ,  customer targeting goes beyond the stereotype of customer identification and prioritization to get to the roots of customer profitability and the ability to appropriate system profits 


-  Finally ,  innovation is not simply  process of new product development but also  way to secure customer bonding and competitive lock-out 


-  However ,  our research shows that the inherent variability beneath the averages points to the root cause or fundamental drivers of cost ,  revenue ,  or profit 


-  Managing by averages leads to below-average performance 


-  ,  An example in the telecommunications industry illustrates the nature and value of granular metrics 


-  The highest cost order was more than ten times the lowest cost order 


-  It was not possible from the averages to know how well or poorly the company was fulfilling orders 


-  Among this telephone companys five locations ,  the unit cost was more than twice as high at some sites than at others 


-  These differences were driven by structural factors ,  such as the scale of the facilities or the density of the service area ,  and managerial factors ,  such as training ,  incentives ,  or practices 


-  ,  At one location ,  we dissected the interconnected activities such as order entry ,  design ,  facilities configuration ,  switch testing ,  and so on 


-  In 70 percent of the orders ,  each step proceeded flawlessly and resulted in on-time ,  low-cost delivery 


-  In the other 30 percent ,  the order failed in one or more steps and required expensive ,  time-consuming remedial attention 


-  The high-cost order path was ten times the cost of the low-cost path 


-  Some of the high costs were caused by the people involved and some by the particular facility 


-  Some groups consistently operated at three to five times the cost or speed of others 


-  By comparing the groups and their different work practices ,  training ,  experience ,  or incentives ,  we began to formulate specific ,  focused efforts to address the high pockets of cost 


-  In our research ,  the concentrations of cost became more pronounced and the solutions more focused 


-  Granular segmentation allows  company to focus ,  to measure ,  to learn ,  and to innovate 


-  ,  The same pattern was evident in profit performance 


-  Figure 10 shows  huge variation in profit margin by individual credit-card customers 


-  The customers were ranked from most to least profitable 


-  The top 10 percent of the customers contributed 99 percent of the business profits ,  the next 10 percent accounted for 43 percent of additional profits ,  and the next 16 percent of the customers added 25 percent more 


-  Only 36 percent of the customers contributed to profitability and collectively accounted for 167 percent of the business profits 


-  Unfortunately ,  the remaining 64 percent of the customers produced losses equivalent to 67 percent of the total profits 


-  ,  While many companies tend to dwell on one measure of customer attractiveness ,  we found that no one factor adequately explains the variation in customer profitability 


-   high-usage customer can be unprofitable due to low outstanding balances 


-  Given high acquisition costs ,   long-time customer can make  low-balance customer profitable 


-  The combination of all these factors ,  which seem to grow with the complexity of the business ,  leads to greater profit concentrations
