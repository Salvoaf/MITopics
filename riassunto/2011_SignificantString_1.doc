- When customers believe that  company has treated them badly ,  they may take public action aimed at hurting it 


-  Thus began nine months of running the companys customer service gauntlet 


-  ,  Frustrated ,  angered and feeling that hed exhausted all customer service options ,  Carroll wrote  song about his experience and also created  music video ,  which he posted on YouTube in mid-2009 


-  The lyrics included the verse I should have flown with someone else ,  or gone by car ,  because United breaks guitars 


-  ,  Admittedly ,  not every unhappy customer has the wish or the wherewithal to make such graphic statements for  mass audience ,  but online public complaining does happen every day in diverse forms and varying intensities 


-  The demand is great enough ,  in fact ,  that an array of third-party organizations offers preformatted online platforms for customers convenience 


- com )  ,  provide online environments in which customers can post their misadventures as well as compare notes with other people 


-  Given these and other Internet options ,  companies whose unhappy customers decide to take revenge can suffer serious consequences 


-  )  The two rows of this matrix reflect our understanding of the behaviors of online complainers  ( Row  )  ,  which serves as the foundation of our recommendations for managing that behavior  ( Row  )  


-  ,  The matrix  ( read in  clockwise manner )  answers the following questions: ,  Quadrant 1: Why do customers complain online in the first place? ,  Quadrant 2: How long will online complainers hold  grudge against the company? ,  Quadrant 3: How should  company respond after the online complaint? ,  Quadrant 4: How can  company prevent online complaining? ,  In order to respond to or prevent online public complaining ,  one first needs to understand why customers pursue that course 


-  That is ,  what are the triggers? We find that customers go online because  (  )  they are victims of  double deviation and  (  )  they feel betrayed 


-  After this initial failure ,  customers attempts to resolve the issue  by complaining in-house to the companys customer service representatives ,  managers or owners  may also have come to naught from the customers point of view 


-  When such  sequence occurs ,  customers feel twice violated: First ,  the company deviated from acceptable practice ,  and then it deviated again by not satisfactorily addressing the problem 


-  Such double deviations can provoke ,  in effect ,   moment of truth for the customer ,  when the individual concludes that the company does not care about his or her patronage 


-  ,  That is good news for companies because online complainers are not necessarily terrorism-minded individuals who go online at the slightest provocation to impede commercial operations 


-  Instead ,  they are simply exhausted customers who kept complaining about  serious issue that the company kept failing to address 


-  Rather ,  we consider severe service failures that the customers simply cannot ignore and for which they need to achieve resolution  or ,  if all else fails ,  to go online in some dramatic fashion ,  as the  


-  ,  Betrayal  ( as Opposed to Mere Dissatisfaction )  Drives Online Complainers Not all customers who are victims of double deviations make online complaints 


-  What distinguishes those who do invest the requisite time and energy ,  knowing that their chances of material gain are limited? We find that they do so because they feel betrayed by the company  they believe that the product or service provider has violated the norms of  customer-company relationship 


-  In  double-deviation context ,  customers can see betrayal because they believe the company is morally obligated to help them resolve  difficulty that the company itself caused  (  


-  This sense of betrayal motivates customers to take all possible means to get even 


-  Indeed ,  when they feel betrayed ,  customers see online public action as justified  even noble ,  as it may ,  for example ,  provide warning to other customers 


-  ,  It is important to note that betrayal is not simply  case of extreme dissatisfaction 


-  Unlike dissatisfaction ,  betrayal is associated with anger ,  which is  strong negative emotion that motivates customers to respond strongly 


-  In contrast ,  dissatisfaction is related to frustration and annoyance ,  two relatively mild negative emotions that tend to be short-lived and result in more passive actions ,  if any at all ,  such as exiting the relationship 


-  But feelings of betrayal can lead customers to persist in their demands for reparation and ,  if that fails to satisfy ,  to engage in vengeful behaviors ,  such as online public complaining ,  against  company 


-  We found that after customers had complained online ,  their desire for revenge dropped in the succeeding four weeks and then stabilized ,  though never disappearing entirely  ( at least ,  not up to eight weeks after the complaint  the point at which we last surveyed them )  


-  Moreover ,  customers desire for avoidance rose after their online complaint and then remained essentially constant 


-  )  Thus ,  we found that customers do continue to hold  grudge: Although their desire for revenge diminishes ,  they are not coming back 


-  ,  Is  Post-Complaint Recovery Possible in an Online Context? But what if  company were to offer some kind of resolution ,  after the complaint had been posted online ,  to try to recover its relationship with the customer? In our survey ,  we found that 27% of the companies made just such  gesture 


-  Customers who received  satisfactory resolution within four weeks after their online complaint reported reductions in their desire for revenge; but resolution offered after that time frame had no impact 


-  It was too late! In any case ,  such  post-complaint recovery attempt did not seem to bring back the business of the online complainer; it had no significant effect ,  during any time frame ,  on the ex-customers desire for avoidance 


-  )  Thus ,  while  post-complaint recovery attempt may stop the vengeful actions of some complainers ,  as long as its done expeditiously ,  they are no more likely to return as customers 


-  ,  Do Certain Customers Hold Grudges for  Longer Time? Every company has its best customers  those who bring repeat business ,  show brand loyalty and in the extreme have strong emotional ties to the company 


-  Other customers  who may make purchases only once or sporadically ,  have lesser loyalty and have limited bonding with the company  we call casual customers 


-  ,  Does type of customer matter in the context of online public complaining? That is ,  do  companys best customers become its worst enemies ,  or are they more forgiving than casual customers? On the one hand ,  after  service failure the best customers may give the company the benefit of the doubt ,  perhaps feel grateful for prior service ,  or even expect to continue receiving good service in the future 


-  If so ,  they should be more motivated to forgive the company and might not hold  grudge over time 


-  On the other hand ,  because the best customers may expect special treatment ,  when they receive bad service instead they are more surprised and shocked 


-  Having felt entitled to more ,  when they dont get it they may feel betrayed all the more acutely 


-  ,  So ,  which is it: Are the best customers more forgiving or more vindictive? The data from our study are clear:  companys best customers are the most likely to become its worst enemies in an online context  at least ,  in the absence of  proper recovery attempt ,  about which we will have more to say below 


-  Compared with casual customers ,  the best customers feel more betrayed ,  which makes them much more persistent and vengeful in their complaining efforts 


-  And not only do the best customers maintain  greater desire for revenge over time ,  they also seek to exit their relationship with the company much sooner than do casual customers 


-  As in their other commercial activities ,  companies should be methodical when trying to recover their relationship with  customer after his or her online complaint 


-  That is ,  they should craft their recovery attempts by:  (  )  accounting for the type of customer  ( based on the prior relationship )   (  )  timing the response; and  (  )  carefully selecting the content of the apology 


-  ,  Tailoring the Response to the Customer The post-complaint recovery depends on the type of customer involved 


-  Our research shows that the best  ( relationship-focused )  customers are more amenable to recovery efforts ,  regardless of the recoverys size or monetary value ,  than are casual customers 


-  For the best customers ,  the companys admission of wrongdoing and the perceived sincerity of its apology could be more important than restitution 


-  In other words ,  for those steady customers who value  relationship with the company ,  recovery may take only  statement of contrition and  symbolic financial act ,  which communicate that the company values the relationship as well 


-  ,  Regardless of the content of the recovery ,  companies should pay special attention to their best customers because they not only are most amenable to sincere recovery attempts but also are generally the biggest spenders and feel most betrayed after  double deviation 


-  At the same time ,  companies dont want customers to feel that they are so big that they are indispensable 


-  One determinant of whether people will act on their desires for revenge is the power they believe they wield to exact such revenge and get away with it 


-  Therefore ,  it is important for managers to achieve balance  to make their best customers feel special without making them feel too special 


-  ,  For casual customers ,  the situation is different 


-  Instead ,  such customers typically care only about financial repayment ,  with the size of the monetary compensation being most important to them 


-  ,  These results suggest that companies responses should depend on what kind of customer experienced poor treatment 


-  First ,  companies should not expect that all of these customers are coming back; many are likely to be irretrievably going away 


-  Keep in mind ,  though ,  that getting avenging customers to go away can be good riddance ,  if not good short-term business 


-  Second ,  giving restitution to all customers who complain on the Internet could in the long run be counterproductive 


-  That is ,  if companies rewarded customers for complaining online ,  then eventually even more ,  not fewer ,  customers might do so 


-   major aim is to identify complainers who still are staying at the hotel and to have employees resolve the matter immediately ,  if possible ,  but at least before the guest checks out 


-  ,  What to Include in an Apology After the Online Complaint Common experience suggests ,  as do psychological and marketing research ,  that for most customers to feel betrayed following  service failure ,  and to become sufficiently angry to seek revenge ,  they have to blame the company for what has happened 


-  How much blame customers assign depends on their inferences regarding the nature of the companys service failure: Was the failure intentional and motivated by greed? Was the failure intentional but motivated by kindness? Or was the failure unintentional? Obviously ,  inferences of greed lead to more anger than do inferences of lack of motive ,  and inferences of kindness lead to even less anger 


- 10 As expected ,  participants who were presented with the negative motive had  significantly greater desire for revenge than for reconciliation ,  participants who were presented with no motive had nearly equal desires for revenge and reconciliation ,  and participants who were presented with the positive motive had  much lower desire for revenge than for reconciliation 


-  Further analysis of the experiments and  surveys results showed that inference of motive was the key belief that drove anger and any consequent desires for revenge or reconciliation 


-  ,  It thus makes sense that the apology should include  statement aimed at making customers worst-case inferences  ( of greed )  unlikely 


-  For instance ,  airlines apologies for delayed or canceled flights should include statements that explain the underlying motives 


-  Its not ,  say ,  that the airline wanted to combine two flights to the same destination because each one was less than half full  (  negative inference of greed )  it was concerned enough about  planes mechanical problem that it canceled the flight to keep passengers safe  (  positive inference of looking out for customers safety )  


-  ,  Note that simply providing no information about the reasons behind the failure does not help customers rule out worst-case inferences 


-  That is ,  in the absence of information ,  customers dont necessarily come to  neutral I dont know; they often connect dots that perhaps should not be connected and become convinced that the company is just plain greedy 


-  Dont allow customers to go down this road; give them an explanation instead 


-  ,  Other research on apologies suggests additional elements that need to be included 


-  Doing so can actually backfire ,  at least when its clear to the customer that the service failure was caused by the companys own negligence or incompetence 


-  ,  Basically ,  we advise companies to own up to honest mistakes when they make them and not to let the customer believe that they are motivated by greed 


-  ,  Even better is to respond so quickly after the initial service failure that the second element of the double deviation does not occur ,  with the result that most customers do not complain publicly and online 


-  Clearly ,  different customers often need to be handled differently 


-  For that reason we suggest that companies ,  in pursuing recovery processes ,  emulate the triage that doctors perform during medical emergencies involving multiple casualties 


-  Second ,  not all customers can be saved  that is ,  recovered  just as not all patients can be saved 


-  And third ,  some service failures ,  being more threatening to the customer and to the customer-company relationship ,  are more likely to motivate the customer to seek revenge against the company ,  just as some injuries are more severe than others and carry greater risks of suffering and death 


-  Companies should identify those customers who have suffered the most severe service failures and who can also be recovered 


-  Fortunately ,  such identification should be relatively easy ,  given that the most recoverable customers are typically  companys best customers 


-  Moreover ,  like severely injured patients who can be healed ,  these customers should be attended to very quickly 


-  More preventive still ,  perhaps ,  is  system in which customers may not mind service failures so much because they perceive  fair process for complaining about them 


-  In fact ,  the fair process effect   well-known psychological phenomenon ,  particularly in labor-management settings  demonstrates that employees will tolerate disappointing outcomes as long as they perceive the decision-making processes surrounding these outcomes to be fair 


-  In other words ,  for employees to become very angry and challenging ,  they have to believe that both the outcome and process are unfair 


-  Specifically ,  we have measured how the perception of fairness of the systems that companies put into place to address complaints  systems characterized by parameters such as voice ,  control ,  speed ,  waiting time and flexibility  can substantially reduce customers sense of betrayal 


-  Thus ,  as long as the company uses such fair processes ,  and as long as it makes customers aware of them ,  customers will tolerate the occasional service failure
