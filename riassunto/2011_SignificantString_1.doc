- Historically ,  most managers equated innovation primarily with the development of new products and new technologies 


-  But increasingly ,  innovation is seen as applying to the development of new service offerings ,  business models ,  pricing plans and routes to market ,  as well as new management practices 


-  There is now  greater recognition that novel ideas can transform any part of the value chain  and that products and services represent just the tip of the innovation iceberg 


-  For many large companies ,  in fact ,  the new imperative is to view innovation as an all the time ,  everywhere capability that harnesses the skills and imagination of employees at all levels 


-  )  However ,  the success rate of such approaches is mixed 


-  Employees face capacity ,  time and motivation issues around their participation 


-  And there is typically some level of disconnect between the priorities of those at the top and the efforts of those lower down in the organization 


-  )  In this article we focus on the key insights that emerged from our research ,  organized around five persistent myths that continue to haunt the innovation efforts of many companies 


-  ,  For many people ,  it is still the sudden flash of insight  think Archimedes in his bath or Newton below the apple tree  that defines the process of innovation 


-  According to this view ,  companies need to hire  bunch of insightful and contrarian thinkers ,  and provide them with  fertile environment ,  and lots of time and space ,  to come up with bright ideas 


-  If you think of innovation as  chain of linked activities  from generating new ideas through to commercializing them successfully  it is the latter stages of the process where ideas are being worked up and developed in detail that are the most time consuming 


-  Moreover ,  it is also the latter stages where problems occur 


-  On average ,  they indicated that they were relatively good at generating new ideas  ( either from inside or outside the boundaries of the company )  ,  but their performance dropped for every successive stage of the chain 


-  Such events are always valuable: They help to focus the efforts of  large number of people ,  they generate excitement and interest and they generate some useful ideas 


-  ,  But even with all these benefits ,  its not clear that ideation workshops are the right way to build companywide innovation capability 


-  As an analogy ,  think of the role that big musical festivals like Live Aid play in the alleviation of poverty 


-  These big events are terrific for raising awareness and money on  one-time basis ,  but the process of poverty alleviation takes years of hard effort on the part of aid organizations ,  and the outcomes are achieved long after the memory of the big event has faded 


-  The involvement of the general public in aid work usually ends with the check we write to Live Aid; but for the aid organization receiving the money ,  that is where the real work starts 


-  ,  Our research showed that most companies fail to think through the consequences of putting on ideation workshops 


-  The first problem is that they underestimate the amount of work that is needed after the workshop is completed 


-  UBS Investment Banks Idea Exchange ,  while conducted on  smaller scale ,  also involved  great deal of post-event work 


-  As one UBS manager observed: Preliminary sorting ,  then scoring and giving feedback on such  large number of ideas took  huge amount of time and effort by category owners and subject matter experts 


-  The ideas coming through were good ,  but if we are to do it again we need  repeatable ,  dashboard-style reporting system for quantifying results and keeping the momentum going 


-  ,  The second ,  and more insidious ,  problem with ideation workshops is that they can actually be disempowering if the organization lacks the capacity to act on the ideas generated 


-  We heard quite  few grumbles during the research from individuals who had put forward their bright ideas through  workshop or online forum ,  but received no response  not even an acknowledgment 


-  If the funnel is constricted further down ,  at the point where ideas get assessed and developed ,  stuffing new ideas at the top is simply going to exacerbate the problem 


-  ,  So what should you do? First ,  be very clear what problem you are trying to solve ,  and put on an ideation workshop only if you believe that it is  lack of ideas that is holding you back 


-  Second ,  if you believe that an ideation workshop is the right approach ,  be prepared to invest  lot of time and effort into the follow-up work 


-  It is sobering to note that successful innovation programs typically take many years to bear fruit: Procter  Gambles Connect  Develop initiative was piloted and developed over  10-year period ,  while Royal Dutch Shells Gamechanger initiative took more than five years to yield benefits 


-  Alas ,  many companies lack the continuity in leadership needed to make this type of long-term commitment 


-  ,  Takeaway: Most innovation efforts fail not because of  lack of bright ideas ,  but because of  lack of careful and thoughtful follow-up 


-  Smart companies know where the weakest links in their entire innovation value chain are ,  and they invest time in correcting those weaknesses rather than further reinforcing their strengths 


-  )  has had  dramatic impact on how we share ,  aggregate and interpret information 


-  The proliferation and growth of online communities such as Facebook and LinkedIn seduce us into assuming that these new means of social interaction will also transform the way we get things done at work 


-  For example ,  MyFootballClub is   


-  However ,  by 2010 its paying membership had dwindled to just 800 people ,  leading to severe financial difficulties for Ebbsfleet United 


-  Other online community initiatives fail to live up to their founders hopes 


-  For example ,  during the transition period before he came into office ,  President Obama endorsed the idea of an online Citizens Briefing Book for people to submit ideas to him 


-  could potentially be very valuable in helping large numbers of people get involved in an innovation process 


-  For example ,  IBM used space on its corporate Intranet to launch  72-hour Innovation Jam in 2006 ,  the purpose being to get IBM employees ,  clients and partners involved in an online debate about new business opportunities 


-   rather different example is Royal Bank of Scotlands development of  virtual innovation center in Second Life ,  which allowed the bank to prototype potential new banking environments and get direct and rapid feedback from employees around the world 


-  Both IBM and RBS had considerable success in attracting interest ,  but the overall story was much more mixed 


-  Some online forums really helped to galvanize their companys innovation efforts 


-  ,  What are the biggest problems with developing online innovation forums? The first is that the forum doesnt take off 


-  Its usually quite straightforward to get people to check out  new site once or twice ,  but they need  reason to keep coming back 


-   manager at Roche Diagnostics observed: Our hope that our internal technology-oriented people would gravitate to using this type of tool was completely unfounded 


-  We really had to push people  ( via an electronic marketing campaign )  to involve them in suggesting solutions to the six problems we identified 


-  One said: We probably underestimated the communications needed 


-  We had to counter some skepticism ,  to create the belief that something would happen 


-  Many of the ideas put forward were parochial or ill-informed ,  and few people took the trouble to build on the ideas of others 


-  ,  So what should you do to avoid these problems? The most important point is to understand the types of interaction that occur in online forums ,  so that you use them in the right way 


-  If you are looking for creative ,  never-heard-before ideas ,  and if you want people to take responsibility for building on one anothers ideas ,  then  face-to-face workshop is your best bet 


-  But if you are looking for  specific answer to  question ,  or if you want to generate  wide variety of views about some existing ideas ,  then an online forum can be highly efficient 


-  ( See Questions That Work  and Dont  in Online Innovation Forums for examples 


-  )  ,  Takeaway: Online forums are not  panacea for distributed innovation 


-  ,  Any discussion of innovation in large companies sooner or later turns to the issue of open innovation  the idea that companies should look for ways of tapping into and harnessing the ideas that lie beyond their formal boundaries 


-  For example ,  the Danish toymaker LEGO has been leveraging customer ideas as  source of innovation for years ,  and some new products are even labeled created by LEGO fans 


-  And one of P&Gs first experiments with online advertising invited people to make spoof movies of P&Gs Talking Stain TV ad and post them on YouTube  resulting in over 200 submissions ,  some of which proved good enough to air on TV 


-  ,  Our research confirmed that most large companies believe  more open approach to innovation is necessary ,  but it also underlined that there is no free lunch on offer 


-  The benefits of open innovation ,  in terms of providing  company with access to  vastly greater pool of ideas ,  are obvious 


-  But the costs are also considerable ,  including practical challenges in resolving intellectual property ownership issues ,  lack of trust on both sides of the fence and the operational costs involved in building an open innovation capability 


-  ,  Roche Diagnostics was  company that got  lot of value out of open innovation 


-  In 2009 it put in place an experimental initiative to overcome specific technological problems that were preventing certain R&D programs from moving forward 


-  The company identified six technology challenges that needed solving ,  and it opened the challenges up to the internal R&D community and to the external technology community through Innocentive and UTEK  ( now Innovaro )  ,  two well-known technology marketplaces 


-  The manager in charge of the initiative described the outcome thus: ,  Roches experience was the closest thing we saw to  proper experiment that compared the merits of tapping into internal and external communities  and it really highlighted the value of tapping into the external group 


-  But note that the potential respondents were being asked  very narrow ,  technology-specific question 


-  Clearly ,  the external community would have been far less useful for tackling company-specific or situation-specific problems 


-  ,  What are the downsides or limitations of open innovation? One set of concerns relates to how you handle intellectual property issues 


-  At the time of writing ,  Roche Diagnostics was still working through the details of the licensing agreement with the person who solved its technological problem ,  and the transaction and licensing costs were far from trivial 


-   related issue is that without the strong IP protection that  market-maker like Innocentive provides ,  external parties are careful with what they will share 


-  ,   second set of concerns was around how the companies we studied actually used the insights provided by external sources 


-  One European telecom company had  scouting unit in Silicon Valley to keep an eye on exciting new startups and emerging technologies ,  but the scouting team discovered that the only technologies the folks back in Europe were interested in were those that would help them accelerate their current development road map 


-  ,   final concern is simply the time it takes to do open innovation properly 


-  Companies such as Procter  Gamble ,  Intel and LEGO have put an enormous amount of investment into building their own external networks ,  and they are beginning to see  return ,  but you shouldnt underestimate the time and effort involved 


-  ,  Takeaway: External innovation forums have access to  broad range of expertise that makes them effective for solving narrow technological problems; internal innovation forums have less breadth but more understanding of context 


-  Smart companies use their external and internal experts for very different types of problems 


-   common refrain is that innovation involves discretionary effort on top of existing responsibilities ,  so we have to offer incentives so people to put in that extra effort 


-  The example of the venture capital industry was mentioned as  setting in which people coming up with ideas ,  and those backing them ,  all have the opportunity to become rich 


-  People are motivated by many factors ,  but extrinsic rewards such as money are usually secondary ,  hygiene-type factors 


-  More specifically ,  there is evidence from psychology research that individuals view the offer of reward for an enjoyable task as an attempt to control their behavior ,  which hence undermines their intrinsic task interest and creative performance 


- 10 ,  All of which suggests that you dont need monetary rewards for innovation 


-  With considerable upheaval at senior levels of the bank ,  the innovation movement was very much  grassroots effort  built around UBS Idea Exchange ,  an online tool 


-  We therefore involved people in presenting their ideas to senior management 


-  ,  The sentiment was echoed by the head of innovation at Mars Central Europe: We try to recognize people rather than offer material rewards 


-  We hold  corporate event ,  biannually ,  called Make The Difference ,  where ideas and success stories are celebrated 


-  ,  Takeaway: Rewarding people for their innovation efforts misses the point 


-  The process of innovating  of taking the initiative to come up with new solutions  is its own reward 


-  The reasoning here is straightforward: Top executives are not close enough to the action to be able to come up with or implement new ideas ,  so they need to push responsibility for innovation down into the organization 


-  Let  , 000 flowers bloom has long been the mantra of big successful innovators like 3M ,  Google and  


-  We wanted to find cases where dramatic changes had emerged through bottom-up initiatives 


-  There are plenty of examples of successful innovations that started out as below-the-radar initiatives ,  or as proposals that got rejected by top executives several times 


-  Examples that spring to mind include Ericssons mobile handset business ,  Sonys PlayStation and HPs printer business 


-  But ,  the point is ,  at some point all these innovation were picked up and then prioritized by top management 


-  Successful innovations ,  in other words ,  need both bottom-up and top-down effort ,  and very often the link is not made 


-  ,  During the research ,  we followed several cases of bottom-up innovation in considerable detail: UBSs Idea Exchange ,  Best Buys resilience initiative and GlaxoSmithKlines Spark program 


-  These initiatives were neither great successes nor outright failures 


-  They were able to demonstrate all sorts of modest successes ,  but they didnt have the impact that their proponents would have liked either 


-  ,  We discussed this issue in  workshop in late 2008 ,  and the story that emerged was interesting 


-  The company had put in place  range of tools: Some of these are top-down tools that are owned by senior executives; others are bottom-up tools that we put in place to get involvement from large numbers of people 


-  Then as costs increase ,  the idea goes to the innovation board ,  and if it is approved the board will fund  pilot project ,  which in turn helps the development of the business plan 


-  ,  The underlying point ,  he observed ,  is that successful innovation requires close attention to both facets: Weve learned that you only get the top-down working if you get the bottom-up right too 


-  ,  This interplay between direction and empowerment is evident even in  declared bottom-up innovator like Best Buy 


-  The success of the  


-  retailer is strongly tied to the cumulative effect of continuous experimentation and small bets at the level of individual stores 


- 12 Yet top management plays  significant role in channeling the collective creative energy toward desired areas by framing the innovation challenge in terms of finding new and better ways to service customers  ( dubbed the customer centric-cycle )   hence removing the risks of random or ill-focused innovation 


-  ,  One final aspect of the bottom-up process is how to deal with those whose ideas are turned down 


-  Broad-based innovation actually implies saying no to  lot of people ,  sometimes repeatedly 


-  Even when their own ideas are rejected ,  employees also note what happens to the successful ideas of colleagues  and companies should not underestimate the stimulus of seeing front-line innovators sometimes given the opportunity to implement the ideas they generated 


- 13 Once again ,  the interaction between bottom-up and top-down initiatives proves decisive 


-  ,  Takeaway: Bottom-up innovation efforts benefit from high levels of employee engagement; top-down innovation efforts benefit from direct alignment with the companys goals 


-  Smart companies use both approaches ,  and are adept at helping bottom-up innovation projects get the sponsorship they need to survive 


-  ,  Innovation is the lifeblood of any large organization ,  and many invest enormous amounts of time and effort in fostering distributed innovation programs 


-  technologies have made it possible to democratize the process even further ,  and offer ways of consolidating and evaluating radically new ideas 


-  ,  But there are no quick fixes ,  panaceas or one-size-fits-all solutions  not surprisingly ,  since by definition not everyone can be  successful leader in innovation 


-  ,  In this article we have taken an experience-led approach 


-  None is always right or always wrong 


-  The best approach involves careful judgment and  deep understanding of the particular challenges  company is facing 


-  By thinking through the pros and cons of each element ,  companies can manage their processes better
