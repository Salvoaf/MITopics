-  The burgeoning e-business literature bombards executives with ideas competing for their attention 


-  Moreover ,  e-business ideas are described in unfamiliar terminology  portals ,  infomediaries and aggregators in B2C/B2B/BTE settings 


-  ,   first step in confronting the challenges is to construct  coherent map of the e-opportunity 


-  With the mood swings of the financial markets and the faltering fortunes of New Economy icons ,  the business community at large still feels uncertainty about the future shape and scope of e-business 


-   comprehensive map of the e-opportunity and its three domains  ( operations ,  marketing and customer services )  can become  platform for exploring the new strategic landscape 


-  ,  Defining e-opportunity domains using  business-oriented perspective and language illuminates the role of new technology in competitive advantage 


-  In other words ,  successful e-strategies translate established strategic concepts into contexts in which they previously were not economically viable 


-  ,  Distinguishing between the three e-opportunity domains is critical 


-  Every business should be considering opportunities across all three domains ,  but the potential significance of each domain ,  and of individual ideas within it ,  will vary widely across businesses and industry sectors 


-  In research-based pharmaceutical companies ,  too ,  the information amassed through  products development process dictates the primacy of infrastructure ,  which must support discovery ,  trials ,  regulatory submission and product-advice activities 


-  There are three broad categories of e-marketing opportunity: ,  Although the full potential of those e-marketing-opportunity components is as boundless as marketing creativity ,  many success stories share features in common 


-  By contrast ,  providers of products perceived as having  low level of differentiation should select initiatives from the enhanced-customer-buying-experience and the enhanced-customer-usage-experience categories to create an overall positioning distinct from the competition: My basic product is no better/no worse than my competitors ,  but  provide the customer with additional value by 


-  ,  The quadrant of the e-marketing-opportunity model where high frequency of purchase meets low perceived product differentiation contains four marketing ideas ,  two from the enhanced-customer-buying-experience category and two from the enhanced-customer-usage-experience category 


-  As broadband access becomes the norm ,  the use of video will greatly increase the potential of customer input and benefit selling; the increasing availability of customer-activity information will support new ways of targeting customers 


-  ,  At first glance ,  it may seem that the e-marketing-opportunity model is narrowly prescriptive ,   mechanistic approach to  marketing strategy 


-  ,  E-service starts with  full understanding of customers needs across  given market space ,   rich and expert picture of what happens to customers in the space and what they are seeking to achieve 


-  Synthesizing that macro understanding with data on the history and status of individual customers can allow companies to give customers advice on their specific needs 


-  ,  An e-service business can bring together in real time the first two components of the e-service domain  ( understanding of customer needs; knowledge of all relevant providers )  to present customers with the best choices 


-  An e-business uses the software ,  then confirms that the option that meets the criteria best is indeed what the customer wants and electronically negotiates the closure of the deal 


-  ,  Because consideration of and insight into the customer context is the only route to selection and implementation of an e-service initiative ,  the appropriate framework for identifying the opportunity is the customer-service life cycle 


-  Unless the customer is unhappy at some point in the customer-service life cycle ,  it is unlikely that the opportunity for an e-service business will emerge 


-  Each company successfully targets  problematic stage in the customer-service life cycle and secures two vital benefits: the customer data that will assist in extending overall e-service and the resulting customer trust 


-  If another company  ( new or old )  seizes an e-opportunity ,  it will own the customer relationship 


-  ,  An analysis of e-opportunity is incomplete without  look at the potential for sustaining any competitive advantage gained by e-operations ,  e-marketing and e-service initiatives
