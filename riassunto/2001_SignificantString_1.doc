-  Vague hopes about bits for atoms and demassification are naive at best ,  echoes of talk about paperless offices 20 years ago 


-  Globalization is destroying the last remnants of stewardship for natural resources in industries such as forest products: Today ,  buy-and-sell decisions are executed by faceless agents living on the other side of the world from the people and ecosystems whose futures they decide 


-  According to the World Bank ,  the poorest quartile of humankind has seen its share of global income fall from  


- 25% over the past 25 years 


-  Individuals and small circles of friends carve out increasingly private lives amidst increasingly distrustful strangers ,  preferring to bowl alone 


-  National Academy of Sciences home secretary Peter Raven says ,  quoting the Wildlife Conservation Society's George Schaller ,  We cannot afford another century like the last one 


-  ,  Equally important ,  BP looks at the situation as  business opportunity 


-  Since 1997 ,  the company has become active in public forums on global climate ,  has begun to reduce emissions in exploration and production ,  has started to market cleaner fuels and has invested significantly in alternative sources of energy  ( such as photovoltaic power and hydrogen )  


-  All the while ,  Browne has led an effort to build  more performance-oriented culture ,  and company profits have been at an all-time high 


-  Appliance maker Electrolux uses water- and powder-based paints  ( rather than hazardous solvent-based paints )  ,  prioritizes the use of recycled materials ,  and has introduced the world's first family of refrigerators and freezers free of the chlorofluorocarbons that contribute to ozone depletion 


-  In 1999 ,  Toyota and Honda began selling hybrid cars that combine internal combustion and electric propulsion ,  perform comparably to competitors  and can achieve up to 70 miles per gallon today ,  with prospects for two to three times that mileage in  few years 


-  In 1998 ,  Xerox introduced its first fully digitized copier ,  the Document Centre 265 ,  which is more than 90% remanufacturable and 97% recyclable 


-  The product has only about 200 parts ,  an order of magnitude less than its predecessor 


-  According to Fortune ,  remanufacturing and waste reduction saved Xerox $250 million in 1998 


-  billion manufacturer of commercial carpet tiles ,  which saved about $140 million in sustainable waste reductions from 1995 to 1999 ,  are even rethinking their basic business model 


-  Interface's goal is to stop selling product altogether 


-  Nonetheless ,  business can play  legitimate leadership role as  catalyst for larger changes 


-  We believe that  new environmentalism is emerging ,  driven by innovation ,  not regulation  radical new technologies ,  products ,  processes and business models 


-  More and more businesses are recognizing the opportunities this creates 


-  Sustainability not only helps improve the world ,  but also energizes the company ,  says ABB's CEO Goran Lindahl 


-  ,  The good news is that change through market-driven innovation is the type of change our society understands best 


-  The problem is that much in today's business climate appears to run in the opposite direction 


-  Short-term financial pressures ,  the free-agent work force ,  dramatic opportunities to start new companies and get rich quickly ,  often cynical mass media ,  and industrializing countries aspiring to catch up to the industrialized world's consumption standards  these hardly seem like the conditions for increasing stewardship of the earth 


-  ,  The challenge today is to develop sustainable businesses that are compatible with the current economic reality 


-  Innovative business models and products must work financially ,  or it won't matter how good they are ecologically and socially 


-  To explore how to achieve this ,  the SoL Sustainability Consortium was formed to bring together like-minded corporate executives experienced in organizational learning who also see sustainability becoming  cornerstone of their business strategy 


-  Together ,  we are asking: Can organizations committed to sustainability work with the forces propelling most of the New Economy in the opposite direction? And ,  can organizational-learning principles and tools help in realizing the changes that this will require? ,  The first reality confronting businesses that are serious about sustainability is ambiguity ,  starting with the question: What do we mean by sustainability? The ambiguity inherent in sustainability has deep cultural roots 


-  In  sense ,  sustainability requires letting go of the story of the supremacy of the human in nature ,  the story that the natural world exists as mere resources to serve human progress 


-  But most of us grew up with this story ,  and it is still shared by the vast majority of modern society 


-  It is not easy to let it go ,  especially when we are uncertain about what the new story will be 


-  They have let go of  secure worldview without knowing what they can hang on to 


-  We are just beginning to explore what it means to be part of  universe that is alive  


-  Echoing Barry ,  Roger Saillant ,  former Ford executive and now Visteon vice president ,  says ,  The new story will have to do with personal accountability  


-  new communities in business and elsewhere based on knowing that there is no parent to take care of us and that we have  stewardship responsibility for future generations 


-  It has often been framed as environmentalists against business 


-  Only by embracing all three can we begin to understand what sustainability actually means 


-  This is what life-sciences writer Janine Benyus calls biomimicry ,  innovation inspired by understanding how living systems work 


-  Why should we expect businesses to violate the law of zero waste? ,  All living systems follow cycles: produce ,  recycle ,  regenerate 


-  ,  By contrast ,  industrial-age systems follow  linear flow of extract ,  produce ,  sell ,  use ,  discard  what Ecology of Commerce author Paul Hawken calls take-make-waste 


-  )  ,  Indeed ,  the primary output of today's production processes is waste 


-  Across all industries ,  less than 10% of everything extracted from the earth  ( by weight )  becomes usable products 


-  So ,  while businesses obsess over labor and financial capital efficiency ,  we have created possibly the most inefficient system of production in human history 


-  )  This implies three specific waste-reduction strategies: resource productivity ,  clean products ,  and remanufacturing ,  recycling and composting 


-  Remanufacturing and recycling  ( creating technical nutrients )  and designing more products that are biodegradable  ( creating natural nutrients )  reduce waste from discard 


-  They would do fewer things that compromise regeneration ,  such as paving over wetlands ,  and would invest some surpluses in restoring natural capital  for example ,  companies like Interface plant trees to match business miles traveled because increasing forest cover reduces greenhouse gases 


-  That is good in some ways ,  but troubling in others 


-  Indeed ,  most companies investing in cost-reducing ecoefficiency improvements are doing so with the aim of increased profits and growth 


-  In today's global capital markets ,  greater profits show up as investment capital that could easily be reinvested in old-style eco-inefficient industries 


-  Ecoefficiency gains are laudable but dangerously incomplete ,  as is any strategy that fails to consider the industrial-natural system as  whole 


-  Increased natural-resource productivity that translates directly into lower costs offers  compelling business case ,  one that does not challenge established thinking deeply 


-  However ,  focusing on ecoefficiency may distract companies from pursuing radically different products and business models  changes that require shifts in mental models ,  not just shifting attention within existing mental models 


-  The premise of work on learning organizations has been that thriving in today's knowledge-based marketplaces means reversing the destructiveness that Deming speaks about and cultivating people's drive to learn 


-  Already aware of the team's innovations in design for remanufacture  ( more than 500 patents came from the Lakes project )  and the product's success in the marketplace ,  we learned about how the team's zero-waste vision translated into  manufacturing facility with virtually no waste and eventually became embraced by many of the team's suppliers 


-  ,  Late in the day ,  Rhonda Staudt ,   young engineer who was one of the lead designers ,  was talking about the team's innovations when she was interrupted by David Berdish ,  veteran of many organizational-learning projects at Ford 


-  Rhonda ,  Berdish said ,  I understand what  great opportunity this was for you and how exciting it was 


-  What  mean is: What was the stand you took and who were you taking that stand for?  ,  Rhonda looked at David for  long time in silence and then ,  in front of many peers and  few superiors ,  began to cry 


-  ,  We have all spent much of our lives in institutions that force us to be someone we are not 


-  We commit ourselves to the company's agenda 


-  The poet David Whyte quotes an AT&T manager who wrote ,  Ten years ago ,   turned my face for  moment  


-  They want to increase imagination and creativity without unleashing the passion that comes from personal vision 


-  There is  difference between building more-sustainable enterprises because there is profit in it and because it is one's life's work 


-  ,  If understanding natural systems establishes the guiding ideas for sustainability innovations ,  then learning provides the means to translate ideas into accomplishments 


-  But ,  in fact ,  it is based on  different type of control 


-  It favors intangibles  ideas ,  information and relationships 


-  But he suggests that the real changes are not ultimately about technology but communication 


- 13 ,  Today ,  perhaps the earth as  living system is communicating to us through increasingly turbulent weather patterns 


-  Are we listening? If the New Economy is revolutionizing communication ,  can it enable deeper listening? If so ,  we may discern  new business logic emerging ,  one that starts with rethinking how firms create value and continues by redefining customers ,  employees ,  suppliers  and ultimately the company itself 


-  The traditional company produced something that it then had to sell 


-  Today ,  we must understand  customer and serve  genuine need 


-  ,  At the heart of the industrial-age growth machine was  kind of mass hypnosis  convincing consumers that happiness meant owning  new thing 


-  ,  What does it mean to create new business models on the basis of that understanding? For Interface ,  it means shifting from selling carpets to providing floor-covering services ,  automatically taking back worn carpet tiles or replacing entire sections if  customer wants  different color 


-  For Carrier ,  the world's leading manufacturer of air-conditioning equipment ,  it means renting cooling services rather than selling air conditioners 


-  For IKEA ,  according to its published mission statement ,  it means providing services to help people make  house or apartment into  home rather than selling furniture 


-  All these firms believe that higher profits will come from providing better solutions rather than selling more equipment ,  in the words of Natural Capitalism authors Amory and Hunter Lovins and Paul Hawken 


-  ,  From the standpoint of sustainability ,  providing services rather than just selling products creates  potential new alignment between what is sound economically and what is sound environmentally 


-   company's business model no longer requires designed-in obsolescence to push customers into buying new products 


-  Swiss industry analyst Walter Stahel and chemist Braungart have proposed that ,  in the future ,  producers will own what they produce forever and therefore will have strong incentives to design products to be disassembled and remanufactured or recycled ,  whichever is more economical 


-  ,  Such ideas signal  radical shift in business models ,  one that will not come easily 


-  It starts with how  company thinks of itself in relation to its customers: as  producer of things people buy or  provider of services through products made and remade? Marketing strategist Sandra Vandermerwe argues that such  view is essential to true customer focus ,  providing value for customers as well as obtaining value from customers 


-  As Volvo discovered years ago ,  when  company is only selling cars ,  its relationship with the customer ends with the purchase 


-  When it is providing customer satisfaction ,  it just begins 


-  Thirty years ago ,  futurist Alvin Toffler coined the term prosumer ,  people who actively participate in generating the value they derive from any product 


- 15 Today ,  prosumers are everywhere ,  says Kelly ,  from restaurants where you assemble your own dinner to medical self-care arenas ,  where you serve as doctor and patient 


-  As Kelly says ,  the essence of prosumerism today is that customers have  hand in the creation of the product 


- 16 ,  Prosumerism is infiltrating diverse marketplaces ,  especially those where Internet technology is strong 


-  The five-year-old magazine Fast Company now rivals Business Week ,  Fortune and Forbes ,  partly because of its Company of Friends ,   Web-site feature that allows subscribers to get together to discuss common concerns ,  form support networks for projects ,  or tell the magazine their interests 


-  I can go to our Web site and determine which are the 10 most frequently forwarded articles ,  says editor Alan Webber 


-  Ramaswamy ,  consumers have increasingly been engaging themselves in an active and explicit dialogue with manufacturers of products and services 


-  Or ,  as the popular Cluetrain Manifesto puts it ,  the market is becoming a community of discourse 


- 18 With the inmates running the asylum ,  will they start to change the rules? What if people start talking to one another? What if they talk about the state of the world and how different types of products affect the quality of people's lives? ,  Leading Web-based companies ,  because they relate to their customers differently ,  also gain  different sense of what truly concerns customers 


-  Without  doubt ,  sustainability of our current lifestyle  personally and environmentally  matters to  lot of our readers ,  says Webber 


-  These were among the concerns that motivated us to start the magazine ,  and we've seen nothing to persuade us otherwise 


-  Could this be another form of centralized control that becomes history ,  the victim of the freer flow of information and interaction that allows people to know more and learn faster? ,  Homo sapiens has been around longer than Homo consumer 


-  For  company that sells the image of fitness ,  it is not surprising that Darcy Winslow ,  general manager of sustainable products and services ,  says: Corporations in the 21st century cannot be fit if we don't prioritize and neutralize our impact on the environment 


-  ,  From Compliant Employees to Committed Members of Social Networks There are few companies today that do not struggle with the implications of the free-agent work force 


-  They offer stock 


-  ,  In 1991 ,  IKEA faced the daunting challenge of extending its European business success to North America ,  the graveyard of European retailers 


-  Achieving strong returns for  distant corporate office was not enough 


-  Being part of  proud and widely imitated European firm had limited meaning 


-  Eventually ,  some 20 , 000 IKEA employees in North America and Europe participated voluntarily in  two-day training session on The Natural Step ,  an intuitive introduction to the system conditions that must be met by  sustainable society 


-  Not only did that engage people in selling the company's environmentally oriented products and creating related product and service ideas ,  it engaged them in working for IKEA 


-  ,  The free-agent image connotes to many employers lack of commitment ,  people seeking  purely transactional relationship with  company 


-  In  very tough business environment ,  it really matters to people who have many options in their lives 


-  ,  Most industrial-age companies wanted what they regarded as committed employees 


-  Today ,  the definition of commitment is changing ,  and paternalism is giving way to more-adult relationships 


- People stay with  firm ,  in many instances ,  because they see an alignment between their personal values and those they perceive the firm to be committed to ,  says Ged Davis ,  who is Shell's vice president for global business environment 


-  If enterprises are not committed to anything beyond making money ,  why should managers be surprised that workers make transactional commitments? ,  Kelly also notes that in the competitive labor markets found in fast-growing industries ,  people change companies but maintain their loyalty to advancing technology or to the region 


-  One key person may take groups of people from employer to employer like the Pied Piper 


- 21 ,  From Separate Businesses to Ecological Communities The great benefits reaped by the New Economy in the coming decades ,  says Kelly ,  will be due in large part to exploring and exploiting the power of decentralized and autonomous networks ,  which in many ways now resemble an ecology of organisms ,  interlinked and coevolving ,  constantly in flux ,  deeply entangled ,  ever expanding at its edges 


-  ,  In traditional businesses ,  everything was piecework ,  says Zoho's Ho 


-  Now we are all part of larger systems ,  and our success depends on understanding those systems 


-  Today ,  cost may be only one of several criteria that shape successful producer-supplier relationships 


-  ,  Paradoxically ,  the realization that all enterprises are part of complex ,  evolving systems imparts new meaning to relationships and trust 


-  As Webber has said ,  The New Economy starts with technology and ends with trust 


-  That leads to the question: Can partners in complex supply networks co-innovate more-sustainable practices? ,  For example ,  Nike has programs in place with six of its material suppliers to collect 100% of their scrap and recycle it into the next round of products 


-  Similarly ,  all the big steps in design for remanufacture require intense cooperation up and down supply chains 


-  If you don't have suppliers hooked in ,  the whole thing will fail ,  says former Lakes chief engineer John Elter 


-  The Xerox team hosted supplier symposiums where we taught suppliers what remanufacturing means and gave them the basic tools for remanufacture ,  says Elter 


-  Even more important ,  they assured suppliers that they would share in the cost savings  because used parts would go back to the suppliers for remanufacture 


-  The key is that suppliers participate in the economic benefit of remanufacturing because they don't have to make everything new 


-  Without doubt ,  one of the biggest challenges with our Evergreen Service Contract [Interface's model for selling floor-covering services rather than carpeting] ,  says chairman Ray Anderson ,  is transforming mental models built up over generations  such as those of purchasing departments in big companies whose incentives are based purely on cost of purchase ,  rather than on lifetime costs and aesthetic benefits 


-  That is why the shift from seeing  world of suppliers and customers to one in which we are all part of larger systems is essential 


-  ,  From Closed Doors to Transparency The world in which key corporate decisions could be made behind closed doors is disappearing 


-  Despite the fact that the company had gone through  three-year process to identify the best environmental option and had the concurrence of the  


-  Shell had failed to realize that its private decision had become  public one ,   harsh lesson learned by many other companies ,  from Nike to Ford to Microsoft ,  in recent years 


-   The old world of corporate inner sanctums isolated managers from many of their decisions' social and environmental consequences ,  distant in time and space from those who made the decisions 


-  In this sense ,  transparency is  powerful ally to naturalism and may drive many of the changes needed to implement more-naturalistic ,  circular business processes and models 


-  Several years ago ,  Greenpeace objected to the chlorides IKEA used in the printing of catalogs 


-  But working together ,  Greenpeace and IKEA found  Finnish printing company that could produce catalogs without chlorides 


-  IKEA presented its chloride-free catalog at an environmental conference in Washington and set  new industry standard 


-  Shell and others are moving toward triple-bottom-line accounting  assessing economic ,  environmental and social performance in  balanced way 


-  But companies like Shell ,  Ford and many others feel they must do this if they want to lead ,  rather than just react to change 


-  The New York Times ignored most of the report  ( which included lengthy sections on reducing emissions and radical redesign of manufacturing processes )  to announce that Ford Is Conceding SUV Drawbacks 


- 23 The article focused on  three-page section of the 98-page report that discussed the dilemma of having  profitable product line that had environmental and safety problems 


-  The Wall Street Journal was more personal ,  suggesting that chairman William Clay Ford was  hypocrite for both making and criticizing SUVs ,   guilt-ridden rich kid who should either embrace his customers' preferences or leave the business to those who do 


-  Perhaps new collaborative action-research networks will create the right climate of objectivity and compassion ,  tough standards and fair reporting combined with  spirit of learning together 


-  )  Perhaps more-participative media ,  building on successful experiments such as those of Fast Company ,  will enable new levels of collaborative innovation 


-  Today's world of abundant financial capital and limited natural and social capital differs profoundly from the world of  century ago ,  when there was  need to protect individual investors 


-  In  world where learning and knowledge generation are the basis for corporate survival and wealth creation ,  managers must see  company as  living being ,   human community ,  says writer and former Shell executive Arie de Geus 


-  Yet ,  today's managers inherit  very different worldview ,  focused on the optimism of financial capital 


-  Is it not inconsistent to emphasize knowledge creation ,  on the one hand ,  and then treat  company as  machine for producing money ,  which is owned by its financial investors on the other? ,  Perhaps when we are able to rediscover company  ( from the Latin com-panis ,  sharing of bread )  as living community ,  we will also rediscover its place within the larger community of living systems where it rightfully resides 


-  ,  Creative engineers understand the role of constraints ,  says Elter of his Lakes experience 


-  The artist understands that rather than just being limits ,  constraints can be freeing ,  especially when those constraints that have genuine meaning are recognized 


-  What if product and business designers everywhere recognized that their constraints came from living systems? What if they adhered to the simple dictums: waste equals food; support nature's regenerative processes; live off energy income ,  not principal; and ,  borrowing from Elter's team ,  do it for the children 


-  It will come from everywhere and nowhere in particular
