- Business executives love to hate information technology ,  yet IT expenditures continue to increase 


-  At the same time ,  accounts of wasted investments make headlines ,  providing fuel for IT skeptics: An estimated 68% of corporate IT projects are neither on time nor on budget ,  and they dont deliver the originally stated business goals 


-  ,  Considering that IT budgets comprise hundreds or even thousands of projects running simultaneously across functions ,  business units and geographies ,  its  challenge to select projects for investment that are synchronized with corporate strategy 


-  Charged with managing such projects effectively ,  executives are asking ,  How do we maximize the business value from IT investments?2 ,  The answer may be IT portfolio management  ( ITPM )  that is ,  managing IT as  portfolio of assets similar to  financial portfolio and striving to improve the performance of the portfolio by balancing risk and return 


-  ,  Analogies that build on financial-portfolio theory or on concepts about product and research-and-development pipeline portfolios  ( which are more akin to IT portfolio management than to financial portfolios )  are not new 


-  ITPM has evolved into  combination of practices and techniques used to measure and increase the return on individual and aggregate technology investments  existing and planned  and to reduce risk 


-  An investment portfolio comprises all direct and indirect IT projects and assets ,  including infrastructure ,  outsourcing contracts and software licenses 


-  companies ,  we conducted research from November 2002 to March 2003 


-  The research  consisting of  survey of 130 Fortune 1000 chief information officers and in-depth interviews with selected respondents  measured ITPM adoption ,  identified implementation hurdles ,  assessed benefits ,  defined best practices and formulated strategies for success 


-  )  ,  Eighty-nine percent of the CIOs polled were very aware of ITPM ,  and 65% believed that the approach yields significant business value 


-  Nevertheless ,  only  few organizations  ( 17% )  appeared to be realizing ITPMs full value 


-  ,  Why dont executives adopt the practices they purportedly believe in? Why ,  for example ,  do 59% of companies regularly calculate the return on investment of IT projects before making an investment decision ,  but only 25% measure the realized ROI after  projects completion? Skills ,  attitudes and behaviors must change 


-  ,  Consider the success of Harrahs Entertainment Inc 


-  ,  the worlds largest gaming company 


-  When he was chief operating officer ,  Gary Loveman  now president and CEO  began collecting extensive data on small-scale gamblers in order to measure the success of promotions targeted to them 


-  Soon the rest of the casino industry found itself playing catch-up 


-  The model segments  companys IT portfolio management into four stages: ad hoc ,  defined ,  managed and synchronized 


-  ,  Companies at this stage make decisions about investments in an uncoordinated way 


-  For example ,  an IT audit of  major Fortune 500 investment bank found four customer-relationship-management  ( CRM )  projects under way in three divisions using software from different vendors 


-  Similarly ,   global property-and-casualty insurer found itself on the cusp of spending $10 million to implement software that was already in use 


-  When David Faith ,  senior vice president of the Enterprise Group at Scoular Co 


-  ,  which provides agricultural-industry services such as grain-elevator management ,  viewed IT spending from  portfolio perspective ,  he noticed the companys myriad fixed-line ,  wireless and videoconferencing contracts 


-  To tackle misperceptions about large-company IT ,  he engaged senior executives in  strategic dialogue about telecommunications needs ,  consolidated vendors and cut spending by 50% while simultaneously expanding network services 


-  ,  Today Scoulars process is at the synchronized level 


-  ,  Our research also uncovered another instance of the benefits of an ITPM approach: One particular global investment management firm used findings from  portfolio exercise to cut telecommunication costs by $30 million 


-  After being codified ,  project data are logged in  central database 


-  Having developed methods for evaluating and prioritizing investment proposals ,  the corporate IT department also has instituted central budget oversight and ,  most likely ,  maintains  central project-management office 


-  Pertinent IT personnel have  basic understanding of the financial metrics used to make investment decisions  the portfolio having been defined in terms of an initial set of agreed-upon facts 


-  Features missing at this level are consistency in organizationwide compliance ,  links into budgeting cycles and feedback loops to assess actual returns 


-  ,  Companies functioning at the defined stage often struggle to link the IT portfolio to business strategy because of  lack of common beliefs and standards 


-  As the CIO of  leading professional-services firm explained ,  My biggest challenge was at the lower levels ,  both from IT people as well as the business users 


-  IT people will do only whatever the users ask them to do ,  and then theyll complain about it 


-  ,  The CIO added ,  Last year we created  new spreadsheet for project proposals that looked at risk as well as reward 


-  Well ,  we found that our project managers look at risk and reward very differently 


-  ,  Companies functioning at the managed stage distinguish themselves from those at the defined stage by  standardized ITPM process that enables objective project selection and has  clear link with business strategy 


-  convenience-store chain and  large paper-products manufacturer 


-  Financial metrics ,  such as ROI and net present value  ( NPV )  ,  are consistently calculated and used in reviews with business leaders to align IT spending with strategy 


-  ,  The director of program management of  Blue Cross Blue Shield-affiliated company functioning at the managed stage reports that the portfolio process helps with project selection: The nature of our organization makes it hard to tie everything to an ROI 


-  So we use alternatives to measure the impact of IT investments ,  such as the time it takes our associates to access information when taking member service calls 


-  We also look at data from satisfaction surveys among our constituents 


-  Those analyses translate into benefits-realization reviews at the end of each project 


-  ,  The most savvy IT management teams distinguish themselves by their ability to align investment portfolios with business strategy 


-  And to increase the aggregate value of their IT investments ,  they assess both the risks associated with each project  ( delays ,  cost overruns ,  strategic misalignment ,  end-user acceptance )  and the portfolio risks  ( the blend of run the business innovation and breakthrough innovation )  


-  Synchronized companies also are disciplined about getting frequent feedback from business-unit heads and corporate-strategy vice presidents to ensure that IT efforts stay aligned with strategy after investments are decided on 


-  ,   Fortune 500 consumer packaged-goods company offers  relevant example 


-  All potential IT projects costing over  predetermined amount  often $250 , 000  go through  rigorous vetting process 


-  Required to have  valid business rationale with an NPV or internal rate of return  ( IRR )  calculation ,  each project is screened relative to the companys existing and planned infrastructure 


-  Then  cross-functional executive team evaluates each one using  Balanced Scorecard approach that captures the various dimensions of business value ,  risk and ability to succeed 


-  The enterprise has  process guide with detailed grading for each category on the scorecard ,  ensuring consistent scoring and optimal alignment with the organizations key business objectives 


-  Plotting projects on  matrix of value to the business vs 


-  risk helps companies such as this visualize the project portfolios viability 


-  )  ,  The consumer-goods company reported convening  senior management council  business-unit vice presidents plus the CFO and the CIO  to review projects 


-  Six criteria related to the 2002 strategic objectives were weighed: financial return ,  consumer focus ,  supply-chain business benefit ,  technology efficiency ,  knowledge advantage and work-life balance 


-  In 2002 ,  89% of the IT investments went to the top 50 firmwide projects vs 


-  There was better alignment and wider support from senior business management 


-  An interesting side effect: The CFO and business-unit heads ,  upon reviewing the portfolio of potential projects ,  increased overall IT spending to fund additional high-value projects 


-  ,  The more successful companies therefore link strategy to IT portfolio investments using  process similar to one first laid out in the late 1990s: Define the companywide strategic intent and business objectives; understand the strategic context of the company; develop business and IT objectives matched to corporate strategic objectives; develop an appropriate portfolio of business and IT investments to support the strategic business objective; and keep updating 


-  Says John Boushy ,  senior vice president of operations ,  Every project has  business case 


-  We ask ,  What is the business need? What does the business owner want the technology to do or the investment of information technology to provide? If it provides that ,  what are the business outcomes that will change? For example ,  what will change in terms of customer satisfaction? What will change in terms of increased revenues? What will change in terms of decreased costs? Then on the basis of the total cost of ownership of putting the investment in place ,  they ask ,  What is the increased support and infrastructure that might be required? Every project goes through such an analysis 


-  We track our scores by Gold ,  Platinum and Diamond Rewards customer-tier levels ,  segmented by predicted customer lifetime value ,  and we actually look at the customer satisfaction scores that occur as we implement  service-improvement initiative 


- com eTotal Rewards Web portal that lets customers see their personalized offers and update their account information online 


-  Says Boushy ,  Weve been able to quantify the value of increasing the satisfaction level of  customer from   to an A: It represents an annual increase in revenue of about 6% from that specific customer 


-  ,  Data analysis from the survey uncovered  statistical link between  synchronized ITPM process and return-on-asset  ( ROA )  performance 


-  The research involved multivariable regression analysis for responding companies 


-  The dependent performance variable was ROA ,  and the independent variables included such factors as IT spending as  percentage of revenue plus  special ITPM score 


-  For companies with large investments in IT ,   synchronized ITPM process appeared to impact ROA measurably ,  but simply defining and managing the ITPM process is not enough to improve performance significantly 


-  Qualitative data analysis of the interview transcripts revealed what the interviewees considered to be the top 10 benefits of ITPM 


-  The benefit valued most was improved business-strategy alignment 


-  Next came centralized control and ,  in descending order ,  cost reduction ,  communication with business executives ,  improved ROI ,  improved customer service ,  professional respect ,  competitive advantage ,  IT integration during mergers and acquisitions ,  and finally ,  improved decision making 


-  ,  Lynne Ellyn ,  senior vice president and CIO at DTE Energy ,   Michigan-based energy and energy-technology provider ,  described the benefits of ITPM: Our portfolio-management approach has been instrumental in cutting costs by 40% over the last two years and increasing productivity 


-  We have developed strong application-development and project-management skills 


-  We are training other parts of the organization in project-management techniques 


-  Ellyn also reported increased company recognition for the IT groups capabilities and said she is often asked to consult on non-IT issues ,  such as reviews of  recent plan for  power-plant construction project 


-  ,  ITPM can be instrumental in improving communication between business units and IT 


-  ,  Similarly ,  at  leading wireless-services provider ,  portfolio analysis helped identify between $50 million and $75 million in savings from eliminating system and platform redundancies 


-  ,  Our research also revealed how  lack of ITPM could hurt companies after mergers and acquisitions 


-  ,  the largest waste-management-services company in the United States ,  with $11 billion in revenues in 2002 ,  is the result of  series of acquisitions 


-  But the companys aggressive growth strategy hit the skids in the late 1990s 


-  Former Waste Management CIO Tom Smith ,  who joined the company in 1999 ,  said ,  The merger of the prior Waste Management with USA Waste Services in mid-1998 failed ,  and to  large extent this was due to the lack of  common systems foundation 


-  That resulted in the company being unable to manage its resources and measure performance 


-  For example ,  the lack of standardization in the numerous accounting systems meant that  , 100 external consultants and staff had to spend weeks to close the companys books for year-end 1999 


-  ,  When Smith came aboard ,  his main challenge was to create an IT platform that would integrate the independent entities into  united network 


-  Quite simply ,  Smith says ,  the company needed IT systems and processes to gain control of managing the business and the associated metrics to effectively measure the business units performance 


-  Smith believes that the portfolio-management principles used in managing IT spending helped him do exactly that 


-  Waste Management now closes its books in  timely manner ,  drives out costs ,  focuses on improved customer service and ,  most important ,  captures adequate information to run the business 


-  Though it is speculation at this point ,  having had such systems and processes in place might have prevented the companys control gaps and subsequent downfall in 1998 


-  The first two barriers are essentially about poor execution ,  the third relates to the deep-rooted divide between business and IT 


-  ,  As many as 82% of survey respondents identified the ability to estimate IT benefits as  major challenge; 33% never established baselines to compare outcomes against; 30% said project scope changed too often; and 13% said investments lacked known objectives on which to base evaluation 


-  ,  Three examples from the insurance industry indicate the opportunity cost 


-   smaller ,  regional property and casualty  ( P&C )  insurer found 30 full-time-equivalent  ( FTE )  years tied up in two wayward projects lacking ties to business objectives 


-  ,   multinational P&C insurer having more than 20 million policyholders found that ,  in North America alone ,  it supported 375 business applications utilizing 56 development tools and 22 database engines 


-  Portfolio-level scrutiny helped identify six out of 34 capability needs as truly critical  ( for example ,  improved policy underwriting and processing )  ,  so the company was able to prioritize and consolidate application maintenance and development efforts 


-  Detailed analysis revealed its spending was excessive when compared with industry peers as well as many tactical savings opportunities 


-  For example ,  the company was using internal resources to train contractors who were also invoicing training time as billable hours 


-  ,  The percentage of respondents reporting that their IT staff lacked basic working knowledge of financial concepts was 46%; 37% reported frequent staff turnover; 28% said their companies lacked staff and resources to gather data; and 18% said their organization did not provide relevant training 


-  ,  Survey respondents cited  general lack of respect for IT plus communication problems between the CIO and business executives 


-  Interviews revealed that some business leaders ,  in an effort not to expose their ignorance of IT ,  wasted resources by deciding on initiatives without IT consultation ,  then demanded that IT groups manage the projects well or take the blame 


-  Meanwhile ,  some CIOs thought keeping business leaders technologically uninformed translated to job security and thus took little initiative to bridge the divide 


-  ,  Forty-six percent said business leaders didnt understand that ROI is not always applicable 


-  For example ,   manufacturing companys CIO recalled how ,  until auditors finally expressed their concern ,  fellow executives continually dismissed project proposals for security and disaster-recovery assets because they couldnt see immediate bottom-line benefits 


-  As many as 36% of respondents saw  lack of mutual respect between IT and business executives; 30% perceived business leaders as lacking basic technological understanding; and 28% said business executives regarded IT as  necessary evil 


-  ,  Significantly ,  the research reveals  significant skills gap 


-  As many as 46% of respondents agreed that IT staff lack working knowledge of financial concepts 


-  Although most IT staff know what NPV is and how to calculate it ,  they have trouble making  strong business case in partnership with business-unit executives 


- 12 But ,  as the consumer packaged-goods company found ,  making  strong case can lead to executives increasing resources for high-value projects 


-   cross-functional approach that involves IT ,  finance and lines of business is essential 


-  ,  As the CIO of  major manufacturing company explained in an interview ,  The business side did not realize how critical their involvement was 


-  In addition ,  our attitude was  Call me if you have  problem kind of thing 


-  Two things made  difference 


-  Second ,  we realized that both the IT and business people would gradually come around 


-  ,  Resistance to  centralized ITPM process sometimes comes from managers fear of losing budgetary ownership 


-  As the CIO of  major financial-services firm observed ,  Each business unit would manage its own IT budget 


-  They saw corporate IT as taking away their flexibility ,  their independence ,  their freedom 


-  It was  big concern for them ,  and it took us four years to change their mind-set 


-  ,  By its very nature ,  ITPM risks being viewed as  corporate project by the troops ,  and greater transparency is not always welcomed 


-  So the company always had this perception that we were  really low spender in IT just because it wasnt visible 


-  ,  The ambiguity inherent in quantifying ITs business value ,  the lack of communication ,  executives limited understanding of and low respect for IT ,  and IT staffers inadequate business skills  all translate to major organizational challenges for successful implementation 


-  However ,  analysis of practices in the best-managed companies surveyed suggests four approaches that work: staged implementation strategy ,  creating  process for upgrading ITPM ,  ensuring that staff members are trained  and involving business-side people from the beginning 


-  ,  Consistent messages heard throughout the research were that ITPM should be phased in iteratively and that performance feedback is critical 


-  Says John Boushy of Harrahs ,  First ,  [IT portfolio management] instills the discipline of making sure that we are investing in those projects that are floated by the needs of the business and create  tangible return  as evidenced by the business case that has to be developed 


-  At  later stage ,  that discipline then leads to not just evaluating projects on the front end ,  but comparing what the actual performance is on the back end 


-  ,  Most synchronized-level respondents weighed the following four dimensions in deciding how to stage implementation 


-  ,  Successful practitioners focused on specific parts of the organization  ( or budget )  rather than taking on the entire company 


-  Making ITPM work in one business unit or department helped win over skeptics and deter turf battles 


-  Thus the first stage addressed only application-development projects 


-  In the second stage ,  the company added infrastructure assets to the portfolio 


-  The research uncovered portfolio scorecards with as many as 400 metrics 


-  For example ,  if  strategic initiative is to increase operational effectiveness ,   corresponding metric is increase in inventory turns 


-  ,   key feature of  well-managed portfolio is having distinct sets of metrics for different types of investments 


-  One organization ,  for example ,  measures expected risk and return of  project in the planning phase ,  then measures earned value in the delivery phase  and employee productivity during the maintenance phase 


-  ,  The most accomplished ITPM practitioners follow  well-defined process to implement capability upgrades 


-  )  ,  First is design ,  which defines the right objectives and secures buy-in from business leaders 


-  During the second step ,  diagnosis ,   new portfolio baseline is established ,  and the facts to be used in decision making are agreed on 


-  Business units usually apply different IT budget categories: One counts telecommunications as IT ,  while another does not 


-  That results in  mismatch of portfolio data that must be resolved 


-  Those that were redundant or lacked clear links to business objectives were terminated 


-  ,  Portfolio analysis revealed ,  for example ,  that the automaker had myriad product and services vendors working on conflicting and redundant projects under blanket purchase orders without any specific objectives or deliverables 


-  Among the underlying issues: aging legacy systems that are unable to keep up with rapid demand growth; lack of  common technology platform to support business with 500 dealers;  decentralized management structure without incentives for cross-enterprise coordination; and  consensus-based culture averse to transformational change or termination of projects 


-  ,  Recognizing it was misspending IT dollars ,  the car company set out to create an inventory of all projects ,  reassess business-capability needs and develop an investment-prioritization and decision-making mechanism 


-  This resulted in ranking 352 discrete projects and 58 capability needs  ( for example ,  the capability to configure models ,  parts and accessories online )  against six weighted prioritization criteria  ( for example ,  strategic fit ,  with  5% weight; business economics ,  50% weight; and operational impact ,  20% weight )  


-  Each criterion was built from two to nine questions  each translating to  10-point scale  such as Does this project address an identified need? What is our expected payback period? and What is the expected risk- and time-adjusted return on investment? In the end ,  only five of those 58 desired capabilities were judged to be business-critical 


-  The most highly valued capability among synchronized practitioners studied was to excel at measuring and managing the risk of project failure 


-   risk-management strategy for each project can significantly improve project success rates and may require relatively little effort compared with the cost of large projects 


-   simple but effective method is to plot possible risk events on the dimensions of probability of occurrence and severity of consequences 


-  Then specific contingencies can be put in place to deal with risks that have  high level of severity 


-  Approaches such as the Balanced Scorecard can help quantify the extent to which projects are aligned with strategic objectives ,  adding rigor to prioritizing 


-  ,  The key to bridging the business-technology divide and improving results is early communication 


-  Not only must senior business managers understand more about how IT affects both strategy and the bottom line ,  but CIOs also need to learn to communicate the vision ,  strategies and goals of the IT organization in terms that non-IT executives can understand 


-  The most effective partnerships studied were those in which the CIO took the initiative in engaging business leaders about ITPM and eventually transferred accountability to the business 


-  A major step in making business collaboration work was to stop referring to [ITPM] as an IT project ,  said the CIO of  large capital-goods manufacturer 


-  ,  Although only 17% of the organizations polled are at the synchronized stage ,  the prize for that 17% appears to be substantial and suggests that becoming synchronized is the right move for others 


-  The most successful practitioners experienced cost savings of up to 40% of pre-ITPM budgets ,  better alignment between IT spending and business objectives ,  and greater central coordination of IT investments across the organization 


-  By following the steps to establish or upgrade ITPM and by benchmarking against synchronized companies ,  large organizations can make IT an integral part of their competitive advantage
