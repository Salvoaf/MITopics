-  ,  Its true that many companies have research centers or product-development teams scattered around the world 


-  )  ,  To appreciate the far-reaching advantages of metanational innovation ,  consider the battle between Motorola Inc 


-  And Motorola was slow to understand the new ways that mobiles were being used ,  thus failing to recognize that  broader ,  fragmented customer base would spell the end of one-size-fits-all products 


-  For one thing ,  coordination of the innovation process is greatly simplified when the necessary knowledge is available mainly in the heads of people who share the same language and understanding of local context  everything from implicit roles and responsibilities to accepted development cycles 


-  In that respect ,  Intels mind-set is drawing nearer to that of global innovators such as the European chip company STMicroelectronics Group 


-  The supersonic Concorde ,  for instance ,  was  remarkable technological feat ,  but it was also  commercial flop that displayed an embarrassing lack of understanding of customer needs and the competitive dynamics of the market 


-  ,  Thus ,  companies can greatly improve their flow of innovation by assembling the best combinations of technical know-how and market expertise ,  and they can enhance that process substantially by looking far and wide for that knowledge ,  rather than relying solely on local sources 


-  Similarly ,  as companies attempt to offer complete solutions instead of stand-alone products and services ,  they need to obtain  better understanding of the myriad ,  subtle and often unarticulated needs of customers 


-  Furthermore ,  establishing  carefully planned network of alliances with lead customers ,  suppliers ,  universities ,  research institutes and even competitors in various parts of the world can be an invaluable aid in prospecting for new market knowledge or technical know-how 


-  With flat-screen displays ,  for example ,  only manufacturers that combined Western base technology with East Asian process know-how succeeded 


-  Second ,  the more radical the desired innovation ,  the larger the necessary footprint is likely to be 


-  Even so ,  it took sustained efforts by  series of entrepreneurial managers there to convince the parent company that Singapore should play  central role in new-product development 


-  For incremental innovations ,  companies are likely to have an initial good understanding of the knowledge bundle required  ( and hence the optimal footprint )  


-  ,  But much of the knowledge that has the greatest potential for innovation has characteristics that make relocation difficult ,  especially when the recipients dont understand the local context in which the knowledge was generated 


-  But would the transfer of all that information result in  winning vehicle? Probably not ,  because the designer would still lack key elements of knowledge ,  such as how it actually feels to be driving on  snow-covered road at high speeds for considerable distances 


-  )  ,  If both the required technology and market understanding score low on the complexity scale ,  the necessary knowledge can be mobilized by using IT and digital communications tools ,  allowing the various locations to interact at arms length 


-  )  But when the required market knowledge is complex and the technical expertise is readily codified ,  it makes sense to locate the innovation team near the key market knowledge  ( where people can experience the local context firsthand )  and transfer the technological knowledge there  ( upper-left quadrant )  


-  And they continually ask themselves questions along the lines of What distinctive useful knowledge do  see in this local cluster? and How can this piece of knowledge contribute to our global innovation effort? Indeed ,  globalization is  tremendous undertaking ,  requiring not just  change in process but also  dramatically new mind-set
