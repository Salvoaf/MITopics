- When people hear the word services ,  they often think about offerings that are neutral or routine 


-  They conjure up familiar experiences that they navigate regularly  for example ,  dry cleaning ,  haircutting or lawn care 


-  Such services are distinct from the types of services people aspire to use ,  such as those associated with travel and entertainment; for classification purposes ,  these might be labeled positive services 


-  We refer to these as negative services because they deal with events most people hope they will never have to deal with  things such as toothaches ,  leaky roofs or collision repairs 


-  Whereas much of the writing about services has looked at the nature of the activity  ( for example ,  whether it is tangible or intangible )  or has examined the activity from the provider perspective  ( for example ,  in medicine ,  whether the need is acute or chronic )  ,  we take  customer viewpoint 


-  )  ,  Most people feel confident in describing common problems and the routine services they require 


-  But negative services are different: Customers are not able to evaluate the content of the service  only the process  ( and then only after the service has been completed )  


-  Because the precipitating events that trigger the need for negative services are not everyday occurrences ,  many people are not equipped to diagnose their needs or make informed judgments about the solutions required 


-  They may know that they have  toothache or  flooded basement ,  for example ,  but they dont know the right response 


-  Furthermore ,  even after the service has been provided ,  they usually are in  poor position to judge its quality or the price paid for it 


-  Nevertheless ,  there are many cases of unnecessary medical procedures and of consumers wondering if the repair parts they purchased were truly necessary 


-  However ,  in recent years ,  they have become more visible in other industry environments 


-  For example ,  Sears ,  Roebuck and Co 


-  ,  one of the worlds largest retailers of appliances ,  tools and machinery ,  has made negative services  profitable part of its business 


-  health care industry  concerned with diagnosing and treating illnesses and responding to accidents  falls into negative services 


-  So do the tens of thousands of businesses that specialize in repairing cars and unclogging drains 


-  Services shift from being negative to becoming routine when the problems are largely under control and can be managed by the recipients themselves ,  as in the case of people with diabetes 


-  ,  Companies hoping to build positions in negative services face two major challenges:  (  )  how to access inexperienced customers ,  who are not in  strong position to evaluate the service being provided and may have  poor idea of its cost ,  and  (  )  how to organize and deploy their services to meet customer needs when demand is unpredictable 


-  ,  Prospect theory in psychology offers  fresh perspective on how individuals view risks and losses in decision making 


-  It suggests that people are not rational about decisions when they are fearful 


-  They do not study the facts ,  select strategies or weigh the probable outcomes 


-  People in need of negative services approach decisions in  similar fashion 


-  Our investigation suggests that people go through at least three phases when receiving negative services: awareness and selection ,  connection and provision 


-  ,  Though people are conscious of negative services ,  they often deny that the services are intended for them 


-  Consequently ,  the services can be divided into two broad forms: pre-event ,  in which the service recipient acknowledges  probable service need  ( risk )  or has some institutional inducement to anticipate the need ,  and post-event ,  in which the recipient reacts with some urgency to problem signs or symptoms ,  although the specific nature of the problem may not be known 


-  ,  When choosing  pre-event contract ,  few service recipients take the time to understand the quality differences between potential service providers ,  or they may find evaluation difficult 


-  Pre-event contracts ,  often selected on the basis of cost or ease of access ,  frequently lock service recipients into specific provider relationships 


-  An auto insurance company ,  for example ,  may not mandate  specific body shop ,  but it may suggest one 


-  ,  In situations where no pre-event contracts exist and services needs arise  ( that is ,  post-event )  ,  service recipients often assess their service options based on the magnitude of the problem  ( in terms of cost or personal requirement )  and on the time they have available 


-  If the need is urgent ,  as in the case of an auto accident or  broken furnace during winter ,  people may take any port in  storm 


-  They know they need help ,  and ,  unfortunately ,  they are not in the best position to sift through all the possible solutions to determine how much each will cost 


-  ,  Once the need for negative services is evident ,  people often tap into  large network of service providers ,  whether they are aware of it or not 


-   single car accident ,  for example ,  typically triggers the involvement of  towing company ,  at least one insurance company ,  an appraiser ,   body shop and  car rental agency 


-  Some services act as connectors ,  even if the end users dont actively choose them 


-  For example ,  ambulance services play  big role in hospital selection 


-  motorist calls AAA to request road service ,  he or she has no idea which towing company will appear on the scene 


-  ,  In Europe ,  Multiasistencia Group ,   large home assistance and repair company ,  has grown by leveraging relationships with  number of financial institutions; it has no direct relationship with the end users of its services 


-  The Madrid-based company  ( which operates in Spain ,  France ,  the United Kingdom and Portugal )  offers its services through insurance companies ,  banks and other affiliates ,  all of which are trying to cultivate the loyalty of their own customers 


-  For example ,  one of Spains largest banks recently contracted with Multiasistencia to provide  new perk to its credit card holders: 24-hour plumbing and locksmith service 


-  Bank customers pay no charge for service calls ,  and labor costs are discounted substantially below local rates 


-  ,  Many service recipients tend to think in terms of  specific service provider   surgeon ,  mechanic or repair-person  as opposed to  service network 


-  But the work of an individual service provider is often difficult to isolate from all the related services that contribute to the overall experience 


-  Following an accident ,  for example ,  the service recipient  ( in this case ,  the patient )  may perceive that the principal service provider is the attending physician ,  but the ambulances emergency medical technician may be the one who actually saved the patients life 


-  Nonetheless ,  the principal service provider  ( in this case ,  the physician )  is usually in the strongest position to use the goodwill to support his or her growth strategy 


-  Indeed ,  its hard to name  chain of boiler repair specialists ,  body shops or dental offices 


-  Each of these industries has several factors favoring scale economies ,  so the increased level of concentration is not surprising 


-  For negative service providers ,  significant market fragmentation raises important questions about how to approach the market and how to manage the business to achieve the best possible results 


-  )  ,   number of companies have tried  with varying degrees of success  to make negative services  central part of their overall corporate strategies 


-  In the course of analyzing the changing market dynamics within service industries ,  we have identified four core strategies for negative services growth: market-centric ,  provider-centric ,  network management and network enhancement 


-  ,  Since most people have only an infrequent need for negative services ,  it is difficult for specialized service providers to establish and maintain links with customers 


-  In medicine ,  for example ,  it takes  wide network of primary care physicians to keep  narrow specialist busy 


-  Although the likelihood that any one patient will face  specific negative condition is small ,  many primary care physicians referring their cases to  small group of specialists can make for  growth opportunity 


-  ,  Insurance companies have strong market connections and play an organizing role; they provide  pre-event link between service recipients and specific providers 


-  While they influence customer choice ,  they do not provide the actual service 


-  Other companies ,  particularly those with broad market visibility ,  such as Sears ,  have been drawn to the idea of service business expansion ,  even if it is difficult to orchestrate 


-  ,  Sears already had  $3 billion home services business when it established Sears HomeCentral in 1996 


-  Managements goal was to capture an even bigger share of the fragmented home services market ,  which Sears estimated at nearly $160 billion  ( including $60 billion for interior home improvement ,  $50 billion for exterior home improvement ,  $30 billion for residential maintenance and $20 billion for product repair )  


-  ,  Claiming relationships with more than 70 million households and more than 15 million in-home visits per year ,  Sears targeted revenues of $10 billion in 2000 through  mixture of negative and routine services: roofing ,  siding ,  service contracts ,  heating and cooling ,  pest control and windows and doors 


-  Its strength was in time-sensitive household repairs ,  but it anticipated that much future growth would be in areas in which customers had time to research and compare alternatives ,  such as heating and air-conditioning systems 


-  ,  In creating the Sears HomeCentral brand ,  the company launched  major ad campaign to draw attention to its service focus 


-  It offered to repair any appliance ,  not just those purchased at Sears 


-  It invested heavily in training  force of 15 , 000 technicians  ( both employees and independent contractors )  and armed them with the latest technology 


-  To underline its new service focus ,  it acquired  large remodeling contractor and  termite and pest control company 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  the market didnt respond as quickly as management had hoped 


-  Although services were much more profitable than the companys mainstream business ,  using the Sears brand to expand into other businesses was  struggle 


-  The company has closed some of its stores and has chosen to eliminate some of its home services lines  ( such as pest control )  


-  Among other things ,  management learned that the infrastructure for  rapid response to appliance repairs is very different from whats needed to manage services such as deck and siding installation ,  which have longer time frames 


-  ,  Other companies attempting to pursue the market-centric model have had more success in attracting new customers 


-  The Terminix International Company ,   leader in residential pest control ,  based in Memphis ,  Tennessee ,  is  rare example of  company that offers  focused negative service 


-  Acquired in 1986 by The ServiceMaster Company ,   provider of industrial services in Downers Grove ,  Illinois ,  it spends heavily on advertising to establish itself as the homeowners first choice for pest control 


-  In essence ,  Terminix has two segments of customers: those who think they have  pest problem that needs attention  ( because of ,  say ,   rotting deck )  and those who want or need pest inspections when homes are being sold 


-  ,  Gaining  reputation for being the best at what it does or providing good value at low cost helps  negative service provider build its market position 


-  Providers looking to grow need to find ways to create the conditions for easy evaluation by prospective customers 


-  ,  To understand this approach ,  consider the example of the Shouldice Hospital in Thornhill ,  Ontario ,  Canada ,  which specializes in hernia operations 


-  Based on its reputation for postoperative success ,  the Shouldice draws patients from across Canada and the United States ,  despite the fact that its surgeons tend to follow procedures that are more invasive than other treatments 


-  Because it specializes ,  the Shouldice operates more efficiently than hospitals offering  broader range of treatments ,  with less capital and fewer support staff and supplies 


-  ,  In  sense ,  the Shouldice has found  way to move its service of hernia surgery from the negative to the routine 


-  The placement of their centers around the country allows users to travel from their home base and still maintain their treatments 


-  Service providers looking to distinguish themselves as specialists need to figure out how to provide customers with credible and accessible information to evaluate their services 


-  ,   fairly common network management strategy is to piggyback on the business of other companies in order to gain access to customers 


-  This is what Multiasistencia does in the area of home assistance and repair ,  and what credit card loss-protection companies have done by using mailing lists of bank customers 


-  Another company that has pursued this strategy successfully is American Home Shield Corp 


-  ,  AHS is the leading home services warranty specialist in the United States ,  selling warranties to cover repairs throughout homes: major appliances ,  heating and cooling systems ,  plumbing and electrical systems ,  even swimming pools 


-  Founded more than 30 years ago ,  it grew by insuring home buyers against property faults 


-  Rather than marketing warranties directly to customers ,  AHS co-markets pre-event service contracts through banks and mortgage companies that are much better known ,  including Bank of America ,  Chase ,  GE Capital and Wells Fargo Home Mortgage 


-  When problems occur ,  homeowners place calls to AHS ,  which dispatches the appropriate contractor 


-  ,  Network enhancers study negative service networks to see how they can improve the overall service delivery process 


-  They do not manage the whole process or provide the major service content to the end user 


-  Rather ,  they look for opportunities that other network partners will value for managing their customers and integrating the supply network through information systems 


-  ,  which has the largest car rental fleet in the United States ,  has been successful in using this approach 


-   relative latecomer to the car rental business ,  it differentiated itself from the start by placing most of its offices in neighborhood markets ,  rather than focusing on airports and other transportation centers 


-  To appeal to customers ,  one of Enterprises best-known features is providing free transportation to the rental office 


-  ,  Enterprise specializes in renting to customers who need  car because of an accident ,  mechanical repair or theft 


-  Enterprise also tries to make things easy for the insurance companies and auto repair shops by streamlining the reports and using information technology to the fullest extent 


- 10 From  customers view ,  the service is seamless 


-  It links auto body shops to insurance companies  providing service to both  and to the owner of the damaged vehicle 


-  In doing so ,  it attempts to create enough goodwill to generate customer loyalty 


-  ,  the Mountain View ,  California-based financial software company ,  follows  similar approach 


-  Even though tax preparation services are mostly routine ,  Intuits TurboTax product likewise simplified the process of tax preparation by linking the taxpayers employer ,  brokerage service ,  bank and payroll management company 


-  In these circumstances ,  service recipients must communicate directly with service providers regarding the diagnosis of the problem and do their best to understand which repairs are absolutely essential and which can wait 


-  Laidlaw ,  for example ,   diversified company based in Naperville ,  Illinois ,  concentrated on routine services  ( school and intercity buses )  but then diversified into new areas ,  including chemical waste management and ambulance services 


-  Laidlaw management soon realized that combining different kinds of activities was more difficult than it appeared ,  requiring vastly different marketing and management skills 


-  They often attempt to sell both routine and negative services to the same customers 


-  But negative service providers are selected based on the magnitude of the problem and the time available for response ,  whereas customers select routine service providers based on their specific needs and the providers perceived ability to meet them 


-  Some customers have contractual or preexisting relationships; other customers are decision influencers rather than recipients 


-  Different types of customers represent different levels of knowledge and ability to evaluate the services being provided 


-  Contrary to how it may seem ,  there is usually very little on the demand side to justify one-stop shopping 


-  ,  ITS EASY TO SEE why managers have such difficulty understanding negative services 


-  In the course of receiving the service ,  they often feel anxious 


-  And there is no getting around the reality that many negative services are difficult to evaluate before ,  during and after the fact 


-  ,  Although customers tend to be loyal to service providers once they have established relationships ,  the nature of negative services makes for peculiar challenges 


-  Ironically ,  making products more reliable can lead to new challenges: If there are fewer product failures in  given location ,  logistics support on  per unit basis may become more costly to provide 


-  As many manufacturers known for their service can attest ,  being an excellent service provider is not sufficient to build  sustainable service business; it also requires  steady stream of customers 


-  To be successful ,  service providers need to look at both supply and demand and devise flexible relationships on the supply side to meet the fluctuating needs of the market 


-  )  ,  Most of the successful companies we studied achieved sufficient volume and built customer loyalty by broadening the scope of their services 


-  But those who excel in negative services seem to have difficulty broadening beyond them ,  perhaps because meeting negative service needs requires  highly responsive system in which low cost is not the primary concern 


-  ,  Most negative service providers tend to focus on service delivery outcomes  for example ,  successful tooth implants or  perfect auto body paint job 


-  Service recipients ,  on the other hand ,  tend to view things more from  process perspective  how it felt to be the customer or patient and how smoothly the service was delivered 


-  Service providers need to recognize these differences in perspective and develop better ways to educate customers in evaluating their services and the customer service experience 


-  To be successful ,  they must have  deep understanding of the needs of customers and how best to address them
