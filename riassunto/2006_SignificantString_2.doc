-  Thus ,  todays managers need  fuller understanding of continuous change  how it works and how it doesnt 


-  Based on 15 years of studying and observing change in  wide range of organizations ,  we have developed  framework for understanding the underlying structure of continuous change 


-  )  An understanding of those phases can help managers transform their companies into organizations that experience change not as  tumultuous ,  anxiety-inducing event but as part of an everyday routine 


-  But in order for an idea to initiate processes of change ,  it needs to be articulated and presented in ways that influence people 


-  To be successful across diverse stakeholder groups ,  the evangelist needs  wide repertoire of influence strategies 


-  In some cases ,  the idea may simply need to be taken to the right people and presented in  straightforward manner 


-  Evangelists may need to reframe an idea in dramatically different ways for different audiences; to attach the idea to other ideas or plans that are already accepted; to enroll well-respected organizational members to act as spokespersons for the idea; to demonstrate the concrete economic benefits of adopting the idea; to show others how the idea might help advance their own careers 


-  There are 16;  think there should be eight ,  he said 


- You need to be ruthless  


-  He did not address issues of the superorchestras size or the number of positions that would be cut in the process because he first wanted to sow the seeds of his idea 


-  First ,  he wanted to obtain peoples buy-in by gradually getting them involved 


-  First ,  they need to be aware of ,  and have access to ,  the informal networks necessary to sell their ideas 


-  Therefore ,  managers who want their people to act as evangelists must regularly connect them to other groups and individuals across organizational boundaries ,  both vertical and horizontal ,  as well as assist the growth of informal networks 


-  ,  Second ,  evangelists must be adept at persuading others ,  so managers will need to create opportunities for employees to develop those abilities 


-  If organizations want their employees to be able to sell their ideas effectively ,  they need to provide training and development in persuasion skills ,  including storytelling and the creative use of language ,  metaphors ,  symbols and imagery 


-  ,  Third ,  potential evangelists need to feel the organization and those around them support their actions 


-  Thus ,  senior executives need to model positive forms of networking ,  politicking and persuasive communication 


-  And organizations need to reinforce the efforts of evangelists-in-the-making by rewarding their efforts even when their ideas dont prove to be winners 


-  ,   good idea often flounders because its advocates either do not understand what is needed to translate it into action or do not have the resources necessary to do so 


-  ,  The prudent use of authority becomes necessary for three reasons 


-  First ,  although key organizational members may have accepted  new idea ,  they might harbor considerable uncertainty or anxiety about putting it into practice: What if the idea flops ,  or what if others dont follow? At this point ,  someone in charge needs to approve  ( or reject )  the new direction ,  not just in theory but also in everyday practice 


-  In this regard ,  autocrats put their necks on the line and become responsible and accountable for the change 


-  Detailing in practical terms the new behaviors or practices that are required  ( as well as those that need to stop )  will certainly help 


-  But such prescriptions often need to be backstopped with authority 


-  Third ,  authority may be needed to overcome any resistance 


-  That is not to say that continuous change processes incur continuous resistance; however ,  they almost inevitably lead to some resistance ,  often at the point that ideas need to be translated into action 


-  of Vancouver ,  British Columbia ,   leader in the development of software used in semiconductor manufacturing 


-  ,  To be effective ,  autocrats need three things 


-  Its because of this need for credibility that organizations need to maintain stable cadres of line managers who can gradually establish themselves so that ,  when those individuals must fulfill the role of autocrat ,  they will have the ability to lead with authority 


-  Autocrats need to choose among competing ideas and decide which will be adopted and when 


-  That means that organizations must support employees responsible for translating ideas into action by providing them with sufficient autonomy so that potential autocrats neither rush  ( because of pressure from above )  nor unduly hesitate  ( because they need authorization to act )  


-  Someone with practical imagination is able to translate the abstract ,  metaphorical or conceptual into tangible sets of behaviors and practices that make sense in the context of the organization and its work 


-  Thus ,  to institutionalize change ,  organizations need an architect to design the systems necessary to embed the change in corporate routines ,  ensuring its maintenance independent of the shifting responsibilities and attentions of the evangelists and autocrats 


-  The goal is to entrench the desired behaviors and practices so deeply that they become not only routine but taken for granted 


-  That can be accomplished with information ,  manufacturing and financial systems ,  as well as with the physical work space  the floors ,  walls and areas that bring people together ,  keep them apart and channel their movement through the organization 


-  That said ,  phase  of the change cycle is  precarious one that needs to happen quickly ,  efficiently and visibly; if it doesnt ,  enthusiasm could dissipate ,  frustrating those invested in the process 


-  After some consideration ,  the TD system was selected with certain added Canada Trust functionality 


-  Because employee and customer satisfaction is initially going to go down in  merger ,  explains Tomczyk ,  what you want to do is make sure the dip is as shallow as it can be and that you come out of it as quickly as you can 


-  The satisfaction-monitoring systems used at TD Canada Trust helped ensure that the mergers strategic aim of building  better bank did not get lost in the noise 


-  Architects like Tomczyk typically have  breadth of experience in the organization ,  that allows them to understand the strategic purpose of its different elements and how everything fits together to accomplish corporate goals 


-  ,  Architects also need technical expertise  the skills and knowledge to understand exactly what can be built so that they can translate inspiration into processes and structures 


-  ,  For organizations to develop successful architects ,  they will want to encourage senior executives to build multidisciplinary career paths 


-  Companies that have traditionally looked only to finance or marketing for their leaders ,  for instance ,  need to broaden their scope to those with expertise in other areas 


-  The goal is an environment that fosters innovation and strategic thinking ,  setting the stage for the birth of new ideas that can then be picked up ,  evangelized and integrated 


-  Intuition typically arises from employees expertise in particular domains  their sophisticated understanding of markets ,  processes and customers that are built on deep experience 


-  Thus ,  Heath promoted work experiences for engineering personnel that would provide them with an ongoing education in the needs of their customers and their roles in addressing those needs 


-  ,  That practice has dramatically shaped the engineers understanding of customer problems ,  and it has deepened their appreciation of the value of different technological solutions 


-  For Triant ,  such knowledge has enhanced the companys ability to create new products that exactly match customer needs 


-  In contrast ,  educators often depend on subtlety ,  leading others to work in ways that indirectly shift their perceptions and understandings 


-  To accomplish that ,  educators need  combination of two key skills 


-  It was Heaths appreciation of that relationship that led him to realize that Triants engineers were going to be the key to generating the ideas that could fuel the next cycles of innovation and change 


-  ,  The second critical skill is the ability to create work experiences for employees that will enable them to acquire an understanding of the companys strategic direction and gain the expertise necessary to extend that direction through product ,  process and organizational innovations 


-  Nevertheless ,   key difference between organizations that successfully manage continuous change and those that dont is employees who both understand why change is necessary and have the ability to do the sort of double-takes required to understand how and why current practices differ from previous ones ,  and why and when alternative practices might be more appropriate 


-  To understand this better ,  note that the underlying structure of continuous change is associated with two key balancing points: one that falls between individuals and systems as instruments of change ,  and the other between cognition and behavior as the target of change efforts 


-  )  ,  Recall that phases  and  rely on the ability of individuals to affect the thinking and behavior of others: Evangelists influence the beliefs of other employees ,  and autocrats dictate their behaviors 


-  In contrast ,  phases  and  rely on organizational systems as the levers of change: Architects use technological systems to institutionalize new practices ,  and educators employ organizational culture to shape employees sense of mastery 


-  Such an organization will work hard to ensure that employees understand their importance ,  providing them with the resources ,  training and connections needed to spark change 


-  Automated manufacturing systems ,  information technologies ,  systematized training and socialization schemes ,  and formalized product-planning processes all ensure that the current wisdom of the organization is embedded in its routines and practices ,  and in employees self-understandings 


-  This balance between thinking and doing is reflected in the focus of  companys change efforts 


-  Executives and managers spend significant time ensuring that employees understand the companys mission and its relationship to their own work but fail to make sure that those concepts are translated into action 


-  In short ,   focus on thinking at the expense of doing leads to enthusiasm for new ideas but  failure to implement them 


-  These companies are often bottom-line oriented: Managers understand that all the talk in the world doesnt mean  thing unless its translated into action 


-  In practice ,  what this amounts to is  need for companies to ensure that their ranks include evangelists ,  autocrats ,  architects and educators
