- As managers become more comfortable with including blogs and social networks as part of their integrated marketing communications ,  they have naturally turned their attention to questions regarding the return on investment of social media 


-  Clearly ,  there is no shortage of interest in the topic 


-   quick Google search recently for ROI social media returned over  


-  Internet marketing and online retailing conferences now devote attention to ROI issues ,  and managers are asking themselves every day ,  Whats the ROI of [substitute social media application here]? Blog posts ,  white papers and case studies prepared by social media gurus ,  consultants and industry analysts abound ,  yet the answer remains largely unsatisfying 


-  ,  We understand the pressures and the desire to quantify the return generated by investing in social media ,  but we believe most marketers are approaching the issue the wrong way 


-  ,  Effective social media measurement should start by turning the traditional ROI approach on its head 


-  That is ,  instead of emphasizing their own marketing investments and calculating the returns in terms of customer response ,  managers should begin by considering consumer motivations to use social media and then measure the social media investments customers make as they engage with the marketers brands 


-  ,  Handling the measurements this way makes much more sense 


-  It takes into account not only short-term goals such as increasing sales in the next month via  social media marketing campaign or reducing costs next quarter due to more responsive online support forums ,  but also the long-term returns of significant corporate investment in social media 


-  ,  We will explain our reasoning in detail and suggest some guidelines for better integrating social media into your overall marketing strategy ,  but first  quick example of the kind of radical rethinking we believe is called for 


-  ,  In calculating social media ROI ,  most marketers start by measuring the cost of launching  blog ,  for example ,  and then seek to calculate the return on sales ,  say ,  from that social media investment 


-  But  company could also start by thinking about what marketing objectives such  blog might satisfy  (  


-  ,  to learn about new products )  and what behaviors they might engage in once they got there  (  


-  ,  post  comment about  recent consumption experience )  that could be linked to the companys marketing objectives 


-  This suggests that returns from social media investments will not always be measured in dollars ,  but also in customer behaviors  ( consumer investments )  tied to particular social media applications 


-  Consumer investments include obvious measures such as the number of visits and time spent with the application  ( the blog in this case )  as well as more active investments ,  such as the valence of blog comments and the number of Facebook updates and Twitter pages about the brand 


-  These investments can then be used to measure key marketing outcomes such as changes in awareness levels or word-of-mouth increases over time 


-  ,  Although what we are proposing might seem radical ,  we believe you have no choice 


-  ,  Traditional media measurement seems almost quaint in todays dynamic and increasingly complex media environment 


-  Marketers are struggling with social media measurement partly because the frameworks are still largely driven by reach and frequency and are ill-suited to the interactive media environment 


-  ,  On one side are the managers in the trenches whose experience and gut feelings tell them that social media are important ,  even as they struggle with how to quantify this 


-  On the other side is top management ,  who may not be 100% convinced about the value of social media or fully understand them  and even if they get it in principle ,  they still want to see the numbers 


-  This tension explains the constant questioning about ROI in emerging advertising media like Twitter 


-  ,  While managers certainly need hard numbers to know whether their investments are paying off ,  they represent  narrow show me the return focus rooted in  traditional mainstream media 


-  First ,  it is oriented to the short term  ( show me how my companys tweets will improve sales next quarter )  


-  Developing meaningful relationships with customers takes time because online relationships involve interactive conversations ,  and some managers still do not fully appreciate that they are entering  brave new world of relationships with customers 


-  ,  This is  world in which customers are fully in control of their online experiences and where their motivations lead them to connect online with other consumers while they create and consume online content ,  much of it user- rather than marketer-generated 


-  These four key motivations  connections ,  creation ,  consumption and control  drive consumer use of social media 


-  This 4cs perspective is important because it leads to  consumer-oriented framework for evaluating social media 


-  ,  Both these things call for  different way of thinking about how to measure social media 


-  Most managers feel pressure to emphasize traditional objectives such as direct sales ,  direct cost reductions or increases in market share from social media 


-  And  marketer who wants to know the immediate effect on sales of  particular social media campaign can do so relatively easily by tracking the revenue generated from the dollars spent ,  even if tying social media actions directly to sales is difficult 


-  It is becoming increasingly obvious that social media can lead to real cost savings ,  such as when customers serve as their own version of  companys toll-free help desk through FAQs on user forums 


-  It is also clear that social media can improve the efficiency of market research efforts when ,  for example ,  marketers set up online prediction markets to crowdsource new ideas or mine online forums that allow customers to comment on product concepts and offer improvements for existing products 


-  ,  Sales ,  cost efficiencies ,  product development and market research are obvious objectives ,  but in our development of appropriate social media metrics we want to emphasize objectives that take advantage of the distinctive characteristics of social media 


-  In the social media environment ,  marketers have unique opportunities to develop social media programs that tackle awareness ,  engagement and word-of-mouth objectives 


-  Social media applications can fulfill any of these objectives ,  where the appropriate set of metrics depends on the objective 


-  )  ,  To get an ROI estimate ,  managers would link the social media metrics to an additional set of proxy benchmarks  (  


-  ,  the likelihood of future purchase by  user engaged with the companys brand through  specific social media application ,  or the reach of  specific word-of-mouth element and subsequent conversion to future sales )  


-  For example ,   popular personal care brand ran  large-scale integrated ad campaign on MySpace in the second quarter of 2008 and used matched consumer panels to link online social media behavior to survey measures of purchase intent as well as actual in-store sales 


-  The results showed an ROI of 28% for the ad campaign 


-  ,  As this example shows ,  companies are starting to see some success measuring the ROI of their social media experiments ,  including some that offer the consumer  relatively complex social media experience 


-  For example ,  in 2007 ,  Kellogg created an integrated digital media experience for the Special  Challenge featuring  support website that offered consumers the opportunity to customize  diet using Special  cereal ,  participate in online forums with pointers from experts ,  join  Yahoo! e-mail support group and click through to Amazon 


- com to purchase the cereal 


-  Vocalpoint ,  Procter  Gambles social networking site ,  has over 350 , 000 members who talk about P&G products; by linking these customer investments in brand conversation to sales ,  the site is credited with market response increases of up to 30% 


-  ,  To be sure ,  there is some complexity involved in calculating the ROI of  sophisticated social media campaign ,  not necessarily limited to determining the size of the test and control samples and the ability to match online customer profiles with offline purchases 


-  However ,  even small-scale social media efforts can benefit from plugging in segment-level estimates and proxy measures to quantify how the customer investments from brand awareness ,  brand engagement and word of mouth affect the purchase decision funnel and ,  ultimately ,  the bottom line 


-  We expect that over time the number and quality of the necessary inputs will increase ,  but marketers can find even rough proxy estimates useful in the meantime to generate the calculations necessary to link marketing investments to customer investments and market response 


-  ,  Below we discuss three social media objectives and provide several examples of each 


-  Online ,  however ,  marketers have  number of ways to track brand awareness 


-  ,  In the social media environment ,  every time  person uses an application designed by or about the company ,  the company gains increased exposure to its brand ,  often in highly relevant contexts 


-  For example ,  several days before Election Day 2008 ,  Starbucks ran  spot on the Saturday Night Live show as well as on YouTube ,  promoting  free coffee giveaway 


-  Twitter mentions of Starbucks skyrocketed ,  averaging  mention every eight seconds ,  which translated into  sizeable increase in brand exposure 


-  Such usages enhance and strengthen associations of the brand in customers minds through increased exposures 


-  ,  Another example is Naked Pizza ,   New Orleans ,  Louisiana-based business catering to health-conscious pizza lovers ,  which tweeted about its pizzas in 2009 and successfully drew around  , 000 followers in just  few months 


-  The company also kept track of sales that were spurred by  billboard outside its shop encouraging customers to follow it on Twitter 


-  The microblogging campaigns success culminated in the company breaking its one-day sales record ,  with more than 68% of its sales coming from customers who were Twitter followers 


-  Also on that day ,  85% of the companys new customers claimed they had been motivated to buy from Naked Pizza because of Twitter 


-  ,  Finally ,  in what have rapidly become classics in the social media sphere ,  K-Tecs blender brand Blendtec posted  series of humorous demonstration videos in which the companys founder ,  Tom Dickson ,  posed the question Will it Blend? and then proceeded to blend iPhones ,  glow sticks ,  golf balls and many other products previously thought unblendable using his line of hardy blenders 


-  The Will It Blend? campaign quickly went viral and as  result saw its sales grow fivefold 


-  ,  Brand engagement can be enhanced through social media in various ways ,  and the results can be strikingly positive 


-  Visits to the new and improved blog rose by 25% ,  page views increased 40% and visitors stayed 26% longer on the companys website 


-  The blog engaged customers on touchy subjects like assigned seating and used the results from 700 posts as  virtual focus group 


-  On their own ,  thousands of members generated significant buzz with regular posts ,  which in turn motivated numerous others to join and participate on the networking site 


-   Facebook application called Circle of Moms  which let mothers post messages ,  arrange carpools ,  set up back-to-school checklists and click through to promotions on the Target site  generated more than 20 , 000 visitors in six weeks 


-  ,  These highly engaging social media campaigns involving user-generated content likely generate commitment on the part of the consumer ,  reinforcing loyalty to the brand and making the customer more likely to commit additional effort to support the brand in the future 


-  The bottom-line rewards for this kind of engagement may be observed through delayed sales 


-  Online ,  marketers can use one-time versus repeated interactions or active participation compared to passive consumption of social media as proxy measures 


-  Satisfied and loyal consumers communicate their positive attitudes toward the brand itself or toward the social application created by the company  ( be it  Facebook application or group ,   Twitter presence ,   blog or  YouTube video )  to new ,  prospective customers both online and offline 


-  Dissatisfied and disgruntled customers may also share their negative attitudes toward the brand or poor social applications ,  as when technology journalist Jeff Jarvis blogged in 2005 about the shoddy customer service he received from Dell  his own Dell Hell that spread like wildfire on the Internet and mainstream media  and Dell saw its customer satisfaction score drop five points in one year 


- 10 On the positive side ,  Japanese gaming company Square Enix started an online community to stir up interest in its North American release of Sonys Playstation  video game Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King 


-  The North American online community was  success ,  drawing more than 14 , 000 members to join its forum ,  with 30% recruited via word of mouth from existing members; 40% of the online community pre-ordered the game 


-  Though later pulled ,  the reverse word-of-mouth campaign resulted in members unfriending  total of 234 , 000 Facebook friends 


-  These abandoned friends monitored by the application received alerts informing them that they had been sacrificed for  Whopper 


-  The offbeat campaign resulted in significant word of mouth for Burger King 


-  ,  Traditionally ,  companies can estimate word of mouth through surveys that measure the likelihood of recommendation or can use customer satisfaction ,  loyalty and purchase likelihood as proxies for word of mouth ,  but online ,  word of mouth can be measured directly 


-  More sophisticated methodologies are often required to measure word of mouth because  significant amount can occur either offline or online via private communication ,  where direct measurement is impossible 


-  User-generated content can also embed consumers favorite brands  ( such as in  video on YouTube or  photo posted on Flickr )  and contribute to word of mouth  and companies can organize such experiences on behalf of their consumers 


-  For example ,  Atrapalo 


- com ,  one of Spains leading online travel agencies ,  included on its site  way for consumers to share travel videos and customer photos 


-  ,  The advantage of starting with consumer motivations ,  as opposed to trying to figure out what social media application to use ,  is that it makes clear how seemingly disparate applications are actually quite similar if they share the same underlying motivations for use 


-  This makes the job of creating integrated marketing campaigns not only less overwhelming for the manager but also much more closely tied to online consumer behavior 


-  ,  In other words ,  the question is not whether to blog or tweet ,  but what objectives need to be achieved and which set of tools with their corresponding metrics can best achieve them 


-  ,  Once managers have  set of objectives in place for their social media efforts and understand that consumers are motivated to make investments in companies social media efforts through their interactions with the brand ,  the next step is to consider the strategic options for social media measurement 


-  ,  Our simple    framework ,  which assumes the manager has  social media effort ongoing ,  neatly summarizes the choices managers face as they strive to develop social media strategy and suggests better  ( and worse )  paths toward social media success 


-  Managers find themselves in this quadrant as  result of the throw it on the wall and see what sticks strategy and perform arbitrary changes with no way to measure their impact 


-  Because measurement is fuzzy and the efforts effectiveness appears to be failing ,  the manager has little insight or idea on what to do 


-  This is distinctly different than the dead end scenario ,  because even though the manager does not believe he is succeeding ,  at least he is making some attempt to measure social media effectiveness 


-  Since the components are being measured ,  there are probably some good clues about what is going wrong 


-  Since the components are being measured ,  the manager can purposefully iterate to improve even more 


-  This quadrant is tricky because although it is  reasonable place to start ,  you want to move out of it as fast as possible so you dont get stuck here 


-  ,  Managers have two good options for moving from nave optimism to iterate for success and one poor choice 


-  Let us examine the poor choice first 


-  This is because the lack of measurement will eventually lead to deterioration in the efforts effectiveness over time ,  particularly as competitors are able to do it better 


-  In either case ,  the goal is to move away from fuzzy measurement and toward quantifiable metrics where the manager can get  real handle on what is working and what is not and then follow the best path that will get him where he needs to go 


-  Although measuring the ROI of social media efforts is important and necessary ,  it is far more important that managers make sure their social media efforts are effective ,  even if the state of ROI measurement may be less than satisfactory 


-  In order to maximize the effectiveness of their social media efforts ,  managers must recognize two important facts of social media life when implementing social media campaigns 


-  For example ,   manager can control who posts to  blog devoted to the companys brand 


-  Many managers still approach social media as if the practices  and consumer behaviors  are largely fixed 


-  Social media-savvy managers know this is not the case ,  but traditional beliefs about how to reach consumers and potential consumers die hard 


-  ,  Our premise is that social media efforts that are developed in the context of the 4cs  connections ,  creation ,  consumption and control  that underlie consumer motivations to participate will lead to higher ROI because the companys marketing investments can better leverage the active investments its customers will make as they engage with the companys brands 


-  These investments can take the form of blog comments ,  registration and active participation to become  part of  brand-related community ,  private endorsements of  brand or product  (  tweet or retweet ,  Facebook comment ,  review ,  blog post or offline recommendations to friends )  and the like 


-  While the content of consumers interactions is largely out of managers control ,  setting up the framework to facilitate that interaction is squarely in their control 


-  Instead ,  they listen carefully because they know that consumers not only consume the campaign ,  but can comment on it  ( create )  ,  share it with their friends and anyone else  ( connect )  and provide their uncensored thoughts about it  ( control )  for any and all to view 


-  For example ,  if  consumer posts  question to the managers blog ,  someone with  face in the company must reply 


-  If  video is uploaded ,  someone must monitor the Twitter stream for comments and be prepared to react if problems appear 


-  The result tends to be campaigns that expect the customer to work for the brand 


-  In contrast ,  effective social media strategies put the brand to work for the customers by satisfying their needs to create ,  consume ,  connect and control in the social Web 


-  The social metrics that reflect these kinds of social media behaviors are important not only because they let marketers measure the bottom-line impact of their social media efforts ,  but also because they focus marketers attention on social media strategies that take into account the objectives of both the brand and the online customer 


-  ,  There is reason to be highly optimistic about improving the effectiveness of social media 


-  The social Web is  highly measurable environment ,  and it is  relatively simple matter for  manager to measure the number of product reviews ,  blog posts and comments ,  retweets and appearances in the social network timelines of the companys brands 


-  At the same time ,  managers are often able to measure click-throughs to transactional websites ,  as well as capture the number of leads generated or conversion rates for online sales 


-  ,  offline purchases or offline word of mouth )  ,  we think that carefully planned social media campaigns afford phenomenal opportunities for relatively easy and cost-efficient measurement of customers online investments in  companys brands
