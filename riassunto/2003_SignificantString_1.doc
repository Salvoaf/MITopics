-  Rather ,  superior customer-relating capability is  function of how  business builds and manages its organization 


-  To do so ,  managers must gain  greater understanding of each 


-  The last step was to incorporate customer-service metrics into the employee evaluation criteria and provide rewards for superior service 


-  As  result of its efforts to reconfigure the organization in favor of its customers ,  the aircraft-engine group now routinely earns high ratings on  range of customer-satisfaction metrics and is seen by its customers as an important contributor to their productivity 


-  ,  To understand how differences in customer-relationship capability lead to differences in financial performance ,  consider credit-card providers Capital One and First USA ,   subsidiary of Bank One Corp 


-  Because it has acquired many of its customers indirectly ,  First USA has been unable to obtain the data needed to build warehouses of rich customer information  the raw material of the customer-relating capability 


-  ,  The process of improving  customer-relating capability has much in common with that of creating  market-driven organization ,  in which success comes when commitment by the companys leaders signals that they are serious about the initiative ,  when the key implementers understand the need for change and see what must be done differently ,  and when there is  sense of urgency 


-  ,  These general guidelines are not sufficient ,  however ,  because  program for improving  customer-relating capability introduces additional complications and pressure points 


-  The antidotes are  deep immersion in the customer experience and an understanding of what customers expect from  closer relationship

-  To gain organizationwide commitment to the improvement program ,  companies should invest in market understanding and align the configuration; only then should they install CRM technology 


-  ,  The key to such understanding is segmentation: The more  company can break down its customers into different groups with different needs and expectations ,  the better it can serve them 


-  ,  The turning point came when the publisher set out to understand how its customers viewed the total experience of dealing with the company 


-  Many companies dont know their customer defection rate or their customer-purchase share 


-  Companies that sustain their commitment send  signal to both their employees and customers that their customer-relating capability is one of the centerpieces of their strategy 


-  The widespread disappointments with CRM systems are  warning about how difficult it is to improve  customer-relating capability
