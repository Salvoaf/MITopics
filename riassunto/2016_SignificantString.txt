- The impact of digital technology on how businesses design and produce goods ,  interact with their supply chains ,  manage internal communication ,  and connect with customers is  rich topic that has been ,  and continues to be ,  broadly addressed in both commercial and academic business media 


-  ,  But as the digital revolution enters its next phase ,  we find ourselves confronting  new set of questions about the relationship between technology and management 


-  These questions go to the core of the organization: ,  And as the influence of those who write the lines of software that help manage our lives and work continues to increase ,  Quis custodiet ipsos coders? ,  Technology pervades organizations across the globe ,  yet the organizational form has ,  thus far ,  transformed relatively little as  result; the way we lead organizations even less so 


-   believe that is about to change 


-  Today ,  there is  growing wellspring of research and insight exploring technologys foundational impacts on management ,  emerging from both the academy and industry 


-  ,  MIT Sloan Management Review intends to lead the conversation on how technology is transforming the practice of management and reshaping the organization 


-  The centerpiece of this effort is  new editorial initiative called Frontiers ,  which will appear as part of both our print magazine and our website 


-  Frontiers debuted online earlier this year and launches in print with this edition of the magazine 


-  ,  To celebrate the launch of Frontiers and to help us set the course for our coverage to come ,  we asked 15 leading thinkers from academic and business circles to share their insights on managements digital future by contributing essays in response to the following question: How will technology transform the practice of management in the next five years in  way we have not yet witnessed? ,  Not surprisingly ,  many of our contributors focused their attention on the evolving relationship between humans and cognitive technologies 


-  Do continual advances in intelligent algorithms and learning machines represent an existential threat to management as we know it? Perhaps that overstates things  bit ,  but the tone of the conversation about technologys role in the organization is changing dramatically 


-  We now speak of software as  colleague and  coworker 


-  Humans and machines working as peers and collaborators no longer appears to be the stuff of science fiction 


-  We must take care in managing the effects of technological innovation on humans and humanity 


-  At the same time ,  we cannot shrink from our responsibility to harness technologys profound potential to improve our world 


-  Its the beginning of  new agenda for the practice of management
