- The impact of digital technology on how businesses design and produce goods ,  interact with their supply chains ,  manage internal communication ,  and connect with customers is  rich topic that has been ,  and continues to be ,  broadly addressed in both commercial and academic business media 


-  ,  But as the digital revolution enters its next phase ,  we find ourselves confronting  new set of questions about the relationship between technology and management 


-  These questions go to the core of the organization: ,  And as the influence of those who write the lines of software that help manage our lives and work continues to increase ,  Quis custodiet ipsos coders? ,  Technology pervades organizations across the globe ,  yet the organizational form has ,  thus far ,  transformed relatively little as  result; the way we lead organizations even less so 


-   believe that is about to change 


-  Today ,  there is  growing wellspring of research and insight exploring technologys foundational impacts on management ,  emerging from both the academy and industry 


-  ,  MIT Sloan Management Review intends to lead the conversation on how technology is transforming the practice of management and reshaping the organization 


-  The centerpiece of this effort is  new editorial initiative called Frontiers ,  which will appear as part of both our print magazine and our website 


-  Frontiers debuted online earlier this year and launches in print with this edition of the magazine 


-  ,  To celebrate the launch of Frontiers and to help us set the course for our coverage to come ,  we asked 15 leading thinkers from academic and business circles to share their insights on managements digital future by contributing essays in response to the following question: How will technology transform the practice of management in the next five years in  way we have not yet witnessed? ,  Not surprisingly ,  many of our contributors focused their attention on the evolving relationship between humans and cognitive technologies 


-  Do continual advances in intelligent algorithms and learning machines represent an existential threat to management as we know it? Perhaps that overstates things  bit ,  but the tone of the conversation about technologys role in the organization is changing dramatically 


-  We now speak of software as  colleague and  coworker 


-  Humans and machines working as peers and collaborators no longer appears to be the stuff of science fiction 


-  We must take care in managing the effects of technological innovation on humans and humanity 


-  At the same time ,  we cannot shrink from our responsibility to harness technologys profound potential to improve our world 


-  Its the beginning of  new agenda for the practice of management 


- Surveying the landscape of recent attempts at business model innovation ,  one could be forgiven for believing that success is essentially random 


-  ,  with its Midas touch for innovation ,  might be more likely to succeed in its business model innovation efforts than  traditional ,  older ,  industrial company like the automaker Daimler AG 


-  But thats not always the case 


-  Google+ ,  which Google launched in 2011 ,  has failed to gain traction as  social network ,  while at this writing Daimler is building  promising new venture ,  car2go ,  which has become one of the worlds leading car-sharing businesses 


-  Are those surprising outcomes simply anomalies ,  or could they have been predicted? ,  To our eyes ,  the landscape of failed attempts at business model innovation is crowded  and becoming more so  as management teams at established companies mount both offensive and defensive initiatives involving new business models 


-   venture capitalist who advises large financial services companies on strategy shared his observation about the anxiety his investors feel about the changes underway in their industry: They look at the fintech [financial technology] startups and see their business models being unbundled and attacked at every point in the value chain 


-   PwC survey published in 2015 revealed that 54% of CEOs worldwide were concerned about new competitors entering their market ,  and an equal percentage said they had either begun to compete in nontraditional markets themselves or considered doing so 


-  For its part ,  the Boston Consulting Group reports that in  2014 survey of  , 500 senior executives ,  94% stated that their companies had attempted some degree of business model innovation 


-  ,  Weve decided to wade in at this juncture because business model innovation is too important to be left to random chance and guesswork 


-  Executed correctly ,  it has the ability to make companies resilient in the face of change and to create growth unbounded by the limits of existing businesses 


-  Further ,  we have seen businesses overcome other management problems that resulted in high failure rates 


-  But management expert  


-  Edwards Deming demonstrated that manufacturing doesnt have to be random ,  and ,  having incorporated his insights in the 1980s ,  the major automotive companies have made lemons  memory of  bygone era 


-  To our eyes ,  there are currently  lot of lemons being produced by the business model innovation process  but it doesnt have to be that way 


-  ,  In our experience ,  when the business world encounters an intractable management problem ,  its  sign that business executives and scholars are getting something wrong  that there isnt yet  satisfactory theory for whats causing the problem ,  and under what circumstances it can be overcome 


-  This is what has resulted in so much wasted time and effort in attempts at corporate renewal 


-  And this confusion has spawned  welter of well-meaning but ultimately misguided advice ,  ranging from prescriptions to innovate only close to the core business to assertions about the type of leader who is able to pull off business model transformations ,  or the capabilities  business requires to achieve successful business model innovation 


-  ,  The hard truth about business model innovation is that it is not the attributes of the innovator that principally drive success or failure ,  but rather the nature of the innovation being attempted 


-  Business models develop through predictable stages over time  and executives need to understand the priorities associated with each business model stage 


-  Business leaders then need to evaluate whether or not  business model innovation they are considering is consistent with the current priorities of their existing business model 


-  This analysis matters greatly ,  as it drives  whole host of decisions about where the new initiative should be housed ,  how its performance should be measured ,  and how the resources and processes at work in the company will either support it or extinguish it 


-  ,  This truth has revealed itself to us gradually over time ,  but our thinking has crystallized over the past two years in an intensive study effort we have led at the Harvard Business School 


-  As part of that research effort ,  we have analyzed 26 cases of both successful and failed business model innovation; in addition ,  we have selected  set of nine industry-leading companies whose senior leaders are currently struggling with the issue of conceiving and sustaining success in business model innovation 


-  )  We have profiled these nine companies efforts extensively ,  documented their successes and failures ,  and convened their executives on campus periodically to enable them to share insights and frustrations with each other 


-  Stepping back ,  weve made  number of observations that we hope will prove generally helpful ,  and we also have  sense of the work that remains to be done 


-  ,  There are  number of lessons that managers can learn from past successes and failures ,  but all depend on understanding the rules that govern business model formation and development  how new models are created and how they evolve across time ,  the kinds of changes that are possible to those models at various stages of development ,  and what that means for organizational renewal and growth 


-  ,  The confusion surrounding business model innovation begins ,  appropriately enough ,  with confusion about the term business model 


-  In our course at the Harvard Business School ,  we teach students to use  four-box business model framework that we developed with colleagues from the consulting firm Innosight LLC 


-  This framework consists of the value proposition for customers  ( which we will refer to as the job to be done )  the organizations resources ,  such as people ,  cash ,  and technology; the processes3 that it uses to convert inputs to finished products or services; and the profit formula that dictates the margins ,  asset velocity ,  and scale required to achieve an attractive return 


-  )  Collectively ,  the organizations resources and processes define its capabilities  how it does things  while its customer value proposition and profit formula characterize its priorities  what it does ,  and why 


-  ,  This way of viewing business models is useful for two reasons 


-  First ,  it supplies  common language and framework to understand the capabilities of  business 


-  Second ,  it highlights the interdependencies among elements and illuminates what  business is incapable of doing 


-  Interdependencies describe the integration required between individual elements of the business model  each component of the model must be congruent with the others 


-  ,  Understanding the interdependencies in  business model is important because those interdependencies grow and harden across time ,  creating another fundamental truth that is critical for leaders to understand: Business models by their very nature are designed not to change ,  and they become less flexible and more resistant to change as they develop over time 


-  Leaders of the worlds best businesses should take special note ,  because the better your business model performs at its assigned task ,  the more interdependent and less capable of change it likely is 


-  The strengthening of these interdependencies is not an intentional act by managers; rather ,  it comes from the emergence of processes that arise as the natural ,  collective response to recurrent activities 


-  The longer  business unit exists ,  the more often it will confront similar problems and the more ingrained its approaches to solving those problems will become 


-  We often refer to these ingrained approaches as  businesss culture 


-  ,  In fact ,  this pattern is so consistent and important that weve begun to think of the development of  business model across time as resembling  journey whose progress and route are predictable  although the time that it takes  business model to follow this journey will differ by industry and circumstance 


-  )  As the diagram depicts ,   business model ,  which in an established company is typically embodied in  business unit ,  travels  one-way journey ,  beginning with the creation of the new business unit and its business model ,  then shifting to sustaining and growing the business unit ,  and ultimately moving to wringing efficiency from it 


-  Each stage of the journey supports  specific type of innovation ,  builds  particular set of interdependencies into the model ,  and is responsive to  particular set of performance metrics 


-  This is the arc of the journey of virtually every business model  if it is lucky and successful enough to travel the entire length of the route 


-  Unsuccessful business units will falter before concluding the journey and be absorbed or shuttered 


-  Now ,  lets explore each of the three stages and how the business model evolves through them 


-  ,  Peter Drucker once said that the purpose of  business is to create  customer 


-  That goal characterizes the first stage of the journey ,  when the business searches for  meaningful value proposition ,  which it can design initial product and service offerings to fulfill 


-  This is the stage at which  relatively small band of resources  (  founding team armed with an idea ,  some funding and ambition ,  and sometimes  technology )  is entirely focused on developing  compelling value proposition  fulfilling  significant unmet need ,  or job 


-  The information swirling around them at this point in the journey  the information they pay the most attention to  consists of insights they are able to glean into the unfulfilled jobs of prospective customers 


-  ,  We emphasize the primacy of the job at this point of the journey because it is very difficult for  business to remain focused on  customers job as the operation scales 


-  Understanding the progress  customer is trying to make  and providing the experiences in purchase and use that will fulfill that job perfectly  requires patient ,  bottom-up inquiry 


-  The language that is characteristic of this stage is the language of questions ,  not of answers 


-  This gives the business an incredible flexibility that will disappear as it evolves along the journey and its language shifts from questions to answers 


-  ,  Business units lucky and skilled enough to discover an unfulfilled job and develop  product or service that addresses it enter the sustaining innovation phase of the business model journey 


-  At this stage ,  customer demand reaches the point where the greatest challenge the business faces is no longer determining whether the product fulfills  job ,  but rather scaling operations to meet growing demand 


-  Whereas in the creation phase the business unit created customers ,  in the sustaining innovation phase it is building these customers into  reliable ,  loyal base and building the organization into  well-oiled machine that delivers the product or service flawlessly and repeatedly 


-  The innovations characteristic of this phase of the business model journey are what we call sustaining innovations  in other words ,  better products that can be sold for higher prices to the current target market 


-  ,   curious change sets in at this stage of the journey ,  however: As the business unit racks up sales ,  the voice of the customer gets louder ,  drowning out to some extent the voice of the job 


-  Why does this happen? Its not that managers intend to lose touch with the job ,  but while the voice of the job is faint and requires interrogation to hear ,  the voice of the customer is transmitted into the business with each sale and gets louder with every additional transaction 


-  The voice of the job emerges only in one-to-one ,  in-depth conversations that reveal the jobs context in  customers life ,  but listening to the voice of the customer allows the business to scale its understanding 


-  Customers can be surveyed and polled to learn their preferences ,  and those preferences are then channeled into efforts to improve existing products 


-  ,  The business unit is now no longer in the business of identifying new unmet needs but rather in the business of building processes  locking down the current model 


-  The data that surrounds managers is now about revenues ,  products ,  customers ,  and competition 


-  While in the creation phase ,  the founding team had to dig to discover data ,  data now floods the businesss offices ,  with more arriving with each new transaction 


-  Data begs to be analyzed  it is the way the game is scored  so the influx of data precipitates the adoption of metrics to evaluate the businesss performance and direct future activity to improving the metrics 


-  At this point ,  the business unit begins to prioritize the activities of efficiency innovation ,  which reduce cost by eliminating labor or by redesigning products to eliminate components or replace them with cheaper alternatives 


-  ( There is ,  however ,  always some amount of both types of innovation  sustaining and efficiency  occurring at any point of  businesss evolution 


-  )  Broadly ,  the activities of efficiency innovation include outsourcing ,  adding financial leverage ,  optimizing processes ,  and consolidating industries to gain economies of scale 


-  While many factors can cause businesses to transition into the efficiency innovation phase of their evolution ,  one we have often observed is the result of performance overshoot ,  in which the business delivers more performance than the market can utilize and consumers become unwilling to pay for additional performance improvement or to upgrade to improved versions 


-  Managers should not bemoan the shift to efficiency innovation 


-  It needs to happen; over time ,  business units must become more efficient to remain competitive ,  and the shift to efficiency innovations as the predominant form of innovation activity is  natural outcome of that process 


-  ,  To managers ,  the efficiency innovation phase marks the point where the voice of the shareholders drowns out the voice of the customer 


-  The business unit frequently achieves efficiency by shifting to  modular structure ,  standardizing the interdependencies between each of the components of its business model so that they may be outsourced to third parties 


-  In hardening these interdependencies ,  the business unit reaps the efficiency rewards of modularization but leaves flexibility behind ,  firmly cementing the structure of its business model in place 


-  Deviations from the existing structure undermine the modularity of the components and reduce efficiency ,  so when evaluating such changes ,  the business will often choose to forsake them in pursuit of greater efficiency 


-  ,  Now ,  when the business unit generates increasing amounts of free cash flow from its efficiency innovations ,  it is likely to sideline the capital ,  to diversify the company ,  or to invest it in industry consolidation 


-  Whereas the sustaining innovation phase was exciting to managers ,  customers ,  and shareholders ,  the efficiency innovation phase reduces degrees of managerial freedom 


-  Efficiency innovations lure managers with their promises of low risk ,  high returns ,  and quick paybacks from cost reduction ,  but the end result is often  race to the bottom that sees the businesss ability to serve the job and customers atrophy as it improves its service to shareholders 


-  ,  The natural evolution of business units occurs all around us 


-  Consider the case of The Boeing Co 


-  and its wildly successful 737 business unit 


-  The 737 business was announced in 1965 and launched its first version ,  the 737-100 ,  in 1967 ,  with Lufthansa as its first customer 


-  With orders from several additional major airlines ,  the new business unit demonstrated that its medium-haul plane fulfilled an important job to be done 


-  Boeing entered the sustaining innovation phase and continued to improve its product by developing several generations of new 737s ,  stretching the fuselage like an accordion while nearly doubling the planes range and more than doubling its revenue per available seat mile 


-  The business continued to improve how it served customers with the Next Generation series in the 1990s ,  which offered even bigger aircraft and better avionics systems 


-  ,  Facing increased competition and demands for improved financial performance ,  the 737 business shifted its focus to efficiency innovation in the early 2000s 


-  Outsourcing subsystem production allowed the business to improve its capital efficiency and deliver improved returns on capital 


- 10 ,  Given that road map ,  what is the hope for companies that seek to develop new business models or to create new businesses? Thus far in this article weve explored the journey that business units take over time 


-  And while were not sure that  business unit can break off from this race ,  we know that its parent companies can  by developing new businesses 


-  Although the processes of an individual business units business model propel it along this journey ,  the opportunity exists to develop  process of business creation at the corporate level 


-  But doing so successfully requires paying careful attention to the implications of the business model road map 


-  ,  Its worth internalizing the road map view of business model evolution because it helps explain why most attempts to alter the course of existing business units fail 


-  Unaware of the interdependencies and rigidities that constrain business units to pursuing their existing journey ,  managers attempt to compel existing business units to pursue new priorities or attempt to create  new business inside an existing unit 


-  Using the road map as  guiding principle allows leaders to correctly categorize the innovation opportunities that appear before them in terms of their fit with their existing business models priorities 


-  Several recommendations for managers emerge from this insight 


-  ,  Determine how consistent the opportunity is with the priorities of the existing business model 


-  The only types of innovation you can perform naturally within an existing business model are those that build on and improve the existing model and accelerate its progress along the journey  in other words ,  those innovations that are consistent with its current priorities  by sharpening its focus on fulfilling the existing job or improving its financial performance 


-  Therefore ,   crucial question for leaders to ask when evaluating an innovation opportunity is: To what degree does it align with the existing priorities of the business model? ,  Many failed business model innovations involve the pursuit of opportunities that appear to be consistent with  units current business model but that in fact are likely to be rejected by the existing business or its customers 


-  )  To determine how consistent an opportunity is with the priorities of the existing business model ,  leaders should ask: Is the new job to be done for the customer similar to the existing job?  ( The greater the similarity ,  the more appropriate it is for the existing business to pursue the opportunity 


-  If not ,  managers should tread with caution in asking an existing business to take it on  and should instead consider creating  separate unit to pursue the new business model 


-  ,  This distinction helps explain the performance of the two innovations with which we opened this article 


-  Google saw Google+ as an extension of its search business and chose to integrate Google+ into its existing products and business 


-  Google+ accounts were integrated into other Google products ,  and the business saw the incorporation of information from users social networks as  way to generate improved ,  tailored search results 


-  Viewed through the lens of Googles business model ,   social network allowed the business to generate greater revenue and profitability by better targeting advertisements and delivering more advertisements through increased usage of its product platform 


-  However ,  consumers apparently didnt see the value from combining search and social networking; to the consumer ,  the jobs are very different and arise in different circumstances in their lives 


-  So while Google maintains its exceptional search business ,  its social network failed to gain momentum 


-  ,  Contrast Googles experience to that of Daimler ,  which recognized that car2go was  very different business and established it far afield from the home office and existing business 


-  Daimler started car2go as an experiment tested by its employees working in Ulm ,  Germany 


-  It housed the business in  corporate incubator that does not report to the existing consumer automotive businesses and designed it from the outset to fulfill Daimlers core job of providing mobility ,  but without the need to convince consumers to purchase vehicles 


-  Recognizing that the priorities of  business that rents cars by the minute are very different from those involved in selling luxury vehicles ,  Daimler has kept car2go separate and allowed it to develop  unique business model capable of fulfilling its job profitably 


-  ,  To achieve successful business model innovation ,  focus on creating new business models ,  rather than changing existing ones 


-  As business model interdependencies arise ,  the ability to create new businesses within existing business units is lost 


-  The resources and processes that work so perfectly in their original business model do so because they have been honed and optimized for delivering on the priorities of that model 


-  The classic example of this was the movie rental company Blockbuster ,  which attempted to develop  new DVD-by-mail business in response to the rise of Netflix Inc 


-  by integrating that offering with its existing store network 


-  This bricks-and-clicks combination made perfect sense to Blockbusters managers ,  but what became obvious only in hindsight was that the two models would be at war with each other  the asset velocity required to maintain  profitable store network was incompatible with the DVD-by-mail offering 


-  The paradox that managers must confront is that the specialized capabilities that are highly valuable to their current business model will tend to be unsuitable for ,  or even run counter to ,  the new business model 


-  ,  For some time ,  weve argued that companies should build  business creation engine ,  capable of turning out  steady stream of innovative new business models ,  but to date no company we know of has built an enduring capability like that 


-  ,  The challenge ,  as the journey metaphor weve developed here should make clear ,  is that what is necessary is to turn an event  the act of creating  new business and  new business model  into  repeatable process at the corporate level 


-  Enacted as  process ,  the act of creation will improve over time and refine its ability to discover unfulfilled customer jobs and create new markets; the success rate will improve alongside the process ,  creating  virtuous cycle of growth 


-  ,  While we have not discovered  perfect exemplar of this discipline ,  we have been tracking the efforts of some leading companies that are intent on building such  capability 


-  Lets look at each of these approaches in turn 


-  ,  Spot future growth gaps by understanding where each of your business units is on the journey 


-  In our course at Harvard Business School ,  we teach students to use  tool called the aggregate project plan to allocate funding to different types of innovation 


- 11 Such  plan categorizes innovations by their distance from existing products and markets and specifies  desired allocation of funding to each bucket 


-  We see application for this tool here as well 


-  ,  The innovation team at Carolinas HealthCare System ,   not-for-profit health care organization based in Charlotte ,  North Carolina ,  performed this type of analysis and identified  need to field additional innovation efforts that reflected the organizations belief that hospitals will be less central in the health care system of the future 


-  Armed with this view ,  Carolinas HealthCare System has been able to plan innovation activity by type ,  ensuring that the organization invests appropriately across all three categories of the business model journey 


-  Jean Wright ,  chief innovation officer at Carolinas HealthCare System ,  said ,  The strength of the journey framework is that it allowed us to see that our investments in business creation are very different from our investments in our existing businesses 


-  More importantly ,  it has helped us see that both types are important 


-  ,  Run with potential disruptors of your business 


-  Another approach is to create incentives and channels for entrepreneurs to bring new and ,  in some cases ,  potentially disruptive business models to you ,  either as potential customers or as ecosystem partners 


-  The company achieved this ubiquity by inviting customers and consumers into its development process so that it will be the first company called by customers seeking to design  new chip 


-  It does this in two ways: first ,  by incorporating knowledge across its entire ecosystem that allows it to develop optimized end-to-end solutions for customers ,  and second ,  by employing  royalty-based revenue model that ensures ARMs incentives are aligned with those of its customers 


-  ,  Start new businesses by exploring the job to be done 


-  When identifying new market opportunities ,  its critical that you begin with  focus on the customers job to be done ,  rather than on your companys capabilities 


-  Its tempting to look at your capabilities as the starting point for any expansion ,  but capabilities are of no use without  job for them 


-  When it becomes apparent that  Corning business can no longer generate  premium price from its technical superiority  when it reaches the efficiency innovation stage ,  in our framework  the company divests that business and uses the proceeds to expand businesses in the sustaining stage and to create new ones 


-  For example ,  when Corning realized that liquid crystal display  ( LCD )  would eventually replace cathode ray tube  ( CRT )  technology to become the future of display ,  the company focused on the job to be done  display  rather than just on the CRT market ,  which at the time was important to the company 


-  Corning began inventing products to enable the growth of the LCD industry and eventually decided to exit the CRT market 


- 12 To Corning ,  businesses serve needs ,  not markets ,  and as technological or market shifts occur ,  the company continues to grow by remaining focused on the need ,  which we call the job 


-  ,  Resist the urge to force new businesses to find homes in existing units 


-  When executives start new businesses ,  they often look at them and wonder ,  Where do  stick this in my organization? They feel pressure to combine new businesses with existing structures to maximize efficiency and spread overhead costs over the widest base ,  but this can spell doom for the new business 


-  When  new business is housed within an existing unit ,  it must adopt the priorities of the existing business to secure funding; in doing so ,  the new business often survives in name but disappears in effect 


-  ,  Once  new business is launched ,  it must remain independent throughout the duration of its journey ,  but maintaining autonomy requires ongoing leadership attention 


-  The forces of efficiency operate 24/7 inside an organization ,  rooting out any cost perceived to be superfluous; standing against these forces requires the constant application of  counterforce that only the companys most senior leaders can provide 


-  In the quest for efficiency ,  what has been somehow forgotten is the vital leadership role that corporate executives can play in fostering organizational innovation by countenancing the creation of multiple profit formulas and housing these different businesses in  portfolio of business models 


-  ,  Use M&A to create internal business model disruption and renewal 


-  Lastly ,  while weve focused most of our attention on organic activities ,  theres  very valuable role for M&A in  business growth engine 


- 13 Although at the extreme ,  this approach can result in  quasi-conglomerate structure that history has proved to be ineffective ,  there are exceptions 


-  ,   company it had acquired three years earlier ,  as  publicly traded subsidiary in 2007 


-  Much M&A activity designed to change an existing business model fails because its done for the wrong reasons and managed in the wrong way ,  often resulting in the integration of units that should remain autonomous 


-  In contrast ,  EMCs federation structure allows each business to pursue its individual objectives while coordinating the companys activity as  whole 


-  This embedded capability for exploiting existing markets while identifying and investing in new markets allowed EMC to expand out of its traditional memory business into machine virtualization ,  agile development ,  and information security 


-  ,  Executives sometimes prefer to invest in their existing businesses because those investments seem less risky than trying to create entirely new businesses 


-  But our understanding of the business model journey allows us to see that ,  over the long term ,  the greatest innovation risk  company can take is to decide not to create new businesses that decouple the companys future from that of its current business units 


-  ,  We take great hope from the insights about business model innovation and corporate renewal that we have explored in this article  not because we believe that business units can evade or escape the journey that we have described ,  but because we believe that the corporations that house these units can 


-  There remains much to be learned about corporate renewal and the business model journey ,  but we hope that insights from the business model road map can help companies learn how to create robust corporate-level business creation engines that will renew their organizations and power growth 


-  ,   Netherlands-based developer of security software for digital media providers ,  was eager to increase its market share in the Asian market 


-  The company had been in China for nearly  decade and boasted  substantial regional office in Beijing 


-  But its market share in China was under attack from Chinese competitors ,  including China Digital TV ,  which held  40% market share compared to Irdetos 22% 


-  Despite frequent visits by then-CEO Graham Kill and the sales director ,  the company worried that it would miss out on the anticipated market growth in China and other parts of Asia 


-  ,  In Kills view ,  one of Irdetos problems was that too much power was concentrated in the head office in the Netherlands 


-  Managers there conducted themselves as if they knew best ,  and branch offices and subsidiaries tended to defer to Amsterdam 


-  ,  In our experience ,  similar narrow-mindedness holds back many organizations in their efforts to turn global presence into  real source of competitive advantage 


-  In this article ,  we explore the manifestations and costs associated with this way of thinking  and ways companies have addressed the problem 


-  Many of the things companies have done are fairly predictable ,  such as decentralizing global responsibilities ,  changing the reporting relationships ,  internationalizing senior management ,  and creating cross-national teams 


-  While this was expensive  and something Kills successor ultimately did away with in 2015  our study of the company indicated that the decision to operate out of dual headquarters provided an effective way to realign the focus of the company ,  and it had significant positive effects on Irdetos performance 


-  )  We offer  broad set of recommendations to help executives overcome the headquarters knows best syndrome and position themselves more effectively for global growth 


-  Many managers have no trouble ticking off the symptoms ,  including unrealistic demands from headquarters ,  misguided advice or directives ,  micromanagement ,  and  lack of receptiveness to subsidiary contributions and ideas 


-  At subsidiaries ,  these behaviors lead to  loss of confidence or initiative ,  defensiveness ,  reluctance to share information ,  rivalry for headquarters attention ,  and careful impression management during visits from headquarters executives 


-  Sometimes they are even intimidated ,  [and this] leads to suboptimal use of their potential 


-  Among other things ,  it results in missed sales leads ,  the loss of talented employees working in subsidiaries due to  lack of career advancement opportunities ,  an overinvestment in initiatives that are close to the headquarters ,  and an underinvestment in innovation and entrepreneurship in far-off markets 


-  ,  Our surveys of more than 500 executives working in the subsidiaries of multinational corporations reveal that most endure  domineering headquarters 


-  Typically ,  they interact with executives from subsidiaries that are closest to headquarters  ( in terms of geography ,  economic development ,  and culture )  their frame of reference is based on subsidiary managers who benefit from ample attention ,  autonomy ,  or influence 


-  ,  To counteract the centralizing force of strong home-country headquarters and develop more global mindsets ,   number of multinationals have tested solutions that attempt to change one or more of the following: ,  Such strategies may be effective in some settings ,  but Kill and other Irdeto executives felt they were not adequate for addressing their companys problem 


-  However ,  such efforts had limited impact 


-  His decision was to split the top management team between Amsterdam and Beijing 


-  In practice ,  head offices are often bastions of conservatism ,  advocating innovation everywhere but at the corporate headquarters 


-  Hence ,  we still know little about the workability of such arrangements 


-  ,  Over  five-year period ,  Irdeto took several steps to implement the dual headquarters arrangement 


-  Aside from the relocation costs ,  the other expenses were relatively minor 


-  From  management perspective ,  the company didnt have to revamp the formal reporting lines or management systems ,  although it did institute important changes in work practices to create  better balance between Europe and Asia 


-  The changes involved three things: ,  We tracked the changes in Irdetos activities closely 


-  After the company established its dual headquarters in 2007 ,  our surveys and interviews revealed measurable improvements on four fronts: increased top management attention ,  greater subsidiary contributions ,  rich lateral exchanges ,  and tighter local connections 


-  This culminated in the announcement in 2010 that the company would locate its formal center of excellence for software development in Beijing 


-  Beyond these high-profile decisions ,  people inside the company noticed more responsiveness to developments in Asia 


-  As one Asian middle manager commented ,  Now [with the CEO in Beijing] we can get prompt decisions and feedback from the senior management team 


-  ,  Because the structural change improved communication channels ,  the senior leadership team interacted more often with Asian managers 


-  Executives in surrounding countries  notably Korea ,  Singapore ,  and Thailand  reported significant gains in senior management attention 


-  As top managers interacted more with Asian executives ,  the top managers were more likely to appreciate the efforts made ,  obstacles overcome ,  and deals won 


-  Increased credibility generated greater trust ,  which ,  in turn ,  expanded the units influence and ability to make important contributions to strategic decisions 


-  Said one European IT manager ,  We have started to see  real shift in how the team in Beijing works 


-  They are pushing back more in development projects  This wont work in the Asian market 


-  Have you tried that? ,  Within three years ,  the Amsterdam and Beijing offices were operating more or less as equals 


-  For example ,  the group human resources director noted ,  The increased presence in Beijing  especially the center of excellence  has given employees the feeling that they are part of one global organization ,  rather than one managed out of  single place 


-  ,  Horizontal ties among peers across subsidiaries improved markedly 


-  Suddenly ,  Asian executives gained easy access to boundary spanners  people who could connect them to networks in subsidiaries around the world 


-  And as network connections increased ,  Asia  ( particularly China )  became more central to communication flows 


-  In the words of an Asia-based business development manager ,  The dual-core [headquarters] simply recognizes the way we work in  multicultural ,  multi-time-zone world 


-  It created  more integrated and efficient organization  one with more connections and tighter links 


-  ,  Irdetos strategy also led to improved communications with the outside world and improved perceptions about the company 


-  Our findings show that it generated more interactions with Chinese customers and ,  thanks largely to the presence of senior leadership team members ,  closer relationships with Chinese business partners 


-  The fact that Irdeto had two headquarters ,  combined with the CEOs move to Beijing ,  made  strong statement about Irdetos priorities to employees ,  customers ,  prospects ,  suppliers ,  investors ,  and other external stakeholders 


-  Several China-based interviewees remarked that the company had started to become part of the local fabric 


-   key area that improved was Irdetos relationship with local officials 


-  As Kill noted ,  Being able to drop everything and show up immediately has been very helpful in managing our relationship with the government 


-  Irdetos commitment to the Asian market also improved its relations with local universities ,  resulting in new internships and joint research programs 


-  ,  Significantly ,  Irdetos gains in Asia did not come at the expense of its business in Europe 


-  In fact ,  European executives benefited in two ways: The move enhanced the companys reputation for innovation among its European stakeholders ,  and Kills move to China pushed managers in Amsterdam to take increased responsibility for decisions ,  especially those that didnt really warrant the CEOs attention 


-  However ,  we can report that the companys revenues tripled during the four years we actively studied it ,  increasing from $70 million in 2007 to $215 million in 2011 


-  But our research indicates that two-thirds of the growth was organic ,  driven mainly by positive perceptions about the company and by its pursuit of new opportunities worldwide; Asia sales grew by 94% in 2008 ,  36% in 2009 ,  and 70% in 2010 


-  The following year the company ,  in an effort to integrate the North American acquisitions  ( which represented more than  third of its sales and employees )  ,  decided to add  third headquarters in San Francisco and to add three executives based there to the senior leadership team 


-  We were surprised by the response 


-  Most said they didnt regard it as either two-headed or three-headed but rather as  virtual headquarters led by senior managers who worked from different locations 


-  As  result ,  people said the company was able to make more effective resource-allocation decisions informed by diverse thinking and divergent points of view 


-  In 2014 ,  after eight years in Beijing ,  Kill left the company in order to move back to Great Britain 


-  He was confident that the changes were sufficiently anchored that they would not be threatened by this move 


-  Lowther is  Canadian ,  with extensive experience of working in North America ,  Asia ,  and several parts of Europe 


-  In many ways ,  he embodies the new global perspective of the company 


-  ,  Our discussions with both the previous and current management teams at Irdeto suggest that adding another headquarters served as  catalyst for breaking the domineering mindset within Irdeto and enabled it to grow in Asia 


-  ,  The recent changes are  reminder that there is no perfect structure 


-  Although the major benefits of the dual-core headquarters had been realized by 2014 in the form of changing mindsets and new ways of working ,  the coordination costs were still present 


-  It is  reminder that there often is  natural cycle to these types of structural changes ,  and we should not expect any model to last forever 


-  ,  Irdeto is  medium-sized ,  privately owned multinational corporation  and what works for one company may not be right for another 


-  Nevertheless ,  Irdetos experience offers some broad lessons for companies seeking to eliminate their local biases and become more global 


-  ,  Redistributing headquarters activities and reassigning top executives to other locations is the fastest ,  most effective organizational lever management has 


-  In less than  year ,  Irdeto saw  significant increase in the stature ,  influence ,  and centrality of the Asia market ,  which had previously been marginalized 


-  Social psychology has shown that behavior change is often  precondition for changes in attitudes and feelings 


-  People tend to act their way into new attitudes more than they think their way into new behaviors 


-  To change attitudes ,  therefore ,  companies must create new patterns of interaction rather than just relying on training and development 


-  ,  The perception of fairness is critical to reducing resistance to painful change 


-  One reason many restructuring efforts flounder is that they demand sacrifice from everyone except those at the top 


-  To succeed ,  the senior management must accept its share of the pain 


-  It wouldnt have been right for me to say to my colleagues ,  Look ,   want you to go over to China to start this initiative ,  Kill said 


-  ,  Another aspect of fairness is managing the trepidation associated with change 


-  At Irdeto ,  it was clear from the outset that some executives didnt want to participate in the program because of the intensive travel and mobility demands 


-  For those unwilling to change ,  it was important to manage the necessary transitions in  fair way; there was total clarity on the impending changes and time horizon ,  but also  chance to adapt ,  get reassigned ,  or exit with dignity  ( with outplacement assistance )  


- 11 ,  Decisive ,  top-down leadership is sometimes necessary to produce lasting change 


-  Fair processes can help render these difficult outcomes more palatable by making the case for change and engaging reluctant participants in discussions about how to achieve it and mitigate the downsides 


-  Allen showed that interaction frequency in an R&D setting declined substantially with distance  ( for example ,  colleagues on separate floors seldom interacted informally )  


-  Advances in communication technologies have done little to change this 


-  Ironically ,  virtual communication occurs most often between colleagues who frequently meet face to face 


-  With less spontaneous interaction ,  leadership teams located in different places must change how they operate 


-  Executives must make  conscious effort to connect with others regularly ,  often by scheduling appointments that span multiple time zones 


-  Its all too easy for the top team to neglect interactions and get swamped by the operational side of managing the business 


-  If meeting times arent set in advance and respected ,  the demands of the moment invariably win out 


-  Because we are so dispersed ,  we need to work hard on alignment and priorities 


-  As  result ,  its harder for everyone to fully understand the topics under discussion ,  and participants tend to judge each other more harshly 


-  ,  Companies today must use their global reach to learn from their partners in far-flung locations and to recycle that learning globally 


-  Instead of emphasizing where  company operates ,  we are now more concerned with how it manages and structures its worldwide activities 


-  They are investing heavily to meet short-term growth targets instead of developing new business models and innovations that will help them compete across their entire network
