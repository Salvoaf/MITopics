-  No one has to teach an infant to walk ,  or talk ,  or master the spatial relationships needed to stack eight building blocks that dont topple 


-  ,  Our prevailing system of management has destroyed our people ,  writes  


-  People are born with intrinsic motivation ,  self-esteem ,  dignity ,  curiosity to learn ,  joy in learning 


-  The forces of destruction begin with toddlers   prize for the best Halloween costume ,  grades in school ,  gold stars ,  and on up through the university 


-  On the job ,  people ,  teams ,  divisions are ranked  reward for the one at the top ,  punishment at the bottom 


-  MBO quotas ,  incentive pay ,  business plans ,  put together separately ,  division by division ,  cause further loss ,  unknown and unknowable 


-  ,  Ironically ,  by focusing on performing for someone elses approval ,  corporations create the very conditions that predestine them to mediocre performance 


-  Over the long run ,  superior performance depends on superior learning 


-  On the other hand ,  de Geus and his colleagues at Shell also found  small number of companies that survived for seventy-five years or longer 


-  Interestingly ,  the key to their survival was the ability to run experiments in the margin ,  to continually explore new business and organizational opportunities that create potential new sources of growth 


-  ,  If anything ,  the need for understanding how organizations learn and accelerating that learning is greater today than ever before 


-  While the challenge is great ,  so is the potential payoff 


-  The person who figures out how to harness the collective genius of the people in his or her organization ,  according to former Citibank CEO Walter Wriston ,  is going to blow the competition away 


-  ,  The prevailing view of learning organizations emphasizes increased adaptability 


-  Given the accelerating pace of change ,  or so the standard view goes ,  the most successful corporation of the 1990s ,  according to Fortune magazine ,  will be something called  learning organization ,   consummately adaptive enterprise 


-  As the Shell study shows ,  examples of traditional authoritarian bureaucracies that responded too slowly to survive in changing business environments are legion 


-  The impulse to learn ,  at its heart ,  is an impulse to be generative ,  to expand our capability 


-  This is why leading corporations are focusing on generative learning ,  which is about creating ,  as well as adaptive learning ,  which is about coping 


-  With its emphasis on continuous expenmentation and feedback ,  the total quality movement has been the first wave in building learning organizations 


-  But Japanese firms view of serving the customer has evolved 


-  In the early years of total quality ,  the focus was on fitness to standard ,  making  product reliably so that it would do what its designers intended it to do and what the firm told its customers it would do 


-  Then came  focus on fitness to need ,  understanding better what the customer wanted and then providing products that reliably met those needs 


-  Today ,  leading edge firms seek to understand and meet the latent need of the customerwhat customers might truly value but have never experienced or would never think to ask for 


-  It required  leap of imagination to see what the customer might want 


-  ,  Generative learning ,  unlike adaptive learning ,  requires new ways of looking at the world ,  whether in understanding customers or in understanding how to better manage  business 


-  manufacturers sought competitive advantage in aggressive controls on inventories ,  incentives against overproduction ,  and rigid adherence to production forecasts 


-  Despite these incentives ,  their performance was eventually eclipsed by Japanese firms who saw the challenges of manufacturing differently 


-  They realized that eliminating delays in the production process was the key to reducing instability and improving cost ,  productivity ,  and service 


-  They worked to build networks of relationships with trusted suppliers and to redesign physical production processes so as to reduce delays in materials procurement ,  production set up ,  and in-process inventory   much higher-leverage approach to improving both cost and customer loyalty 


-  ,  As Boston Consulting Groups George Stalk has observed ,  the Japanese saw the significance of delays because they saw the process of order entry ,  production scheduling ,  materials procurement ,  production ,  and distribution as an integrated system 


-  ,  I talk with people all over the country about learning organizations ,  and the response is always very positive ,  says William OBrien ,  CEO of the Hanover Insurance companies 


-  If this type of organization is so widely preferred ,  why dont people create such organizations?  think the answer is leadership 


-  ,  Our traditional view of leaders  as special people who set the direction ,  make the key decisions ,  and energize the troops  is deeply rooted in an individualistic and nonsystemic worldview 


-  So long as such myths prevail ,  they reinforce  focus on short-term events and charismatic heroes rather than on systemic forces and collective learning 


-  In  learning organization ,  leaders roles differ dramatically from that of the charismatic decision maker 


-  These roles require new skills: the ability to build shared vision ,  to bring to the surface and challenge prevailing mental models ,  and to foster more systemic patterns of thinking 


-  In short ,  leaders in learning organizations are responsible for building organizations where people are continually expanding their capabilities to shape their future  that is ,  leaders are responsible for learning 


-  create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism 


-  They believe that ,  if only people understood current reality ,  they would surely feel the motivation to change 


-  They are then disappointed to discover that people resist the personal and organizational changes that must be made to alter reality 


-  What they never grasp is that the natural energy for changing reality comes from holding  picture of what might be that is more important to people than what is 


-  Many people and organizations find themselves motivated to change only when their problems are bad enough to cause them to change 


-  With problem solving ,  the motivation for change is extrinsic 


-  With creative tension ,  the motivation is intrinsic 


-  What is your role? ,   have asked this question of groups of managers many times 


-  While these are legitimate leadership roles ,  there is another which ,  in many ways ,  eclipses them all in importance 


-  The consequences that appear today are the result of work done long in the past ,  and work today will show its benefits far in the future 


-  The first task of organization design concerns designing the governing ideas of purpose ,  vision ,  and core values by which people will live 


-  Few acts of leadership have  more enduring impact on an organization than building  foundation of purpose and core values 


-  ,  In 1982 ,  Johnson  Johnson found itself facing  corporate nightmare when bottles of its best-selling Tylenol were tampered with ,  resulting in several deaths 


-  Although the immediate cost was significant ,  no other action was possible given the firms credo 


-  Authored almost forty years earlier by president Robert Wood Johnson ,  Johnson  Johnsons credo states that permanent success is possible only when modern industry realizes that: ,  Such statements might seem like motherhood and apple pie to those who have not seen the way  clear sense of purpose and values can affect key business decisions 


-  Johnson  Johnsons crisis management in this case was based on that credo 


-  ,  If governing ideas constitute the first design task of leadership ,  the second design task involves the policies ,  strategies ,  and structures that translate guiding ideas into business decisions 


- 11 Policy making  ( the rules that guide decisions )  ought to be separated from decision making ,  says Jay Forrester 


-  ,  Traditionally ,  writers like Selznick and Forrester have tended to see policy making and implementation as the work of  small number of senior managers 


-  Both the dynamic business environment and the mandate of the learning organization to engage people at all levels now make it clear that this second design task is more subtle 


-  Successful organizations craft strategy according to Mintzberg ,  as they continually learn about shifting business conditions and balance what is desired and what is possible 


-  The choice of individual action is only part of  


-  the policymakers need ,  according to Mason and Mitroff 


- 14 More important is the need to achieve insight into the nature of the complexity and to formulate concepts and world views for coping with it 


-  Around 1971 ,  members of Shells Group Planning in London began to foresee dramatic change and unpredictability in world oil markets 


-  ,  As they pondered this failure ,  the planners view of their basic task shifted: We no longer saw our task as producing  documented view of the future business environment five or ten years ahead 


-  Our real target was the microcosm  ( the mental model )  of our decision makers 


-  It mattered not that the managers believed the planners scenarios absolutely ,  only that they became engaged in ferreting out the implications 


-  In this way ,  Shells planners conditioned managers to be mentally prepared for  shift from low prices to high prices and from stability to instability 


-  The results were significant 


-  When OPEC became  reality ,  Shell quickly responded by increasing local operating company control  ( to enhance maneuverability in the new political environment )  ,  building buffer stocks ,  and accelerating development of non-OPEC sources  actions that its competitors took much more slowly or not at all 


-  ,  Somewhat inadvertently ,  Shell planners had discovered the leverage of designing institutional learning processes ,  whereby ,  in the words of former planning director de Geus ,  Management teams change their shared mental models of their company ,  their markets ,  and their competitors 


- 17 Much of the leverage leaders can actually exert lies in helping people achieve more accurate ,  more insightful ,  and more empowering views of reality 


-  ,  Leader as teacher does not mean leader as authoritarian expert whose job it is to teach people the correct view of reality 


- 18 In learning organizations ,  this teaching role is developed further by virtue of explicit attention to peoples mental models and by the influence of the systems perspective 


-  ,  The role of leader as teacher starts with bringing to the surface peoples mental models of important issues 


-  These mental pictures of how the world works have  significant influence on how we perceive problems and opportunities ,  identify courses of action ,  and make choices 


-  Styling is therefore more important than quality19 The Detroit automakers didnt say ,  We have  mental model that all people care about is styling 


-  Few actual managers would even say publicly that all people care about is styling 


-  Reality ,  as perceived by most people in most organizations ,  means pressures that must be borne ,  crises that must be reacted to ,  and limitations that must be accepted 


-  Leaders as teachers help people restructure their views of reality to see beyond the superficial conditions and events into the underlying causes of problems  and therefore to see new possibilities for shaping the future 


-  ,  Specifically ,  leaders can influence people to view reality at three distinct levels: events ,  patterns of behavior ,  and systemic structure 


-  ,  The key question becomes where do leaders predominantly focus their own and their organizations attention? ,  Contemporary society focuses predominantly on events 


-  The media reinforces this perspective ,  with almost exclusive attention to short-term ,  dramatic events 


-  This focus leads naturally to explaining what happens in terms of those events: The Dow Jones average went up sixteen points because high fourth-quarter profits were announced yesterday 


-  Systemic ,  structural explanations go even further by addressing the question ,  What causes the patterns of behavior? ,  In some sense ,  all three levels of explanation are equally true 


-  Pattern-of-behavior explanations focus on identifying long-term trends and assessing their implications 


-  ,  By and large ,  leaders of our current institutions focus their attention on events and patterns of behavior ,  and ,  under their influence ,  their organizations do likewise 


-  On the other hand ,  leaders in learning organizations pay attention to all three levels ,  but focus especially on systemic structure; largely by example ,  they teach people throughout the organization to do likewise 


-  This conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead 


-  That person is sharply different from one who is leader first ,  perhaps because of the need to assuage an unusual power drive or to acquire material possessions 


-  ,  Leaders sense of stewardship operates on two levels: stewardship for the people they lead and stewardship for the larger purpose or mission that underlies the enterprise 


-  If anything ,  people in  learning organization are more vulnerable because of their commitment and sense of shared ownership 


-  They are part of changing the way businesses operate ,  not from  vague philanthropic urge ,  but from  conviction that their efforts will produce more productive organizations ,  capable of achieving higher levels of organizational success and personal satisfaction than more traditional organizations 


-  Likewise ,  when  group of people come to share  vision for an organization ,  each person sees an individual picture of the organization at its best 


-  Its something like poking holes in  window shade; each hole offers  unique angle for viewing the whole image 


-  ,  When you add up the pieces of  hologram ,  something interesting happens 


-  When more people come to share  vision ,  the vision becomes more real in the sense of  mental reality that people can truly imagine achieving 


-  Early on ,  when they are nurturing an individual vision ,  people may say it is my vision 


-  ,  The skills involved in building shared vision include the following: ,  Many of the best ideas in organizations never get put into practice 


- 23 ,  Specifically ,  when advocating  view ,  they need to be able to: ,  When inquiring into anothers views ,  they need to: ,  If they reach an impasse  ( others no longer appear open to inquiry )  ,  they need to: ,  The first challenge is to recognize defensive routines ,  then to inquire into their operation 


-  Can you help me see this better? )  ,  We all know that leaders should help people see the big picture 


-  They focus less on day-to-day events and more on underlying trends and forces of change 


-  ,  One of the most significant developments in management science today is the gradual coalescence of managerial systems thinking as  field of study and practice 


-  Gore and Associates  ( makers of GoreTex and other synthetic fiber products )  


-  Bill Gore was adept at telling stories that showed how the organizations core values of freedom and individual responsibility required particular operating policies 


-  He was proud of his egalitarian organization ,  in which there were  ( and still are )  no employees ,  only associates ,  all of whom own shares in the company and participate in its management 


-  At one talk ,  he explained the companys policy of controlled growth: Our limitation is not financial resources 


-  He suggests that ,  at larger rates of growth ,  the adverse effects of attempting to integrate too many new people too rapidly would begin to dominate 


-  )  The story also reaffirms the organizations commitment to creating  unique environment for its associates and illustrates the types of sacrifices that the firm is prepared to make in order to remain true to its vision 


-  The last part of the story shows that ,  despite the self-imposed limit ,  the company is still very much  growth company 


-  Eventually ,  the worldview of people in the organization becomes dominated by events and reactiveness 


-  Ironically ,  they often end up being authoritarian leaders ,  even if they dont want to ,  because only they see the decisions that need to be made 


- 25 ,  Some of the system archetypes that have the broadest relevance include: ,  The Archetype template is  specific tool that is helping managers identify archetypes operating in their own strategic areas  ( see Figure  )  


-  The problem they focused on was financial stress ,  which could be dealt with in two different ways: by running marketing promotions  ( the symptomatic solution )  or by product innovation  ( the fundamental solution )  


-  The company was expert in their design and implementation 


-  The results were highly predictable 


-  Product innovation was slow and much less predictable ,  and the company had  history over the past ten years of product-innovation mismanagement 


-  What the managers saw clearly was that the more skillful they became at promotions ,  the more they shifted the burden away from product innovation 


-  Unless the political values shifted back toward product and process innovation ,  the managers realized ,  the firms decline would accelerate  which is just the shift that has happened over the past several years 


-  manufacturers faced the low cost-high quality choice 


-  Not surprisingly ,  given the short-term pressures perceived by most managements ,  the prevailing choice was low cost 


-  The consequences of this perceived either-or choice have been disastrous ,  even fatal ,  as  


-  manufacturers have encountered increasing international competition from firms that have chosen to consistently improve quality and cost 


-  ,  In  recent book ,  Charles Hampden-Turner presented  variety of tools for helping management teams confront strategic dilemmas creatively 


- 28 He summarizes the process in seven steps: ,  The idea that mental models can dominate business decisions and that these models are often tacit and even contradictory to what people espouse can be very threatening to managers who pride themselves on rationality and judicious decision making 


-  ,  When working with managers ,   start this exercise by selecting  specific situation in which  am interacting with other people in  way that is not working ,  that is not producing the learning that is needed 


-  Believing that he lacks confidence ,   skirt the fact that Ive heard the presentation was  bomb 


-  When  ask Bill what we should do next ,  he gives no specific course of action 


-  Believing he lacks initiative ,   take this as evidence of his laziness; he is content to do nothing when action is definitely required 


-   conclude that  will have to manufacture some form of pressure to motivate him ,  or else  will simply have to take matters into my own hands 


-  But the price of avoiding the issue is high 


-  Instead of determining how to move forward to resolve our problems ,  we end our exchange with no clear course of action 


-   resort to  manipulative strategy to move things forward 


-  ,  The exercise not only reveals the need for skills in surfacing assumptions ,  but that we are the ones most in need of help 


-  There is no one right way to handle difficult situations like my exchange with Bill ,  but any productive strategy revolves around  high level of self-disclosure and willingness to have my views challenged 


-   need to recognize my own leaps of abstraction regarding Bill ,  share the events and reasoning that are leading to my concern over the project ,  and be open to Bills views on both 


-  See The Left-Hand Column: An Exercise ,  One of the most promising new tools is the learning laboratory or microworld: constructed microcosms of real-life settings in which management teams can learn how to learn together 


-  Although most management teams have great difficulty learning  ( enhancing their collective intelligence and capacity to create )  ,  in other domains team learning is the norm rather than the exception  team sports and the performing arts ,  for example 


-  The process is  continual movement between practice and performance 


-  ,  The vision guiding current research in management learning laboratories is to design and construct effective practice fields for management teams 


-  ,  First ,  since team learning in organizations is an individual-to-individual and individual-to-system phenomenon ,  learning laboratories must combine meaningful business issues with meaningful interpersonal dynamics 


-  ,  Second ,  the factors that thwart learning about complex business issues must be eliminated in the learning lab 


-  Chief among these is the inability to experience the long-term ,  systemic consequences of key strategic decisions 


-  We all learn best from experience ,  but we are unable to experience the consequences of many important organizational decisions 


-  One constraint on learning is the inability of managers to reflect insightfully on their assumptions and to inquire effectively into each others assumptions 


-  Both skills can be enhanced in  learning laboratory ,  where people can practice surfacing assumptions in  low-risk setting 


-   note of caution: It is far easier to design an entertaining learning laboratory than it is to have an impact on real management practices and firm traditions outside the learning lab 


-  Research on management simulations has shown that they often have greater entertainment value than educational value 


-  One of the reasons appears to be that many simulations do not offer deep insights into systemic structures causing business problems 


-  Warner Burke observe the return of an emphasis on developing leaders who can develop organizations 


-  The 1990s may be the period ,  suggest Sashkin and Burke ,  during which organization development and  (  new sort of )  management development are reconnected 


-  ,   believe that this new sort of management development will focus on the roles ,  skills ,  and tools for leadership in learning organizations 


-  Undoubtedly ,  the ideas offered above are only  rough approximation of this new territory
