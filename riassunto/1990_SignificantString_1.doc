-  Individuals are always centrally involved ,  but the definition of the client can get very complicated 


-  ,  In fact ,  the systemic approach requires one to think simultaneously in terms of three clients: immediate or contact clients with whom one is interacting in the here and now; primary clients ,  who are the real targets of change ,  and who pay for the change efforts; and ultimate clients ,  who are the stakeholders that must be considered even though one might not ever interact with them directly 


-  ,   make this point at the outset because process consultation has been stereotyped as something one does primarily with small groups 


-  My own experience is that one works on  daily basis with individuals ,  small groups ,  or large groups ,  but that ones concerns are always systemic in the sense that one considers immediate interventions in terms of their consequences for other parts of the system 


-  My back-ground was in social and clinical psychology ,  and  had  chance to see these roles in operation while working from 1952 to 1956 in the Neuropsychiatry Division of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research under David Rioch 


-  ,   learned  lot about how an effective group should operate ,  and  also learned that to make  group more effective  could not simply advise it 


-   had to find  way to make the data visible ,  so that the group could learn from its own experience 


-  The essential skill of the trainer was to make observations in such  way that the group could learn from them ,   model not unlike the psychoanalytic group model being proposed by Bion at the time and used by the  


-  ,  Given this background ,   approached my first organizational consulting with models of effective interpersonal relations and group behavior in mind ,  and with an armamentarium of observational and intervention skills in my tool bag 


-   was fortunate in 1965 to have the opportunity to work with the top management team of  young high-tech company 


-  My explicit mandate was to help the group with communication and to make them more effective as an executive team 


-  The managers were very confrontational ,  constantly interrupted each other ,  often shouted at each other ,  revealed information of  negative sort about each other at the meetings ,  blamed each other ,  and in other ways behaved ineffectively 


-  Their response was always one of interest 


-  In other words ,  nothing changed 


-   was also imposing  set of humanistic values pertaining to how people should communicate ,  how they should not publicly embarrass each other ,  and how they should reach consensus on decisions 


-  ,  In letting those assumptions guide me ,   was missing  crucial pointthe group had an agenda more important than all of the above considerations 


-  Specifically ,  the agenda was to resolve critical strategic issues around choices of technology and products in an industry where no one really knew what would and would not work ,  and where the academic traditionthat ideas had to be fought out in order to be tested and validated prevailed 


-   was busy trying to civilize the group ,  while the group was searching for truth in  life and death struggle against its competitors 


-   was imposing my expertise about groups on  group trying to solve  problem far more important than how to be an effective group 


-  But  eventually realized that they themselves did not know exactly what they had in mind 


-  They only knew that some-thing was wrong ,  and they were counting on me to help fix it 


-  ,  In retrospect ,  the essence of what  came to think of later as process consultation was derived from the insight that  could not be helpful until  gave up my own notion of what the group should be and began to pay attention to what the group was actually trying to do 


-  ,  My learning process was aided by one fact: This executive group violated most of my preconceptions ,  yet was enormously successful in running their business 


-  Obviously ,  something was lacking in my own theories 


-  ,  As  began to see what the group was trying to do ,  and as my curiosity overrode my need to be helpful ,   actually became more helpful 


-  Instead of focusing on the dysfunctional aspects of interrupting ,   began to focus on the idea that was being cut off 


-   began to intervene in the real process of the group ,  its task process ,  and allowed myself to get preoccupied with interpersonal issues only when there was time ,   clear need to deal with them ,  and  readiness on the part of the group to do so 


-  ,   knew  was on to something ,  but the clearer articulation of what lay behind these insights was only later forced upon me by  colleague who perceived management consulting to be  waste of time 


-  The helper has to make on-line choices about which model to use from moment to moment 


-  The client wants to know how the workers in  given plant feel about something and asks the consultant to do  survey to find out 


-   subordinate asks the boss: How do  deal with this problem employee in my group? and the boss tells her how 


-  ,  This seems straightforward enough ,  but notice that the model makes several assumptions that often cannot be met 


-  It assumes that the client knows what the problem is ,  that the client has communicated the real problem ,  that the helper has the needed information ,  and that the client has thought through the consequences of asking the question and receiving the answer 


-  ,  It may be that doing the survey will raise expectations that the manager is not prepared to deal with 


-  ,  Sometimes the helperthe consultant ,  the manager ,  or the parentmust think about these assumptions and assess the consequences of providing expert information 


-  Yet to recognize that one may not be as expert as one assumed ,  or that the client may not really benefit from ones knowledge ,  is extremely difficult 


-  ,  Clients often invite helpers to be ,  in effect ,   doctor: to investigate ,  interview ,  psychologically assess ,  run tests ,  make  diagnosis ,  and suggest  cure 


-  If consultants find that model one is an ego trip ,  think how we respond to model two 


-  For example ,  the organizational client wants us to investigate whats wrong in  department and suggest  cure; the subordinate goes to the boss with  broad request for diagnostic help in dealing with problem people; or the child comes to the parent with the lament that he cant ever do the math and doesnt know whats wrong 


-  (  have often found that my data was invalid because  grateful client exaggerated the problems ,  or  resentful client denied them completely 


-  ,  We are all frequently frustrated in our helping efforts by clients who do not accept our expertise ,  who file our reports instead of acting on them ,  who misunderstand and subvert our recommendations ,  or who revert to their disease the minute we leave 


-  As an aside ,   might comment that this last condition may not bother us as consultants inasmuch as it keeps us employed ,  but in fact if the patient becomes too dependent ,  we are no longer consulting or helping 


-  We become de facto managers wearing consultant hats 


-  Incidentally ,  physicians are themselves questioning this model as they observe their own patients resisting diagnosis or prescriptions and as those prescriptions themselves become more complex 


-  ,  That brings us to the philosophy  have labeled process consultation and to  set of assumptions that seem to better fit human systems with which we typically deal 


-  They know something is wrong but the help they really need is in figuring out exactly what that is 


-  Once that question has been answered ,  they can often figure out their own solution 


-  ,  Third ,   assume that many problems in human systems are such that clients would benefit from participation in the diagnosing processparticularly since they are so often part of the problem and need to be led to this insight 


-  ,  Fifth ,   assume that clients have constructive intent and will benefit from the process of learning how to solve problems ,  so that future problems can be dealt with more effectively 


-  ,  What these assumptions mean is that helpers must suspend most of their own biases initially; they must develop  mutual inquiry process that not only creates  shared sense of responsibility for figuring out what is wrong and how to fix it ,  but also enables helpers to pass on some of their own diagnostic and intervention skills 


-  ,  Another way of making this point is to note that ,  in the expert or doctor model ,  the consultant allows and even encourages the client to pass his or her presumed problem on to the consultant 


-  Once the helper has accepted the problem and the responsibility to do something ,  the client can relax and wait for answers or recommendations 


-  The client is then in an ideal position to distance him or herself from whatever the consultant proposes 


-  ,  If we allow clients to distance themselves ,  we have already lost the war ,  because it is ,  after all ,  the clients problem we are dealing with 


-  In process consultation ,  it is essential to create  situation in which clients continue to own their own problems; the consultant becomes  partner or  helper in diagnosing and dealing with those problems 


-  But they will never be the consultants problems ,  and we should not allow clients to feel that we can take their problems off their shoulders onto our own 


-  ,  Having articulated the three models of helping and some of the assumptions that underlie them ,  let me be practical and discuss how they really work in my own experience 


-  ,  When  client ,  manager ,  friend ,  child ,  subordinate ,  or boss comes to you with  request for help or  question that invites you to give advice ,  assume that you may not know exactly what you are being asked for and should ,  therefore ,  adopt  spirit of inquiry 


-   therefore need  category of interventions ,  which  label exploratory ,  whose strategic goal is simultaneously to provide help; provide some diagnostic insight; and ensure that the client will continue to own the problem and begin to feel that we are  team working on it together 


-   may later realize that  should be the expert or the doctor ,  but  have no way of knowing that until  have thoroughly explored the situation 


-  ,  So  say things like ,  go on ,  or tell me  bit more ,  or can you describe the situation? or what do you have in mind? before  leap in with answers and advice 


-  The key is to be genuinely curious and to communicate that  feel no obligation to take the problem onto my own shoulders 


-  But  do want the client to feel that  am being helpful 


-  This ignorance is one of my most important assets ,  because it permits me to ask all sorts of dumb questions that might offend if  really understood my contact clients situation better 


-  ,  As the conversation develops ,  my focus gradually shifts to what  call diagnostic interventions ,  but  am still operating in the process consultation mode because these interventions invite diagnostic thinking from the client ,  not from me 


-  Examples might be ,  why do you feel this is an issue or  problem? or why do you think this is happening? or why did you come to me with this question? Where the focus of exploratory questions is on the what ,  the focus of diagnostic questions is on the why 


-  ,  These questions may ,  of course ,  be perceived by the client as stalling 


-  Here the focus shifts from why something might be happening to what the client has done or is intending to do about it 


-   might ask ,  what have you tried to do? or what do you plan to do? or what alternatives have you considered? ,  The characteristic common to these categories of intervention is that they all keep clients actively solving their own problems without having to deal with advice or new information that comes from the helper 


-  But we are then dealing with what  call confrontive interventions; these force the client to think about new facts ,  ideas ,  or alternatives that might not have been considered before 


-  ,  If  want to be confrontive and yet be consistent with the assumptions of process consultation ,  these interventions must be couched in  way that does not make me into an expert or  doctor ,  yet that gets across my hypotheses about what may be going on 


-  Have you considered the following items of information? Have you thought about options  or B? Maybe you are having one of the following feelingsyou are anxious or maybe angry? ,  If  state the alternatives and state them in question form ,  the client is forced to stay in the active problem-solving mode 


-  As the helper ,   am maintaining the realistic posture that  do not really know what is going on ,  but have begun to consider some hypothetical alternatives 


-  ,  The difference between offering alternatives in question form and giving advice may seem stylistically trivial ,  but it is philosophically crucial 


-  Clients operating from their stereotype of the consultant as doctor sometimes try to make consultants feel like  coward or  cop-out if they dont offer  single recommendation 


-  Therefore ,  consultants must be able to argue for their style on the logical grounds that they cannot possibly get inside the clients system and culture to  sufficient degree to recommend  single course of action 


-  ,   have been surprised by how rarely one needs to be confrontive ,  and by how much can be accomplished early in the relationship with an inquiry ,  diagnostic ,  and action alternative mode 


-  Let us now turn to how things evolve ,  which brings us to the second guideline 


-  ,  Just as it is not helpful to leap in with premature advice ,  it is also not helpful to withhold advice if the helper realizes that the client is about to make an error 


-  ,  For example ,  in the high-tech company meetings previously referred to ,  once  realized what the group was trying to do ,   found myself in an expert role with respect to two crucial issues 


-  Second ,  as the group began to redesign their meeting format ,   realized  was more expert at meeting design; therefore ,   was able to make recommendations on how meetings should be run 


-  ,  To further illustrate the contrast between the consultation models ,   would like to comment on two kinds of interventions typical of psychologically oriented management or organizational consultants: individual diagnostic profiles based on testing ,  interviewing ,  or assessment centers; and opinion or morale surveys of employees 


-  ,  Neither of these interventions is an appropriate way to identify system problems initially because they both cast the consultant in the expert or doctor role and stimulate client dependency that will later undermine joint problem solving 


-  They assume that the consultant ,  by virtue of special secret knowledge ,  must shoulder responsibility for diagnosing the situation and making prescriptive recommendations 


-  It means we should use these techniques only when the primary client has decided with the consultant that such an intervention would be helpful and when the client accepts the responsibility for the consequences of the intervention 


-   good test is whether the client is willing to explain to others what the intervention will be and why it is being used 


-  This usually means that  good deal of diagnostic problem solving has gone on before  decision is made to use such  major intervention 


-  ,  The three consulting models imply different ways of handling the intervention itself 


-  The consultant has to interpret the results and make recommendations 


-  ,  In the process consultation model ,  if individual assessment seems relevant ,  the primary client must help specify what areas need to be assessed 


-  In the expert or doctor model ,  the consultant uses  proven ,  reliable ,  and valid questionnaire ,  tells the client how to administer it for maximum participation ,  collects the data ,  analyzes it ,  and then communicates the data to the top of the organization with advice and training about feeding it back to other levels 


-  The consultant typically trains supervisors to handle the feedback sessions in ways that elicit appropriate responses from the employees 


-  Top management decides jointly with the consultant that  survey could identify problems in such  way that the organizational level owning those problems could get to work on them 


-  ,  The survey questions are based on individual and group interviews with diagonal slices of the organization; all employees are consulted on what should go into the questionnaire 


-  The intent is to get the whole organization to think diagnostically from the outset 


-  Such involvement typically results in  higher response rate and  feeling of data ownership 


-  Each lower-level group is given its own results  ( without the presence of the supervisor )  in order to do two things: correct the data or enhance it; and sort the results into those problems that the group can address and those that need to be passed upward for higher-level attention 


-  ,  This bottom-up process is dramatic in that it clearly establishes in the employees minds their ownership of the data and of some of the problems 


-  ,  As this process works its way up the organization ,  problems get identified ,  sorted out ,  and worked on by those who have the appropriate resources and responsibility 


-  There may ,  in fact ,  never be  summary aggregate report 


-  The process consultant must spell the issue out for company presidents: would they rather see fancy tables and statistics that leave them having to motivate the problem departments ,  or ,  on the other hand ,  would they rather initiate  process that identifies problems in such  way that they get worked on immediately? Most managers  have worked with prefer the second alternative once they understand its potential 


-  ,  Periodically we all find ourselves in the role of  helper 


-  If we are to play that role effectively ,  we must be conscious of the choices we make about being  process consultant ,  an information expert ,  or  doctor 


-  ,  In almost all helping situations ,  the initial interventions must be guided by an inquiry mode that establishes an appropriate helping relationship;  believe that the process consultation model is the most appropriate way to do that 


-  Finally ,  as we glean some insight into what is going on ,  we must shift into and out of the expert and doctor roles according to the clients needs and  realistic assessment of our own expertise
