- DOES THIS SOUND familiar?  large retail company  ( or bank or fast food chain )  designs its customer contact positions to be filled by people who are willing ,  at least temporarily ,  to work for wages marginally above statutory minimums 


-  It makes little effort to develop either dedication to the work or loyalty to the company 


-  The results of this strategy are quite predictable: inordinately high employee turnover and increasing customer dissatisfaction 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  traditional management responses to this scenario only exacerbate the problem 


-  High turnover reinforces the wisdom of decisions to minimize efforts in selection ,  training ,  and commitment-building activities 


-  After all ,  most managers say ,  why invest in people who arent going to stay with you? There are plenty of bodies available to fill these jobs 


-  ,  This cycle produces indifferent attitudes toward customers and poor service ,  which translate into poor perceptions of service by the customer and lower sales 


-  Customer dissatisfaction fuels further decreases in employee satisfaction ,  thus encouraging turnover 


-  High turnover further deteriorates service ,  particularly where the continuity of the customer-servicer relationship is important 


-  With the departure of each frontline employee comes the arrival of another who ,  at best ,  is just as inept 


-  Or in tight labor markets ,  the customer is often greeted by  help wanted sign and an empty server position 


-  ,  This self-perpetuating cycle of failure seems to ensure continuing deterioration of service quality ,  managerial headaches ,  and long-term decreases in sales and profits  ( see Figure  )  


-  But as we enter an era of slowed labor market growth ,  dramatic increases in the demand for service workers ,  tightened immigration policies ,  and increasing consumer demands for improved service ,  the business consequences of the cycle are increasingly untenable 


-  According to the Department of Labor ,  as of 1986 there was  pool of 16 million nomadic service employees roaming from one low-paying employer to the next ,  experiencing  stream of personal failures with employers unwilling to invest in efforts to break the cycle 


-  This group of low-tenure employees who move to new jobs with decreasing confidence and self-respect is expanding at the same time that labor markets are getting increasingly tight 


-  ,  The limited number of academic studies to date support the relationships shown in Figure  


-  For example ,  Schneider and Bowen found  direct relationship between well-designed service encounters that enhanced bank customer satisfaction and the satisfaction levels of tellers 


-  Another study suggested  direct relationship between customer satisfaction and employee motivation 


-  Others have related employee satisfaction to managements emphasis on serving customers as opposed to adhering to rules and procedures 


-  Perhaps most important of all ,  from  business standpoint ,  are studies that have linked satisfied customers directly to increased sales volumes 


-  We have thus far collected more than two dozen sets of data from service firms and consulting organizations that confirm one or more of the relationships shown in Figure  


-  ,  In spite of this evidence ,  many service organizations that are generally considered well managed continue to perpetuate the cycle 


-  Why do managers bring this problem on themselves? ,  Managers we talk with are often resigned to the possibility that the cycle of failure is inevitable and well beyond their control 


-  They present  litany of excuses: ,  At the same time ,  the number of low-paid ,  unskilled positions is growing in many retail and consumer service companies 


-  Half of all retail jobs pay less than $13 , 000 per year and  third of all health care jobs pay less than $250 per week 


-  And most growing areas of the service sector rely disproportionately on part-time workers 


-  ,  Most troubling is that many managers acknowledge the cycle of failure but continue to take actions that perpetuate it 


-  Fortunately ,  there are alternative ways of viewing and addressing the problem 


-  ,  Some service firms employing large numbers of people in daily customer contact have taken steps to break the cycle of failure and create an alternative cycle of success as shown in Figure  


-  Consider the following examples: ,  Wells Fargo and Company pays its people ,  from tellers on up ,  significantly more than competitor banks while maintaining the lowest operating expenses as  proportion of taxable revenue 


-  It currently has over forty-five distinct pay-for-performance plans 


-  Chairperson Carl Reichardt says ,  You can see that our people are being rewarded because theyre productive 


-  And that to me is the right way to go 


-  Its management invests extraordinary amounts of time and energy designing jobs and defining tasks ,  along with creating personal development and training activities for the workforce 


-  Its goal is to recruit 20 percent of its managers from its frontline workers 


-  The results are reduced turn-over ,  increased productivity ,  and customer cost reductions ranging from 10 percent to 15 percent 


-  ,  An important element in the economic and service improvements at Daytons department store ,   division of Dayton Hudson ,  is the Performance Plus program ,  which involves extensive training ,  job redesign ,  and supervisory role modeling activities 


-  In  number of test stores the program has dramatically increased the wages of frontline salespeople by 100 percent to 200 percent ,  while increasing sales and profits and improving the quality of customers shopping experiences 


-  ,  Au Bon Pain ,  an operator of quick-service French bakery cafs ,  has introduced  Partner-Manager program under which restaurant managers have earned twice the industry average and as much as $160 , 000 per year ,  five times more than managers at competing restaurants 


-  The program has resulted in double digit sales and profit increases for individual units ,  significant reductions in employee turnover ,  and service quality improvements 


-  ,  Fidelity Bank of Philadelphia has increased customer service representatives wages by 58 percent over  two-year period and authorized the representatives to resolve all customer problems involving less than $1 , 000 


-  Customer satisfaction ,  as measured by customers willingness to recommend the bank to  friend ,  has jumped from 65 percent to 90 percent! This level of loyalty translates directly into increased profits 


-  At the same time ,  the total cost of resolving small-scale customer problems has actually declined owing to the elimination of bureaucratic and time-consuming steps 


-  These firms have all achieved high levels of service quality and productivity 


-  It is important that we understand why organizations tend to perpetuate the cycle of failure ,  and how companies are differentiating their service by effectively managing entry level personnel 


-  How then have so many fallen into the cycle of failure trap? At least five factors provide partial explanations:  (  )  their assumptions about the labor pool ,  (  )  their attitudes and biases about technology ,  (  )  the availability of excuses for company inaction ,  (  )  pressures for short-term performance ,  and ,  most important ,  (  )  the lack of relevant information about the cost of perpetuating the cycle of failure 


-  ,  The United States has been blessed with  huge influx of people into the labor pool in the past two decades 


-  Many of these people ,  particularly those reentering the pool for  second career ,  have had strong educational backgrounds 


-  They have been easy to train and have accepted responsibility relatively soon after hiring 


-  ,  As  result ,  many organizations have wasted this plentiful resource 


-  This suggests the increasing importance of both designing less people-intensive services and becoming the employer of choice in targeted labor markets 


-  ,  Yet another issue will be attracting qualified entry level workers 


-  If the disparity in education levels between whites and minorities continues ,  by the year 2000  higher percent of the  


-  workforce will have attained only  high school degree or less 


-  In addition ,  the value of  high school diploma seems to be deteriorating; with an increasing degree of illiteracy among those students who do graduate ,  the outlook for job application qualifications is grim 


-  ,  Of course ,  managers are aware of these numbers today 


-  But confronted with the day-to-day demands of recruiting ,  development ,  and compensation ,  few service company executives have had time to contemplate long-term trends 


-  And in all fairness ,  regional short-term swings in labor availability have obscured general trends and distracted managers from long-term issues 


-  ,  Managers in all sectors of the economy have placed tremendous faith in the ability of technological development to solve  wide variety of problems 


-  So there is no reason to believe that technology would be any less useful in services than in manufacturing ,  particularly those services that are information intensive 


-  ,  However ,  for several reasons technology will not significantly alter the service employment demand and supply pattern 


-  First ,  much of the service sector is already as technology intensive as the manufacturing sector 


-  Investment per worker is higher in information-intensive services than in manufacturing in the United States today 


-  ,  Second ,  despite the practical mandate to reduce people intensity in many services ,  some services require  core element of personal contact that will be very difficult ,  if not impossible ,  to reduce through technology 


-  For example ,  while the use of automated teller machines will continue to increase ,  customers will still demand to interact with tellers for certain transactions 


-  In fact ,  as service technology increases ,  it does not take tremendous foresight to predict  backlash in favor of certain personal services and the use of personal interaction as  means of differentiating ones service 


-  Clearly ,  becoming the employer of choice is much less risky and allows for more organizational flexibility 


-  ,  How often have we heard lately about the inadequate and declining level of talent in the labor pool ,  the failure of the education system to adapt to changing social needs ,  the continuation of government programs that replace the desire to work ,  and even the declining importance of values that made this country great? Often the people who most frequently voice these laments are moved least to respond 


-  They act as if the problem is so great as to defy solution ,  particularly at the level of the individual business organization 


-  This leads managers to design jobs and assignments that assume the worst in people 


-  ,  The private sector cannot take responsibility for changing the basic labor pool ,  educating the population ,  or teaching the values that made the country great ,  whatever they are 


-  But we have noticed that in companies that have broken the cycle of failure and moved toward the cycle of success ,  managers continue to have faith that many people want to do good work 


-  These managers design strategies that find and retain such people before their competitors do 


-  ,  While many managers know that improving personnel recruitment ,  selection ,  training and development ,  and rewards and recognition is important ,  they acknowledge that improvement efforts simply take  back seat to budgets ,  operating plans ,  and profit and loss statements 


- 10 When interviewed ,  92 percent of CEOs ,  87 percent of COOs ,  and 83 percent of division VPs said service quality in their business was extremely important 


-  ,  At the same time ,  51 percent of CEOs ,  69 percent of COOs ,  and 70 percent of VPs said immediate financial results were extremely important 


-  This difference of 19 percentage points between division VPs and CEOs suggests that top management believes and says one thing and signals another to middle management 


-  ,  Because long-term trends occur more slowly and less dramatically than other business events ,  managers tend to push them down the agenda 


-  ,  In addition ,  one cannot underestimate the short-term pressures inflicted by the wave of financial restructurings affecting  number of large service firms 


-  ,  It is  well-known management axiom that what gets measured gets managed 


-  ,  Measurement lays the foundation for  number of activities ,  such as engineering and development 


-  It allows managers ,  other than those directly involved in operations ,  to decide whether wages paid for  certain job are too high or too low 


-  ,  Measurement also helps us make cost-cutting decisions with certainty in bad times 


-  We must also try to measure the value to customers of our expenditures 


-  If you emphasize costs over customer value you will lose customers 


-  Unfortunately ,  customer value is hard to measure 


-  They must also place  value on the reduced productivity that will affect customers for  period of time after  position is refilled 


-  ,  Our research did begin to uncover some comprehensive approaches to measuring the impact of turnover on customers 


-  Two divisions of Marriott Corporation recently carried out  study that included as an assumption ,  based on management estimates ,  that  10 percent reduction in the industrys historically high turnover rate would reduce customer nonrepeats by  percent to  percent ,  providing revenue increases of $50 million to $150 million 


-  The study concluded that even at the upper range of estimates for recruiting ,  training ,  and lost customer costs ,  an overall reduction of 10 percent in labor turnover would yield savings significantly greater than the total current profits of the two divisions 


-  Good ideas for new services are aborted early because the operating organization is not able to deliver that 


-  Unfortunately ,  this assumption is often based on reasonably good historical information ,  such as the failure to deliver new services in the past 


-  The result? Failure to capitalize on competitive opportunity 


-  Countless factors influence the policies for managing relationships among managers ,  frontline service personnel ,  and customers 


-  However ,  in our examples of leading service firms patterns have emerged 


-  They include both the underlying assumptions that managers bring to the task and the way that they go about setting in motion the cycle of success 


-  ,  Many managers who have broken the cycle of failure begin by assuming that there is  limited pool from which to draw entry level service providers ,  especially those that fit particular strategies 


-  This does not mean that these firms look only for individuals with ready-made talent and attitudes 


-  But it does mean they take extra care to select and develop people to ensure that the pool is not depleted 


-  ,  These organizations carefully assess the traits they need in entry level people and determine which can be imparted through training and which cannot 


-  They select people based on those traits that must be hired rather than trained into the organization 


-  The emphasis is on how people think ,  not who they are 


-  As  result ,  the growing demographic heterogeneity of the labor pool is largely irrelevant 


-  Firms select  workforce from  heterogeneous population that is homogeneous on psychographic dimensions 


-  ,  These organizations consider technology an essential supporting resource for face-to-face service delivery 


-  For some transactions ,  technology may play  primary role ,  as in the use of automatic teller machines 


-  ,  Further ,  these organizations often believe that technology provides limited competitive advantage because it is usually available to all competitors that can afford it 


-  Positive ,  customer-oriented attitudes ,  however ,  are considered much more difficult to introduce than new technologies and thus provide competitive advantage 


-  ,  Managers in the firms we observed make no excuses for the turnover rates among their entry level employees or the quality of service they deliver 


-  They recognize that real competitive advantage comes to those who confront such issues successfully 


-  ,  Pressures for short-term performance are every bit as great among these managers as others ,  and are often self-imposed 


-  But these managers assume that appropriate responses are to hire or train winners ,  individuals whose own standards are at least as high as the organizations 


-  This requires  one-time major investment to raise the organizations standards ,  communicate new expectations ,  and implement new ways to achieve expectations 


-  The organization will not tolerate others 


-  And winning performances provide the resources for hiring and developing people that will contribute to winning performances 


-  ,  Finally ,  managers in many of these firms religiously measure the costs associated with the employee and customer life cycles 


-  They know that new customers are more costly and less profitable to serve than existing ones 


-  They know what it costs to hire ,  develop ,  and replace preferred employees 


-  They know what it costs to lose customers and key employees 


-  And they have  pretty good idea of the relationship between customer and employee loss 


-  They know these things not only because they have taken the time to measure them ,  but because they track them continuously 


-  ,  These assumptions lead to distinctly different strategies and programs for dealing with the cycle of failure 


-  ,  One thing that differentiates our employers of choice is that each of them has made  conscious and exhaustive effort to link their human resource ,  service ,  and business strategies 


-  Consider the following three examples 


-  Fairfield offers its customers ,  what management terms road warriors ,  just two things: the cleanest rooms and the friendliest staff available ,  at  budget price  ( often less than $40 per night )  


-  Given the simplicity of the service package ,  the inns are staffed with only two categories of frontline employeesfront desk and housekeeping personnel 


-  ,  Management decided which qualities it would seek in employees ,  commissioned  questionnaire and interview intended to identify those qualities ,  and then selected people carefully 


-  It was looking not only for dependable people with good work habits ,  but also for people to whom  pay-for-performance evaluation system ,  called Scorecard ,  would appeal 


-  ,  With Scorecard ,  guests answer four questions on  computer-administered touch screen at check out 


-  By correlating their reactions to questions such as How would you evaluate the cleanliness of your room? and How personable was the hotel inn personnel at the time of check in? with data indicating which employees were responsible for  particular guest ,  management can keep  running tab on individual performance 


-  The questionnaire process is easy enough to bring in  50 percent response rate ,  which provides the necessary volume of observations 


-  ,  In addition to providing base pay comparable to local wages ,  Fairfield awards monthly bonuses of up to 10 percent of base pay to service employees ,  depending on their individual and unit Scorecard results 


-  Performance results are posted on  regular basis for the unit ,  the region ,  and the chain 


-  ,  To combat one of the most difficult problems in the lodging industry ,  absenteeism ,  Fairfield replaces all but one week of vacation with earned leave ,  days off with pay that are earned with perfect attendance for one- and three-month periods 


-  Dependable attendance makes work schedules more predictable for everyone and helps build  winning team attitude 


-  ,  Feedback from customers and employees has been overwhelmingly positive ,  and the chain has staked out  successful position in an incredibly crowded market segment ,  although some employees have discovered that the Scorecard system is not for them and have left quickly 


-  Others have been encouraged to leave by their peers ,  who were being penalized by poor unit performance 


-  ,  Few organizations have the opportunity to avoid the cycle of failure from the first day of operation 


-  Like Daytons of Dayton Hudson and Au Bon Pain ,  most organizations have to take actions to reverse the turn of the wheel 


-  ,  This full-line department store chain has concluded that restoring the high service levels that were prominent among major retailers in their early days is absolutely critical to retaining their current customers and regaining those customers who left for the more personalized treatment available in specialty shops 


-  Three major assumptions drive Daytons Performance Plus strategy: ,  The program focuses on selection ,  training ,  and incentives all aimed at providing superior customer service performed by sales consultants who go the extra mile for the customer 


-  On the sales floor ,  consultants are encouraged to take customers into different departments when needed and to develop  repeat clientele by sending thank you notes and informing customers of sales on new merchandise 


-  ,  The company believes that selection plays an important role in the system 


-  Interviewers look for candidates hoping to make retail sales  career 


-  Because the compensation is ,  on average ,  20 percent higher than at prior wage levels ,  the company can attract college graduates and others who would normally apply for jobs in sales and manufacturing companies 


-  After hiring ,  new employees go through  two-day celebration training in which the underlying theme is Its my company 


-  ,  The Performance Plus program has expanded to eleven stores in the thirty-four unit chain over the past three years 


-  Sales have improved dramatically  ( as much as 25 percent in individual sales per hour )  ,  wages have escalated to the extent that increasingly capable salespeople can be recruited ,  and total operating costs have shifted but remained stable 


-  At the same time ,  customer response to the changes ,  as measured by the chains service quality survey ,  has been dramatic 


-  And the program has not been without its negative consequences 


-   successful union organizing drive among long-term employees in Detroit was traced to job insecurities and fears of performance pressures 


-  However ,  management believes the program will eventually address these problems appropriately 


-  ,  The chain continues to fine-tune the program as it adds three to four stores to the program each year 


-  Many issues remain ,  but management believes that results to date absolutely justify the investment 


-  ,  Breaking the cycle of failure for entry level jobs often means breaking it as well for the supervisors 


-  ( In fact ,  one of us helped coin the term while serving as  senior executive in the company 


-  )  Store managers were paid salaries comparable to or marginally above those at local fast food restaurants and given very little latitude 


-  Results were predictable: the usual revolving door of store managers and employees in  business that thrives on relationships built with frequent customers who have acquired the Au Bon Pain habit 


-  ,  To reverse the cycle ,  management negotiated contracts with willing store managers that established targets for each store 


-  Company and store management would split equally profits over and above targets 


-  At the same time ,  managers were given great latitude to change procedures ,  staffing policies ,  and even store layout ,  provided they met certain standards for store decor ,  core service ,  and food and service quality 


-  These standards are evaluated frequently by mystery shoppers hired by the company 


-  ,  Instead of acting as supervisors or controllers ,  corporate managers shifted their roles to become coaches ,  consultants ,  cheerleaders ,  and increasingly enthusiastic observers as store volumes under the program quickly doubled in  number of cases 


-  In an effort to boost his performance beyond even this mark ,  one store manager decided to initiate his own program 


-  Gary Aronson ,  the manager of the Au Bon Pain at Bostons Prudential Center ,  is now in the midst of his fourth year under the Partner-Manager Program 


-  He has ,  over this period ,  earned as much as $160 , 000  year ,  while paying his frontline employees ,  some of them in their first jobs ,  up to $23 , 000  year when the industry norm is $10 , 000 to $12 , 000 


-  How can Aronson afford to do this? He only hires people willing to work fifty to sixty hours per week ,  with overtime pay over forty hours 


-  He has cut his head count by nearly 70 percent as  result of the longer hours and higher productivity 


-  Employee absenteeism is nearly unheard of;  missed day means lost overtime pay 


-  And Aronson has cut turnover to roughly 10 percent per year in entry level jobs ,  in which 200 percent is quite normal 


-  Better yet ,  sales have soared as customers patronize the people they see every day behind the counters 


-  ,  In short ,  Aronson has built  lean ,  mean team composed of entry level people who think and act like winners 


-  And Au Bon Pain spends very little to attract new employees 


-  By word-of-mouth ,  it can choose from the best talent not only for management but for entry level jobs in most of its markets 


-  Corporate management has been freed to plot strategies for growth and profitability ,  Increasingly ,  we can begin to identify common elements in these programs  ( see Table  )  


-  ,  In turn ,  such acts beyond basic service are recognized and applauded by management whenever brought to their attention 


-  Wells Fargo even instituted  peer recognition program to applaud the often unrecognized acts that make for an outstanding coworker 


-  ,  At  basic level ,  organizations need to recognize that employees often feel disaffected when poor performers are carried on the payroll 


-  Recent national surveys of employees indicate that as many as 75 percent of those surveyed believe that management carries dead wood employees for too long 


- 12 The warm bodies approach that drives many service employers promotes not only bad service but deteriorating attitudes among solid performers 


-  ,  Each of the firms we have discussed has successfully escalated employee wages ,  often dramatically ,  without lowering economic performance 


-  How have they accomplished this seemingly impossible feat? Simply stated ,  they have aggressively focused on the total cost of doing business ,  including the aggregate wage bill and individual productivity levels ,  without taking their eye off customer service levels 


-  Each of these high-paying firms has successfully demonstrated the potential for individuals to achieve peak performance when expectations and rewards are high 


-  ,  Pay for performance is an integral element of some ,  but not all ,  of these programs 


-  Those that employ it take care to base it on measures of both the quantity and quality of results 


-  This requires  conscious effort to measure ,  communicate ,  and reward results associated with quality 


-  ,  Au Bon Pains store managers have  great deal of latitude in how they run their businesses 


-  But their employment contracts can be terminated if the quality of their offerings falls below minimum standards in areas such as speed of service ,  availability of product ,  and cleanliness 


-  ,  Similarly ,  at Daytons each salesperson must maintain minimum service quality levels to qualify for productivity incentives 


-  This is particularly critical in services in which quality could be neglected in pursuit of sales volume or other forms of productivity 


-  ,  The realities of the labor market over the next decade are clear 


-  More people with less relevant job preparation will earn higher wages as frontline service providers 


-  Service levels and economic performance will deteriorate in firms that fail to engage in  fundamental rethinking of the employee-organization-customer relationship 


-  ,  What are the consequences of  widespread effort to break the cycle of failure? Will it produce  skimming of the most able from the labor pool with  growing competition for  small subgroup of people? Managers ask us these questions frequently 


-  They assume that all organizations will be selecting for the same sets of traits ,   phenomenon that we have not yet observed in our examination of corporate human resource strategies 


-  Nevertheless ,  this possibility suggests there might be  modest early mover advantage for firms in certain industries or geographic areas who recruit and retain employees fitting their service strategies particularly well 


-  ,  In nearly every service industry and labor market with which we are familiar ,  at least one organization has broken the cycle of failure 


-  Its managers have made the commitment and the up-front expenditure of money and effort to achieve  vital but largely invisible competitive advantage 


-  The real value of these efforts will become more visible in the restricted labor market that all service firms will face in the coming decade 


-  Day after day ,  these firms will spend less than their competitors for recruiting and training 


-  They will attract the most performance-minded managers and frontline personnel ,  people whose personal philosophies toward work fit those of their employers 


-  They will provide  more satisfying work environment for effective performers 


-  But most critically ,  they will retain those people who provide the most satisfactory continuing relationships with valued customers 


-  ,  The next decade will belong to those firms that break the cycle of failure 


-  Even more important ,  it will belong to their customers and employees
