-  international industrial competitiveness ,  driven by our continuing enormous balance of payments deficit ,  has tended to focus media and political attention during the 1980s on manufacturing 


-   torrent of books and articles has inundated business managers ,  offering guidance on how to improve manufacturing performance 


-  Terms like world class manufacturing and dynamic manufacturing sprinkle discussions in college classrooms ,  corporate boardrooms ,  and the halls of Congress 


-  The concept of manufacturing strategy ,  considered somewhat esoteric only  few years ago ,  gets increasing attention from both top managers and academics 


-  ,  There is ,  however ,  another battlefield of economic competitiveness where operations effectiveness is just as crucial to success as it is on the factory floor 


-  ,  We have no quarrel with the assertion that the United States needs  strong manufacturing base in order to maintain and improve its standard of living 


-  Just as our machine tool and semiconductor industries should have studied the successful attacks of foreign steel ,  auto ,  and consumer electronics producers on our domestic market-and prepared themselves for similar onslaughtsso should our service industries study and learn from our manufacturing sectors decline 


-  Those manufacturing firms that have remade themselves or sustained their leadership position have shared  common approach: they have focused attention on their most important markets and then mobilized their operations organization ,  through  well-planned strategy ,  to squarely meet those markets needs 


-  We will examine ideas that have emerged from successful manufacturers and outstanding service firms 


-  Our key conclusions are that service firms ,  like manufacturing firms ,  can structure their operations according to  four-stage model of competitiveness and that they can apply the manufacturing strategy concepts of ocus and integration as they move from lower to higher stages 


-  To remain competitive ,   service firm must consistently meet or exceed customers expectations of valuethe price they pay relative to the quality and convenience of the service they receive 


-  ,  An airlines core service ,  for example ,  is getting someone from one place to another 


-  Its peripheral services include its reservation and baggage handling systems ,  while amenities consist of such things as cabin food service and in-flight entertainment 


-  Put another way ,  the core and primary peripheral services define the lower limit of customer expectations about performance 


-  These latter activities are analogous to the production processes in the factory working on things rather than people 


-  The existence of these two spheres of activity and ,  more important ,  the emphasis on the encounter as the core output function in most service organizations are what differentiate services from manufacturing 


-  ,  Regardless of  firms particular competitive strategy ,  senior management needs some framework for relating operations activities to the firms overall service performance 


-  This is so for several reasons 


-  The final and most compelling reason ,  in our opinion ,  is to provide  current perspective and future vision that can be communicated to the organizations members 


-  The questions where are we now? and where do we want to be? are more easily answered if they can be related to even  rough performance classification 


-  ( An analogous framework ,  developed by Wheelwright and Hayes ,  is widely used to analyze the role of operations in strategy development for manufacturing firms 


-  )  ,  Before discussing the stages ,  we must consider two issues 


-  Every service delivery system embodies  unique set of choices about such factors asservice quality ,  role of the back office ,  workforce policies ,  and the like 


-  What determines the firms stage is the overall balance among these different positions where ,  in  sense ,  the firms center of gravity lies 


-  In defining this center of gravity ,  the model assumes  weighing of each dimensions relative importance 


-  Thus  firm can achieve Stage  or possibly Stage  status ,  even if it is not outstanding on all dimensions ,  providing that it is clearly superior on the critical success factors for its industry 


-  Scandinavian Airlines Systems  ( SAS )  moved from Stage  to Stage  in about  year and  half After Suffering  huge operating loss in fiscal year 19791980 ,  its CEO ,  Jan Carlzon ,  instituted  program involving some 120 service improvements designed to help it become the airline of choice for its selected target market ,  the full-fare business passenger 


-  The improvements focused on achieving exceptional on-time performance and excellent service by all personnel 


-  An example of  gradual decline is that of Sears ,  whose complacency and bureaucratization have made them play catch-up in everything from pricing to customer service 


-  ,  Often ,  people assume that new technology will put them on the fast track through the four stages 


-  However ,  we know of no firms that have leapfrogged  stage solely by relying on  new technology 


-  ,  With these points in mind ,  we now consider the stages themselves 


-  ,  Service firms that fall into this category tend to consider their operations organizations necessary evils 


-  It assumes that if operations can do what it is supposed to do ,  without major disruptions ,  the firm will be able to make  profit 


-  Few people advance out of operations into another function or into general management ,  so operations tends to be regarded as  dead end 


-  Ironically ,  as in the case of the banking industry ,  efforts to cut labor costs frequently result in higher total costs because of the need to fix quality problems 


-  ,  The problem with niches is that one usually outgrows them ,  or they grow to the point where other companies decide to move in 


-  Instead of reacting to internal directives ,  operations reacts to external practices ,  particularly in its back office  ( which usually is trying to minimize cost no matter what service priorities the front office identifies )  


-  Management still regards operations employees as specialists ,  and therefore they have limited upward mobility 


-  In fact ,  their allegiance to their industry profession ,  often quite narrowly defined ,  usually surpasses their allegiance to the particular company they happen to work for at any given time 


-  ,  The operations organization in  Stage  firm also reflects  coherent operations strategy ,  that is ,  making consistent choices for each element in Table  relative to price ,  quality ,  flexibility ,  and convenience objectives 


-  Relative to service quality ,  for example ,  operations is the typical advocate of  Total Quality Management philosophy ,  and it assumes the lead role in implementing service guarantees and service enhancing technologies ,  and fostering worker empowerment 


-  They understand the essential strengths and limitations of their operations and are well aware of the careful analysis that must precede change 


-  It encourages all of its employees to learn multiple jobs in order to prepare themselves for advancement and to appreciate the problems and jobs of the other guy 


-  Rather than simply investigating customer needs and attempting to fulfill them ,  Stage  companies  (  


-  ,  Disney ,  Four Seasons Hotels ,  and Singapore Airlines )  seek to create needs ,  establish expectations ,  and continually expand those expectations 


-  ,  Customers ,  in fact ,  become consultants ,  sources of ideas as well as revenue ,  as in the case of CIGNAs Customer Advisory Board 


-  It designs controls and rewards to motivate continuous improvements upon those standards ,  and it gives employees the tools and training to achieve them 


-  Rather than being simply  means for cutting costs and removing people ,  it becomes  potential means for developing competitive advantage ,  making it possible for the organization to do things its competitors cant do 


-  For example ,  some leading firms have adopted an informate and automate strategy to let the customer know vital information and to facilitate the servers job 


-  ,  Workers in Stage  companies become company men and women in the best sense 


-  Like production employees of world class manufacturers  ( the Millikens ,  Xeroxes ,  and Motorolas )  ,  operations employees of world class service firms ,  no matter what their job ,  know they are working someplace special and doing something valued by the company 


-  ,  Of course ,  managers of such companies also have tremendous pride in the organizations service and appreciate the centrality of operations in providing it 


-  Often such firms regard an outstanding service delivery system as so important that operations experience is considered essential to ones upward mobility 


-  The president of Swissair has been seen dispensing boarding passes and has instructed all managers of the airline ,  regardless of function ,  to spend one day  month dealing directly with customers 


-  One challenge is sustaining superior performance at every point in its service delivery system and throughout its service network ,  as service firms often are judged more by the performance of their weakest links than by the things they do especially well 


-  Operations ability to reproduce and manage its proven system in highly diverse cultural settings McDonalds in Moscowultimately determines the firms permanence ,  literally ,  as  world class competitor 


-  ,  The concept of manufacturing strategy has been around for over twenty years ,  but only in the last decade has it received serious consideration from academics and practitioners 


- 10 Therefore ,   company must begin designing  manufacturing system with  careful ,  and broadly shared ,  assessment of how the firm will compete in  particular industryin what respects will its products and services be distinctive? Once the company establishes its competitive priorities ,  the paradigm provides an orderly approach for examining the organizations structure  ( facilities and equipment )  and infrastructure  ( policies and systems )  to determine if they are consistent with those priorities 


-  The term manufacturing strategy encompasses the whole process: setting competitive priorities ,  making structural and infrastructural decisions ,  and establishing  discipline  ( such as the notion of focused factories and plant charters )  for ensuring that the structure and infrastructure remain consistent with the priorities 


-  ,  We can easily adapt the same framework to service companies ,  although we must make  few modifications to accommodate the differences between services and manufactured products 


-  ,  Assuming that the service company is  going concern and knows how it will compete in its industry ,  management may move around the wheel in Figure 1 baselining operations performance ,  setting priorities ,  focusing operations ,  achieving coherence ,  and incorporating learningwith each step linked to customer requirements 


-  ,   useful tool for this purpose is performance-importance mapping 


-  ,  In this example ,  we have plotted factors of importance to bank customers 


-  The map shows that customers value short lines and think this banks lines are too long 


-  Customers believe statement accuracy is very important ,  and they think the bank performs very well in this area 


-  ,  In manufacturing ,  focus calls for organizing factories according to the products specific processing requirements 


-  Another is that the typical direct service worker is often ill prepared in skills and policy knowledge to effectively customize  service 


-  ,  Service companies that lose focus ,  like their brethren in manufacturing ,  fail due to one or more of the following reasons: ,  By way of example ,  if an HMO chain seeks to improve the atmosphere of its waiting rooms ,  it can selectively change magazines ,  provide fresh coffee ,  or manage other forms of visible evidence of service quality 


-  Similar things could be done in the process side ,  such as changing greeting scripts at reception 


-  Banc One has  formalized process for providing the results of operations experiments to its member banks ,   practice that CEO John McCoy credits for rapid implementation of its operating improvements 


-  ,  Another approach is to use home office pilot plants to evaluate the layout and appearance of  field unit 


-  ,  Unlike manufacturing ,  which has often pushed operations to the background ,  the service sector challenges operations executives to use their inherently central position more effectively 


-  We believe these executives should take the lead in changing their areas relationship to customers ,  employees ,  and processes 


- 12 This ,  after all ,  seemed to work well for manufacturers because it kept outside influences ,  that is ,  customers ,  from disturbing the production process 


-  In retrospect ,  this closed system philosophy overlooked the fact that there are positive benefits to both the customer and the organization by having the customer closely linked to the server ,  even though the job is traditionally performed in the customers absence 


-  From an information exchange perspective ,  the greater the links between consumer and producer ,  the easier it is to understand and respond to the customers needs 


-  In manufacturing ,  the ability to link the producer with the consumer through direct computer linkups driving CAD/CAM systems has provided the technological wherewithal to go forward to the past to  craftsman-type organization 


-  That is ,  it has reintegrated design ,  production ,  and even sales into the manufacturing firms back officeits factory 


-  In fact ,  we would go even further and advocate  new positioncustomer task analystto look for ways to simplify the customers role in the service encounter 


-  ,  Manufacturing and service firms face  common problemcoordination of activities around  common purpose 


-  Although both have made extensive use of information technologyCAD/CAM and materials management in manufacturing and database management and transaction processing in servicesboth are still wrestling with the age old problem of getting departments to work together 


-  For many firms ,  however ,  this approach is only marginally successful ,  for the simple reason that many important supplier duties are not explicitly measured ,  monitored ,  and most of all ,  rewarded in performance reviews 


-  Lets face it ,  no matter how company oriented the manager ,  helping the other guy will always be  secondary priority ,  unless it is an important and rewarded priority on the management by objectives sheet 


-  What we do advocate is that internal supplier service duties and actions be clearly acknowledged in the organizations performance measurement and reward system 


-  ,  Almost by definition ,  Stage  companies can compete with reasonable success within their domestic industry 


-  So it is that the only competitor that  Stage  company has to fear is  world class Stage  companyone that has developed its capabilities and honed its operations to the point that it can compete anywhere in the world
