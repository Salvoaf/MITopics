-  ,  the big financial services company ,  grew up around its information technology capabilities 


-  IT was the key factor that allowed the young discount-brokerage house to offer customers lower prices on trades than traditional brokers 


-  Later ,  as discount brokerage became more of  commodity business ,  Schwab transformed itself into  full-service ,  online broker ,  and by 1998 it was earning  significant share of its profits in the online trading business 


-  But in the next few years competitors caught up to Schwab ,  and some surpassed it 


-  Several brokerage houses ,  both discount and full service ,  were frequently able to beat Schwab on price 


-  ,  Surprising as it seems ,  given the companys strategy of using technology to distance itself from competitors ,  IT had become part of Schwabs problem 


-  By the companys own reckoning ,  IT staffers responses to business requests had become slow and expensive 


-  IT engineers had to spend more time than ever fixing bugs in the systems 


-  Meanwhile ,  several big ,  ambitious projects were overdue  including the tax-lot accounting system Schwab had envisioned to serve its most profitable customers  and the slow progress of these projects was preventing the company from responding effectively to competition 


-  Still ,  the company kept throwing money at projects because it didnt see an alternative 


-  We said ,  we have to keep spending money because were half pregnant and you cant be half pregnant ,  recalls Deborah McWhinney ,  president of Schwab Institutional 


-   red flag went up when Schwab found itself spending 18% of revenue on IT while three of its leading competitors were spending 13% or less ,   cost disadvantage amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars annually 


-  ,  The fact that  company as tech savvy as Schwab could find itself in this predicament is instructive 


-  It underscores  growing realization we have found among the companies we work with that the usual diagnoses of ITs troubles  and the usual prescriptions for fixing those troubles  are often misguided 


-  For many years now ,  companies seeking to deliver higher business performance by harnessing IT have focused on alignment 


-  By alignment ,  we mean the degree to which the IT group understands the priorities of the business and expends its resources ,  pursues projects and provides information consistent with them 


-  Almost every company we have worked with recognizes that IT and business priorities must be tightly linked 


-  In practical terms ,  that means IT spending must be matched to the companys growth strategies 


-  There must be shared ownership and shared governance of IT projects 


-  Its become something of  mantra voiced by senior business executives:  lack of alignment can doom IT either to irrelevance or to failure 


-  But in our work with IT and business executives and dozens of companies in many different industries ,  we began to see  troubling pattern: Even at companies that were focused on alignment ,  business performance dependent on IT sometimes went sideways ,  or even declined 


-  ,  Why wouldnt  high degree of alignment alone bring about improvement? In our experience ,   narrow focus on alignment reflects  fundamental misconception about the nature of IT 


-  Under performing capabilities are often rooted not just in misalignment but in the complexity of systems ,  applications and other infrastructure 


-  This complexity develops for understandable reasons 


-  At Schwab ,  for instance ,  the enormous complexity of the companys IT system wasnt the result of IT engineers somehow running amok 


-  Rather ,  the companys various divisions were driving independent initiatives ,  each one designed to address its own competitive needs 


-  ITs effort to satisfy its various  ( and sometimes conflicting )  business constituencies created  set of Byzantine ,  overlapping systems that might satisfy individual units for  while but did not advance the companys business as  whole 


-  ,  Complexity doesnt magically disappear just because an IT organization learns to focus on aligned projects rather than less aligned ones 


-  On the contrary ,  in some situations it can actually get worse 


-  Weve seen firsthand how IT organizations provide dedicated resources  such as application developers and data centers ,  to each business unit  in order to improve alignment 


-  They develop customized best-of-breed solutions designed to serve each businesss unique needs 


-  Meanwhile ,  they ignore the need for standardization and upgrading of legacy systems 


-  They create  labyrinth of new complexity on top of the old ,  making system enhancements and infrastructure improvements ever more difficult to implement and leaving significant potential scale benefits untapped 


-  Costs rise ,  delays mount and the fragmentation makes it difficult for managers to coordinate across business units 


-  Connell ,  senior executive vice president and CIO of Selective Insurance Group ,  of Branchville ,  New Jersey ,  told us ,  Aligning  poorly performing IT organization to the right business objectives still wont get the objectives accomplished 


-  ,  To test these patterns systematically ,  and find out more about the root causes of companies IT problems ,  we conducted  survey of more than 500 senior business and technology executives worldwide 


-  We followed up the survey with in-depth interviews of 30 chief information officers and other senior leaders from  broad cross-section of companies 


-  ,  One thing we confirmed quickly was that Schwab is far from alone in its belief that it is struggling to harness IT to its growth strategy 


-  Only 18% of respondents believed that their companys IT spending was highly aligned with business priorities  that IT ,  in other words ,  always or nearly always established and acted on priorities that supported their business strategy 


-  Only 15% believed that their IT capability was highly effective ,  that IT ran reliably ,  without excess complexity and always or nearly always delivered projects with promised functionality ,  timing and cost 


-  ,  The survey also showed that almost three-quarters of respondents believed that their IT capability was neither highly aligned nor highly effective ,  again consistent with the general patterns we have seen 


-  )  These companies occupy what we call the maintenance zone 


-  IT at these companies is generally underperforming ,  undervalued and kept largely separate from  companys core business functions 


-  Corporate management budgets the amounts necessary to keep the systems running ,  but IT doesnt offer enough added value to the business and often isnt expected to 


-  Companies in the maintenance zone recorded  slower rate of growth  2% below the three-year average in the survey  while spending the same as the average every year on IT 


-  ,  Only about one in five senior executives reported in the survey that their company was highly aligned ,  fairly consistent with our experience 


-  When we looked at the 11% of companies in which IT was highly aligned but was not highly effective ,  however ,  we found those companies were considerably worse off than their counterparts in the maintenance zone 


-  While their IT spending was 13% higher than average ,  their three-year growth rates were 14% lower than average 


-  ,  This finding was startling ,  even given the limitations of the survey ,  which combined self-reported assessments of senior executives with actual data on IT investment and business performance at their companies 


-  It underscored the pattern we encountered at  number of companies with ample IT budgets and strong alignment ,  but not much to show for it 


-  )  In these cases ,  it seemed to us possible ,  even likely ,  that the alignment prescription could be worse than the disease 


-  Our thinking has been shaped in part by Schwab and  handful of other companies that have been learning to break out of the trap and create IT organizations that enable growth rather than inhibit it 


-  The number of companies that have already succeeded at this task is small: In our survey ,  only 7% of respondents said that their IT organizations were both highly aligned with business strategy and highly effective in delivering what was asked of them 


-  But those companies as  group recorded  compound annual growth rate over three years that was 35% higher than the survey average 


-  More surprising still ,  they were spending 6% less on IT than other respondents 


-  For  large company ,  the stakes in getting IT right can thus be enormous 


-  In some cases ,  companies can save hundreds of millions in costs ,  while increasing sales growth dramatically 


-  ,  How have these companies managed to reach that point? While each has followed its own path ,  there are some common approaches shared by the high performers 


-  Several have diagnosed early on where their company falls on the spectrum of effectiveness and alignment 


-  )  For the majority of companies ,  the single most important task has been to forget about enhancing alignment for the moment and to focus first on increasing the effectiveness of the IT organization 


-  In order for IT to enable growth ,  that first move is critical  and its the one that companies often get wrong 


-  Maintenance-zone companies that try to move directly upward on our chart into the alignment zone ,  rather than rightward into the effectiveness zone ,  typically end up in Schwabs contradictory position 


-  Because they believe that alignment is the key solution to their IT troubles ,  they can wind up spending enormous amounts of money without solving their problems 


-  ,  The legendary inability of IT organizations to do things quickly continually mystifies people outside of IT and frustrates those within it 


-  The IT manager he is talking to knows that the change isnt so little  because of overlapping systems ,  adjustments need to be made in hundreds of different places  but she cant expect him to understand all the machinations involved 


-  Both feel that the IT system is like  swamp: Projects just get bogged down 


-  Some companies spend more than 80% of their IT budget on maintenance ,  patches ,  upgrades and other routine expenses ,  and less than 20% on the development of new applications and capabilities 


-  ,  All told ,  85% of our survey respondents reported that their companys IT capabilities were not highly effective 


-  Note that high effectiveness alone made  substantial difference to  companys economics 


-  Even companies that dont consider their IT organizations highly aligned were spending 15% less than average ,  and their growth rates were 11% higher 


-  For many companies ,  these are numbers that justify considerable investment in pursuing effectiveness 


-  ,  Making your companys IT organization effective does not necessarily involve replacing people in IT 


-  You could hire  whole new staff only to find they run into the same problems as the old staff  ( probably more ,  since they wont be familiar with the crazy quilt of IT systems built up over the years )  


-  Any companys first step should be to focus relentlessly on reducing complexity rather than increasing it 


-  That sounds like an unexceptionable nostrum ,  except that the cheapest and quickest way to respond to individual demands for improvements from business units is almost always to do something that increases complexity 


-  Reducing complexity means developing and implementing companywide standards 


-  It means replacing legacy systems where possible and eliminating add-ons 


-  Such an approach requires  greater investment of time and money upfront and will lead to lower costs only later 


-  For that reason alone ,  it can be hard for companies to make the commitment 


-  ,  One company that was able to make such  commitment is De Beers  


-  When Debbie Farnaby became its director of information technologies four years ago ,  she found  huge number of different application programs in use at De Beers facilities around the world 


-  The problem wasnt lack of alignment 


-  IT staffers worked closely with production managers at each mine and would develop applications  often in the computer language they happened to be most familiar with  to do whatever the mine managers needed 


-  In addition ,  the IT organization was bleeding money: It spent roughly 20% of its total software investment every year on licensing fees alone 


-  ,  Farnaby began the process of replacing most of the local applications with  single SAP enterprise resource planning system 


-  At the time of our interview ,  she had rolled out the new system to nearly all of De Beerss locations worldwide 


-  It had taken three and  half years and cost 320 million rand  ( about $45 million at current exchange rates )  


-  The new system has allowed her to reduce IT costs and head count every year 


-  It has standardized  wide variety of applications across the entire company 


-  It generates information faster than ever before 


-  In De Beerss case ,  the cost of the new system wasnt nearly as great as it seemed: The savings on software licensing costs alone were nearly sufficient ,  over time ,  to cover the entire amount 


-  ,  An effective IT organization needs  wide variety of capabilities ,  ranging from staffing the help desk to creating and integrating innovative business applications 


-  Traditionally ,  most organizations did as much as they could in-house 


-  Today nearly all the capabilities any company might want are available from  range of suppliers ,  including low-cost IT specialists in India and elsewhere 


-  Choosing the right source for  capability  maximizing effectiveness while minimizing costs  is thus  critical consideration 


-  ,  First: Is there value our companys IT organization can add that will merit keeping the work in-house? Outsourcing ,  whether it means sending the work to offshore vendors or relying on prepackaged solutions ,  is nearly always cheaper than developing solutions in-house 


-  Still ,  in-house development often makes sense for applications that are strategic in nature or critical to competitive differentiation 


-  McCartin ,  determined that in-house development in selected areas would actually allow the bank to differentiate itself from its competitors 


-  Four years later ,  McCartins department has developed customized applications for statements ,  wire transfers ,  treasury management ,  pricing ,  billing and  loyalty program ,  among others 


-  The in-house programs ,  said Paul Geraghty ,  wholesale banking executive vice president ,  are much smoother to use ,  much more navigable and integrate better with other products that we have under development 


-  The look and feel is much more consistent across National City products ,  and  think clients will therefore be inclined to buy more 


-  ,  Another question: If outsourcing seems to be indicated ,  can we learn to outsource effectively? Many of the CIOs we spoke with emphasized that they needed  deep understanding of the tasks or projects being outsourced ,  so that vendors could be held accountable for performance and price 


-  When De Beers installed its SAP system ,  for instance ,  it ran its own customer competence centers  ( as SAP calls centers for coordination and technical support )  for the first 18 months 


-  Recently ,  CIO Farnaby has decided that the company understands the centers issues ,  so she is exploring the possibility of outsourcing center management 


-  Similarly ,  De Beers decided to outsource its help desk  but not before Farnabys team had educated users throughout the company about how to use  help desk effectively 


-  Today the cost of the help desk service is 66% below what it was when it was run in-house 


-  ,  Still another question: Can we unbundle particular IT projects ,  separate out the routine or less strategic parts from those requiring more interaction with management or customers and outsource only the former? Selective Insurance ,  for example ,  outsources to an Indian vendor some legacy systems that will not be rebuilt 


-  Meanwhile ,  Selective develops new applications in-house 


-  But the company also breaks down work into segments and makes individual decisions about each segment 


-  ,  Whatever the sourcing decisions ,  companies need to revisit them regularly as their strategic priorities and in-house capabilities change 


-  ,  Companies cannot build effectiveness unless they hold IT and the business accountable for delivering expected results on time and on budget 


-  It sounds obvious ,  but many companies observe it only in the breach 


-  Survey data suggest that about three-quarters of IT projects are canceled or fail to deliver expected results on time and on budget 


-  It isnt sufficient for company executives simply to issue an order that people will now be held accountable 


-  True accountability reflects organizational changes: Executives get the information they need to measure IT progress; IT people are held accountable for outcomes; line managers give IT the resources it needs and then work closely with IT leaders to exercise joint supervision of individual initiatives 


-  At National City ,  for instance ,  IT used to be closely aligned with the companys business units 


-  There were people who worked on retail projects ,  people who worked on wholesale projects and so on ,  said CIO McCartin 


-  But no one was looking out for the needs of the business as  whole: We could not do  big-ticket fix on our core systems because nobody would pick up the check 


-  McCartin reorganized IT to focus not on business units but on core processes and capabilities ,  such as lending and call centers 


-  That ,  said McCartin ,  has enabled us to create  multiyear transformation program ,  systematically replacing antiquated pieces of the system 


-  At the German wireless telecommunications company T-Mobile International AG  Co 


-  ,  for instance ,  head of IT Steffen Roehn meets with his counterparts on the business side every two weeks to define and redefine priorities for the next six to nine months 


-  But Roehn enforces  strict policy of no more than four new-technology releases per year 


-  Business sometimes has complaints  they want it faster ,  he said ,  but they have felt the benefits of the strict release cycles and the credibility and dependability they provide 


-  ,  Effectiveness is so important that companies snared in the alignment trap  those in the upper left  almost always find it better to move downward and rightward into well oiled territory first ,  temporarily focusing on effectiveness at the expense of alignment 


-  Effectiveness ,  after all ,  usually involves centralizing and simplifying  good part of the IT function 


-  That may mean giving up ,  for the moment ,  some of the division-specific applications that have been custom-tailored on legacy systems ,  just as De Beers and National City had to do 


-  ,  But the ultimate quest for  company is to move IT into the upper-right quadrant ,  where it is both highly effective and highly aligned ,  where IT spending is less than average but growth considerably higher ,  and where IT appears to be enabling growth rather than inhibiting it 


-  Enterprises that are IT-empowered in this way create an IT strategy and organization that fully support key business objectives 


-  Rather than simply create accountability around  discrete process ,  for instance ,  their governance crosses traditional organizational lines 


-  That makes it possible to create simpler and cheaper ,  yet more capable ,  systems than those of siloed organizations 


-  Then ,  too ,  business executives are highly engaged in systems projects ,  often taking lead responsibility for their success 


-  For its part ,  IT must be  highly reliable partner both in setting expectations around feasibility ,  time and cost and in delivering consistently 


-  ,  The combination of high effectiveness and high alignment is  plateau once occupied solely by pioneering companies such as FedEx ,  Wal-Mart and Dell 


-  IT allowed them to change the game ,  and to serve customers in ways that competitors could not 


-  Today ,   small number of companies continue to reach these heights one by one ,  some of them in industries that are not generally viewed as being IT-intensive 


-  Examining how they do it shows why the combination of effectiveness and alignment is so powerful 


-  ,  Nestl is one such company 


-  Nearly seven years ago ,  the worlds largest food and beverage company embarked on  project dubbed Global Business Excellence ,  or GLOBE 


-  The project collapsed dozens of ERP systems across multiple business units into one ,  establishing  common system design and template for the companys worldwide operations while still allowing differences for local markets 


-  Just as important ,  CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe gave Chris Johnson ,   business unit executive  not an IT executive  accountability for GLOBEs results 


-  GLOBE is really  business initiative ,  Johnson told CNN in an interview last year ,  adding that ,  were it strictly IT ,  I dont think [Brabeck-Letmathe] would have chosen me to run it 


-  ,  By 2006 ,  Johnson and the GLOBE team had standardized data management ,  systems and operating practices at 80% of Nestls  


-  businesses and saved the company $1 


-  This consolidation and simplification  effective IT  had dramatic ramifications 


-  Before GLOBE ,  the company has acknowledged ,  its production batch codes differed from one market to another and its customers were coded differently ,  so that it never really knew how much of any one product it was selling 


-  ( In fact ,  it didnt even know how many products it sold overall 


-  )  Meanwhile ,  about 56% of the data in its multiple information systems turned out to be garbage ,  causing anomalies such as salespeople attempting to promote discontinued products 


-  home-and-office water business alone saved $300 , 000  year 


-  ,  Brabeck-Letmathe also credits the IT-business transformation with empowering growth 


-  Because GLOBE is tightly aligned as the supply and customer-data platform for the whole business ,  the program intentionally does not track its benefits separately 


-  But it does put granular information at the fingertips of Nestl managers around the world ,  allowing them to manage their businesses more effectively 


-  Over the course of GLOBEs implementation ,  Nestl has seen revenues grow from $50 


-  Said Brabeck: I am absolutely convinced that GLOBE has catapulted us [to]  five-year competitive advantage [compared] to most fast-moving consumer-goods companies 


-  ,  Most of the successful companies that we interviewed  the companies that have at least begun the process of enabling growth through IT  regard the move into the upper right-hand quadrant as  continuing endeavor rather than  once-and-for-all process 


-  ,   large company based in Greenwood Village ,  Colorado ,  that provides  variety of back-end services to credit-card issuers and retailers 


-  First Data has grown rapidly in recent years ,  both organically and through acquisition 


-  Some of its clients wound up buying service packages from First Data that were built on two different  ( and incompatible )  platforms  an unsatisfactory arrangement from the clients point of view 


-  The client was saying ,  we want  single global solution ,  said David Dibble ,  executive vice president and chief technology officer 


-  ,  Much as Nestl did ,  Dibbles team resolved the problem by turning over the reins of IT governance to the business 


-  In First Datas case ,  the right business solution meant decoupling the companys products  service packages  from individual IT platforms 


-  ( A platform should not be  business ,  said Dibble 


-  The business is the business 


-  It has lowered costs and made the IT underpinnings of First Datas products more effective 


-  It has also enabled the company to make  sale and get  client up and running far faster than in the past ,  thus enabling growth 


-  His continuing challenge is to make sure that other senior managers understand the cost of not simplifying ,  both in immediate expense and in forgone growth 


-  But eventually ,  complexity can still creep back in 


-  One good early-warning indicator is the proportion of IT spending required for maintenance  keeping the lights on  as compared to product development 


-  If the ratio creeps up ,  the CIO or CTO can take that as  sign that its time for another round of simplification 


-  The companys Cambridge Initiative ,  launched in 2004 ,  is an advanced utility that enables active traders to track their trades and analyze their portfolios 


-  Unlike earlier IT projects at Schwab ,  it was created on  separate platform rather than overlaid on the corporate mainframe ,  and it came in on time and on budget 


-  Perhaps more important ,  it provided customers with additional value while reducing Schwabs costs to competitive levels: Overall cost per trade was reduced more than 50% ,  while average time to execute trades at peak times decreased 80% 


-  Clients showed their approval by increasing their trades and bringing more assets to bear ,  reigniting Schwabs growth 


-  ,  These companies and others have learned to interrupt the downward spiral that plagues so many IT organizations with  clear recipe for successful IT enablement 


-  In our experience and research ,  the companies that achieve the highest growth at  low cost manage complexity down ,  source IT staffing and software wherever it makes the most sense and create start-to-finish accountability connected to business results 


-  Then ,  and only then ,  the best performers tightly align their entire IT organization to the strategic objectives of the overall business ,  using governance principles that cross organizational lines and making business executives responsible for key IT initiatives 


-  With IT both effective and aligned ,  these companies have put IT where it belongs in the 21st century: at the heart of the business processes that define  companys position in the marketplace 


- Innovation is becoming an increasingly open process thanks to  growing division of labor 


-  One company develops  novel idea but does not bring it to market 


-  Instead ,  the company decides to partner with or sell the idea to another party ,  which then commercializes it 


-  To get the most out of this new system of innovation ,  companies must open their business models by actively searching for and exploiting outside ideas and by allowing unused internal technologies to flow to the outside ,  where other firms can unlock their latent economic potential 


-  ,  Lets be clear about what is meant by the term business model 


-  In essence ,   business model performs two important functions: It creates value ,  and it captures  portion of that value 


-  The first function requires the defining of  series of activities  ( from raw materials through to the final customer )  that will yield  new product or service ,  with value being added throughout the various activities 


-  The second function requires the establishing of  unique resource ,  asset or position within that series of activities in which the firm enjoys  competitive advantage 


-  ,  Open business models enable an organization to be more effective in creating as well as capturing value 


-  They help create value by leveraging many more ideas because of their inclusion of  variety of external concepts 


-  They also allow greater value capture by utilizing  firms key asset ,  resource or position not only in that organizations own operations but also in other companies businesses 


-  ,  To appreciate the potential of this new approach ,  consider the following names: Qualcomm Inc 


-  ,  the maker of cellular phone technology; Genzyme Corp 


-  ,   biotechnology company; The Procter  Gamble Co 


-  ,   consumer products corporation; and Chicago ,  the musical stage show and movie 


-  This assortment might appear to be random ,  but they all have something in common: Each required an open business model in which an idea traveled from invention to commercialization through at least two different companies ,  with the different parties involved dividing the work of innovation 


-  Through the process ,  ideas and technologies were bought ,  sold ,  licensed or otherwise transferred ,  changing hands at least once in their journey to market 


-  ,  Qualcomm used to make its own cell phones and base stations but ceased doing so years ago 


-  Now others manufacture those products ,  and Qualcomm just makes chips and sells licenses to its technologies ,  period 


-  In fact ,  every phone that uses its technology is sold by  customer of Qualcomm ,  not by the company itself 


-  ,  Genzyme licenses technology from the outside and then develops it in-house 


-  The company has turned these external ideas into an array of novel therapies that deliver important cures for previously untreatable rare diseases 


-  It has also built an impressive financial record in an industry in which profits have been difficult to achieve 


-  ,  Procter  Gamble has rejuvenated its growth through  program called Connect and Develop ,  which licenses or acquires products from other companies and brings them to market as P&G brands 


-  With early successes like the Crest SpinBrush ,  Olay Regenerist and Swiffer Dusters ,  P&G now actively seeks external ideas and technologies through an extensive network of scouts 


-  Others saw the latent value within the work and revived it multiple times to yield  prize-winning show 


-  And each time the show was revived ,  it was done by  different owner 


-  Different companies possess different assets ,  resources and market positions ,  and each has  unique history 


-  Because of that ,  companies look at opportunities differently 


-  They will quickly recognize ideas that fit the pattern that has proven successful for them in the past ,  but they will struggle with concepts that require an unfamiliar configuration of assets ,  resources and positions 


-  With innovation markets ,  ideas can flow out of places where they do not fit and find homes in companies where they do 


-  ,  In many industries ,  markets for innovation have existed for  long time 


-  In the chemical industry ,  for instance ,  compounds have often moved from one company to another 


-  Even now ,  much of the exchange of technology and its associated intellectual property occurs through  cottage industry of brokers and patent attorneys 


-  Although transactions do occur ,  the price and other terms of the transactions are difficult to discern 


-  This makes it difficult to determine the overall size of activity and to know what the fair price is for  particular technology 


-  ,  And ,  of course ,  in highly inefficient markets  good deal of potentially valuable trade in innovation does not occur 


-  The costs are so high and the potential value so difficult to perceive that innovation often sits on the shelf ,  unused 


-  One way to quantify this waste is to look at  companys patent utilization rate  the number of patents that the firm uses in its business divided by the total number of patents that it owns 


-  In an informal survey ,   have found that companies utilize less than half of their patented technologies in at least one of their businesses 


-  Thus ,  in my admittedly unscientific sampling ,  somewhere between 75% and 95% of patented technologies are simply dormant 


-  ,  An important factor spurring the process of open innovation is the rising cost of technology development in many industries 


-  Case in point: the soaring cost of building  semiconductor fabrication facility ,  or fab 


-  Each was estimated to cost more than $3 billion 


-  Just 20 years ago ,   new fab would have cost about 1% of that 


-  Even the consumer products industry is feeling the pressure 


-  P&G estimates that its Always brand of feminine hygiene pads ,  which cost $10 million to develop  decade ago ,  would set the company back anywhere from $20 million to $50 million today ,  according to Jeff Weedman ,  who is responsible for external business development at P&G 


-  ,  The rising costs of technology development would imply that only the big will get bigger ,  with everyone else falling behind 


-  But theres  second force at play: the shortening life cycles of new products 


-  In the computer industry during the early 1980s ,  for example ,  hard disk drives would typically ship for four to six years ,  after which  new and better product became available 


-  By the late 1980s ,  the expected shipping life had fallen to two to three years 


-  ,  In pharmaceuticals ,  the expected shipping life of new drugs while they enjoy patent protection has shortened because of longer testing procedures and quicker entry by manufacturers of generics 


-  And in the largest market segments ,  successful drugs must often contend with  number of rival products 


-  ,  As  result of both trends  rising development costs and shorter product life cycles  companies are finding it increasingly difficult to justify investments in innovation 


-  ( See The Economic Pressures on Innovation 


-  )  Open business models address both effects 


-  It attacks the cost side of the problem by leveraging external research-and-development resources to save time and money in the innovation process 


-  Consider P&Gs6 Pringles Print initiative ,  through which the company now offers Pringles with pictures and words printed on each chip 


-  To bring that product to market ,  P&G found and adapted an ink jet technology that  bakery in Bologna ,  Italy ,  used to print messages on cakes and cookies 


-  P&G developed Pringles Print at  fraction of the cost and brought it to market in half the time than it would have taken had the company done all the work internally 


-  ,  Open business models also attack the revenue side 


-  P&G ,  for instance ,  is creating new brands by licensing technologies from other companies around the world ,  resulting in products like the SpinBrush ,   battery-operated toothbrush ,  which generated first-year sales of $200 million 


-  And P&G is also getting money from licensing its technologies to other firms 


-  ,  The combination of leveraged cost and time savings with new revenue opportunities confers powerful advantages for companies willing to open their business models 


-  )  The development costs of innovation are reduced by the greater use of external technology in  firms own R&D process 


-  This saves time as well as money 


-  Now it participates in other segments through licensing fees ,  joint ventures and spinoffs ,  among other means 


-  These different streams of income create more overall revenue from the innovation 


-  The result is that innovation becomes economically attractive again ,  even in  world of shorter product life cycles 


-  ,  What can companies do to partake more fully in the benefits of open innovation? The short answer is that they need to develop the ability to experiment with their business models 


-  Developing that capability requires the creation of processes for conducting experiments and for assessing their results 


-  Although that might seem obvious ,  many companies simply do not have such processes in place 


-  In most organizations ,  no single person short of the chief executive officer bears responsibility for the business model 


-  Instead ,  business unit managers  ( who are usually posted to their jobs for just two to three years )  tend to take the business model for granted 


-  For them ,  running risky experiments in which the payoffs may not emerge for three or more years is not  high priority 


-  ,  Companies also face certain constraints 


-  The same is true for companies with respect to their distribution channels ,  manufacturing strategies and so on 


-  But some companies have developed tactics to work around such limitations 


-  Consider ,  for instance ,   food manufacturer that is exploring ways to provide healthier but shelf-stable foods and snacks in high school vending machines 


-  To experiment with different products without risking any damage to its consumer brand ,  the manufacturer has created  white box brand that is not advertised ,  is not supported and has no obvious connection to the company 


-  ,  the online search company ,  has established  separate Web site  ( www 


- com )  that allows the firm to get consumer feedback on new approaches to user interfaces 


-  Other ways of exploring are through spinning off companies or investing in startups 


-  By observing how well  small organization does with  particular business model ,   company can obtain much useful information about the viability of that model 


-  ,  To understand how an organization can open its business model ,  consider the recent efforts of IBM ,  P&G and Air Products and Chemicals ,  three companies that operate in different industries with vastly different technologies and products 


-  Each used to function with  very internally focused ,  closed business model 


-  And each has since migrated to  business model that is substantially more open 


-  ,  Much has been written about the arrival of Lou Gerstner ,  former CEO at IBM ,  and the subsequent changes to the companys business model under his direction 


-  But the journey that IBM took to get to its new business model has not been widely reported 


-  In the beginning of its transformation ,  IBM shrank its bloated overhead structure and staunched the companys financial bleeding by implementing  massive layoff and write-off of corporate assets 


-  After that radical ,  short-term surgery ,  groups within IBM began to search fervently for new revenue sources 


-  ,  In the semiconductor business ,  one experiment was to offer IBMs own semiconductor lines as  foundry for other companies products 


-  ,  Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd 


-  of Singapore and other firms to share the high costs and significant risks of developing leading-edge semiconductor processes 


-  Now IBM breaks even  ( or even makes  little money )  in an area where the company had been losing tens of millions of dollars each year 


-  ,  IBM also rethought its whole approach to managing intellectual property ,  especially with respect to patents and technology 


-  Shifting from  defensive approach  ( focused on preventing the leakage of IP )  to an offensive one  ( focused on licensing IP to outside parties )  ,  the company was able to generate significant new revenues 


-  Case in point: IBMs semiconductor copper-on-insulator process technology ,  which provides higher-speed circuitry with greater manufacturing reliability 


-  In the past ,  this technology would have likely been kept under wraps at IBM 


-  But with the companys new approach to IP ,  it has been widely  and profitably  licensed to companies such as Intel ,  Motorola  ( now Freescale Semiconductor of Austin ,  Texas )  and Texas Instruments 


-  ,  Other experiments were being conducted in the software area 


-  In the 1990s ,  IBM had been losing market share to UNIX  ( controlled by The Open Group )  and Microsoft Windows NT operating systems ,  and the company was aware that these products had key strategic importance in determining the direction of new technologies and architectures for enterprise computing 


-  And enterprise computing was IBMs bread and butter 


-  ,  It was in this context that some IBM programmers and managers were evaluating the Linux operating system 


-  Linux by itself would hardly solve IBMs revenue problems 


-  ( Because the code base was available to anyone basically for free ,  it lacked the ability to generate income for IBM the way that Windows NT had done for Microsoft 


-  )  But Linux did offer IBM  way to cut development costs while still maintaining some control over the operating system 


-  IBM now spends about $100 million on Linux development each year ,  just  fraction of what it used to spend on  proprietary operating system 


-   ( The rest of the more than $800 million needed to develop and maintain Linux for commercial purposes comes from other companies involved in the Open Source Development Labs 


-  )  ,  As  testament to IBMs commitment to open innovation ,  the company recently donated 500 of its software patents to the open source community 


-  The intent was to increase the intellectual commons available for the further development of open source software 


-  The donation will likely be followed by additional ones from IBM and has already elicited copycat gifts from Computer Associates of Islandia ,  New York ,  and Sun Microsystems Inc 


-  ,  In the late 1990s ,  Durk Jager ,  the CEO of P&G ,  started  number of initiatives designed to restore the companys growth 


-  Although many of them were helpful in rethinking P&Gs business ,  they created significant disruptions in the day-to-day running of the company and also took time to bear fruit 


-  To make matters worse ,  P&Gs existing businesses began to slip 


-  During 1999 and the first part of 2000 ,  the company missed  number of consecutive quarterly earnings forecasts ,  causing its stock to plunge from more than $110 per share to half that amount in less than half  year 


-  On June  ,  2000 ,  Jager departed and  


-  Lafley ,  who was running P&Gs North American beauty care business ,  was brought in to replace him 


-  ,  Lafley worked with Gil Cloyd ,  P&Gs chief technology officer ,  to get the company to accelerate its growth by opening its innovation process to external sources of technology 


-  Under the Connect and Develop initiative ,  Lafley proclaimed that in five years P&G would receive half of its ideas from the outside and ,  to achieve that ambitious target ,  he formed an R&D team under the leadership of Larry Huston ,  the vice president of R&D innovation and knowledge 


-  Technology scouts at P&G had learned about the SpinBrush technology and convinced the company to acquire it from Dr 


-  ,  Through SpinBrush and other similar deals ,  P&G was able to tap into  cost-effective means of spurring its innovation activities 


-  According to Huston , 10 I set  goal with my boss to double our innovation capacity at no increase in costs 


-  At the start of that initiative ,  P&G had roughly  , 200 people working on innovations:  , 500 inside the company ,  400 with suppliers and around 300 external people 


-  Now ,  according to Huston ,  P&G has increased that number to about 16 , 500 


-  We still have  , 500 internally ,  says Huston ,  but now we have  , 000 with suppliers and  , 000 virtual and extended partners 


-  ,  Many of Air Products offerings are mature industrial chemicals ,  yet this $7 


-  billion company has quietly refashioned itself into  leader in innovation 


-  The primary impetus for that transformation was  proposed merger in which Air Products and  competitor ,  LAir Liquide  


-  Air Products realized ,  though ,  that it didnt need the merger to implement some new ideas for  novel way to innovate and compete 


-  ,  To that end ,  John Tao ,   30-year veteran of Air Products ,  began to change the companys approach to licensing its technology 


-  At first ,  he simply asked the CEO for six months to benchmark how other firms were managing their intellectual assets so that he could develop an out-licensing program for Air Products 


-  I didnt ask for large amounts of money on purpose ,  he explains 


-  I thought that if  requested  lot of money before we knew what we were doing ,   would be [making] the program &mldr; an easy target for some future cost-cutting meeting 


-  Fortunately ,  Tao was able to score some early successes ,  including the licensing of  burner technology for reducing nitrous oxide emissions from industrial combustion 


-  ,  Air Products has also changed its process for developing technologies for its own business 


-  It has shifted from doing all the research and commercialization activity in-house to  model in which the company partners with others 


-  An example of that is Air Products approach to nanotechnology ,  in which the company has developed powerful ways to manipulate nanoscale particles in different materials 


-  But instead of commercializing these technologies on its own ,  the company has partnered with the  


-  According to Martha Collins ,  technology director for Air Products ,  The keys to successful nano projects are alliances and partnerships in the spirit of open innovation 


- 11 ,  Each of the three companies began the journey toward  more open business model with  shock or challenge to the status quo 


-  For IBM ,  the shock was so severe that the company was nearly broken up 


-  In the case of P&G ,  its stock had fallen in half and  new CEO had been brought in 


-  Air Products did not face the brutal financial adjustments that IBM and P&G did ,  but  potential merger triggered  deep self-examination of how the company did business 


-  ,  Generally speaking ,  making fundamental changes to  companys business model requires clear commitment and support from the top 


-  Either way ,  the important thing is to build and maintain momentum by continually supplying evidence that supports the transformation and shows that the company is heading in the right direction 


-  This requires repeated experimentation in which the firm pursues new sources of revenue and business value and collects critical information from the market about the potential value of those ideas and technologies 


-  At P&G ,  for example ,  the early successes of the SpinBrush and Swiffer products provided ample proof within the company that Connect and Develop could generate strong bottom-line results 


-  ,  Of course ,  experimentation only yields value when  company is able  ( and willing )  to act on the information that the experiments generate 


-  Larry Hustons early success at P&G with insourcing exter nal products showed that there was money to be made ,  but it was Gil Cloyd and  


-  Lafley who realized that this new logic could transform P&Gs business model and boost its overall growth rate 


- 12 Air Products experience to date is helping the company to rethink how it might finance the high fixed capital investments needed in the industrial chemicals business 


-  As Gus Orphanides ,  director of licensing at Air Products ,  explains ,  We used to be  huge [capital expenditure] company ,  perhaps spending $1 billion  year for  $6 billion company 


-  We started to ask ourselves ,  Are we getting enough of  return on our shareholders capital?  Today ,  Air Products is actively seeking creative ways to share those costs with other firms 


-  ,  When building  new business model ,  companies must figure out what to do with their existing model 


-  Praising  new business model can inadvertently suggest that the current one is somehow obsolete 


-  But the traditional business model can continue to play an important role 


-  P&G ,  for instance ,  still develops its own brands and invests substantially in its internal technologies 


-  ,  Managing the coexistence of  new business model alongside an existing one can be tricky 


-  Indeed ,  when Durk Jager of P&G tried to push too many change initiatives at once ,  P&G did begin to transform itself but lost the operational discipline to deliver the quarterly earnings numbers that investors expected 


-  Nevertheless ,  as successful experiments begin to point the way toward  new and more effective business model ,  the company must undergo  final phase in its transformation 


-  In this stage ,  the firm will scale up the model ,  bringing it into high volume across the organization and its customers 


-  ,  First ,  the business model must be adjusted or rebuilt to handle significant volume 


-  Many business models that work well when only  small number of highly trained people are involved can easily break down when new layers of administration are needed to manage  much larger number of more general workers 


-  IBM faces this concern in its global consulting business 


-  The skills of its services personnel differ from those of its product and technology people ,  and IBM now needs many more of the former  ( specifically ,  people who can translate customer IT requirements into specific solutions from IBM )  and fewer of the latter  ( device physicists and polymer chemists )  


-  Second ,  the business model must obtain buy in from important constituencies before being rolled out across the company 


-  Scaling up  business model requires much more funding and far greater organizational commitment than  small experiment does ,  and those resources must come from somewhere 


-  This often creates losers in the organization  groups whose budgets are cut to free up resources to support the new business model 


-  Because of that ,  the scaling-up process can encounter tremendous internal resistance 


-  The initial program required few resources and minimal management attention ,  thus it triggered little conflict with other parts of the organization 


-  Of course ,  as the program continued to expand ,  it led to greater competition for resources 


-  Now ,  though ,  Taos efforts have an established history of bringing in new revenues ,  which have been shared with the associated business units 


-  This additional income has minimized any internal resistance because theres now  bigger pie to share ,  and Taos proven track record has given him more clout in the discussions over how to divide that pie 


-  ,  Many organizations have encountered the type of upheaval that IBM ,  P&G and Air Products faced ,  but few have engaged in the breadth of experimentation that those companies did as they searched for  new business model 


- 13 Indeed ,  it takes courage and vision to try out new ideas during  time of financial difficulty 


-  Yet absent such experiments ,  companies could easily fall into  cycle of slowing revenues ,  leading to head count and expense reductions ,  which trigger further business declines ,  resulting in still more cuts 


-  in the automotive industry  companies whose market shares have been in  slow ,  inexorable retreat since the oil shocks of the 1970s  to see this vicious cycle in action 


- 14 The alternative solution of opening up  companys business model may not be easy ,  but if diligently pursued ,  it provides  potential pathway to greater innovation activity and increased growth 


- Over the last decade ,  the Internet has transformed many aspects of the way business is conducted  from how goods are bought and sold to where work is done 


-  To explore what might constitute the next generation of Web technologies and what effect they will have on the nature ,  purpose and management of organizations ,  MIT Sloan Management Review contributing editor Martha  


-  McAfee ,  associate professor of business administration in the Technology and Operations Management Unit at Harvard Business School 


-  ,  Looking ahead to the next year or two ,  what do you think are some of the most important ways in which the Web  and in particular so-called Web  


-  technologies  will continue to change the way business is done? ,  Brynjolfsson:  expect  big thematic change in the way people have been using the technology 


-  Because of the recession in 20012002 and really ,  frankly ,  some overspending in the late 90s ,  there was for several years  focus within corporations on cost-cutting and using the Internet to save money ,  gain efficiencies and improve productivity 


-  technology to support innovation ,  creativity ,  collaboration and information sharing 


-  When it comes to what CIOs are asked to focus on ,  theres  bit of  cycle that parallels the business cycle 


-  Going forward over the next year or two ,   see  focus on using the Web to grow revenues and foster innovation  as opposed to  focus on cutting costs 


-  There are several trends going on  some of which have been going on for some time ,  some of which have started to accelerate recently  that support this flowering of collaboration and innovation and creativity that we are seeing on the Web 


-  One trend is that the cost of participating on the Web continues to plummet 


-  Processing ,  bandwidth ,  storage and memory all just continue to get cheaper and cheaper 


-  Its also getting  lot less expensive to contribute to the Web or to build an industrial-strength Web site 


-  ,  In addition ,  expertise barriers to putting content on the Web have basically vanished 


-  If you get  Blogger account ,  you dont need even basic HTML skills to start getting your thoughts up on the Web 


-  Anyone with an Internet connection can play on the Web in all the ways they want to now 


-  And that contributes to this flowering of innovation and creativity 


-  For example ,  you dont have to be  climate change expert to edit the Wikipedia entry on global warming ,  but maybe Wikipedia would be better if people focused on areas where they had something to contribute 


-  ,  We need innovation not just in the technology but innovation in some of the institutions that manage the collaboration and that manage  global community working on problems 


-  The question is: Is there  way that we can create an institution or  set of institutions where the right answers emerge consistently from collaborative efforts? ,  McAfee: We dont have  lot of experience with how to do that 


-  Were used to the forms of organization weve had for  long time 


-  The Web  this worldwide ,  zeroincremental cost network that weve built  gives us  lot of opportunities 


-  ,  Im not saying that the complete level playing field that the Internet makes possible is  great idea in all cases 


-  But the business opportunity it presents is to create the architecture of participation  the ground rules of the game  so that the good material emerges 


-  ,  One place where weve seen Internet-based collaboration work effectively is open-source software development 


-  Is that an interesting model for how this type of collaboration might play out in other industries? ,  Brynjolfsson: Its very interesting and its an example of  broader phenomenon that has sometimes been called the gift economy 


-  There are  lot of knowledge workers who contribute what they have to offer not necessarily for purely financial motives but because of  whole set of motivations psychologists can tell you we all have 


- com or some of the travel sites 


-  ,  McAfee: What were seeing is just how deep-rooted that desire is to do several things: to share ,  to communicate ,  to get your expertise out there and to do what Ward Cunningham ,  who invented wiki technology ,  called authoring 


-  ,  Lets talk  little bit about the process of how the good material  good content ,  good ideas  can filter up 


-  ,  McAfee: When  talk to corporate audiences ,   usually start with the technological mechanisms that let good stuff emerge 


-  If you let people author Web content and you let them interlink ,  the cream is going to rise to the top in  sense; the most popular content is going to be very evident very quickly 


-  You have great incentive to be helpful ,  rather than harmful ,  if you want your contributions to last 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: The examples Andy is giving are examples of  broader phenomenon that Tom Malone ,  my colleague at the MIT Sloan School ,  is calling collective intelligence 


-  Malone recently founded the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence to try to understand the common themes between iniatives like Wikipedia and Google 


-  He points out that its not just that Google has  clever search algorithm and some powerful servers; its that theres  tremendous amount of structure in the Web itself that people create every time they add  link to one of their pages 


-  That collective intelligence is what Google leverages so effectively 


-  tools within their organizations? ,  McAfee: The first piece of advice Id give is that you might want to rethink your infrastructure for collaboration and communication 


-  ,  Which technologies ,  specifically ,  do you think are the low-hanging fruit for corporate executives to consider? ,  McAfee: The ones that  try to get managers excited about these days are those that let people express the desire they have to contribute or publish for  broad audience 


-  These are low-risk ,  low-cost experiments 


-  technologies within  corporation could be described as if we build it ,  they will come 


-  infrastructure ,  then youre going to get great emergent phenomenon  an internal Google-level search and  Wikipedia-level internal collaboration environment 


-  The main reason that doesnt happen is that the number of people who are actually contributing content to the Web  as opposed to passively consuming it  is  tiny ,  tiny percentage of all Web users 


-  You scale that down to enterprise size ,  and theres essentially no one participating in what  call the Enterprise  


-  tools within companies 


-  The managers job is to increase the ambient level of participation in and contribution to these Enterprise  


-  ,  How do you go about doing that? ,  McAfee: The economists would say you provide incentives to do it  whether hard or soft incentives ,  cultural ones or monetary ones 


-  One of the simplest and most effective techniques Ive seen  and Ive seen it over and over  is for  boss to just say ,  Im not reading any e-mails about this project; put all your information up on the wiki where we can all see it and use it 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: Paradoxically ,  some of the most powerful incentives can be created when you simply take away undue structure and constraints 


-  Youre also going to see  lot more potentially useful connections emerge organically 


-  ,  This doesnt come costlessly 


-  One of the benefits of the organization of  corporation is the potential for streamlining and efficiency that hierarchy brings to bear 


-  Ultimately ,  its  trade-off in terms of where you want to be on that creativity vs 


-  The nice thing is that innovations in technology and in organizational design are allowing us to push out the frontier of that trade-off ,  so that you can get more innovation without sacrificing efficiency to the same degree 


-  ,  McAfee:  dont think Erik believes ,  and  certainly dont believe ,  that everyone should abandon hierarchy and abandon any element of command and control inside an organization 


-  An existing company can take advantage of both the benefits of imposing structure and hierarchy and some level of managerial intervention while simultaneously getting out of the way in other areas and letting the lateralization and the diagonal innovation emerge 


-  And  dont think that its naive to expect that both of these phenomena can happen  just as its not naive for an organization to have an ERP [Enterprise Resource Planning] system and  wiki at the same time 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: In fact ,   think  lot of the ERP systems and the process-management tools that are often considered to be antithetical to wikis can be very complementary or synergistic with the collaborative tools 


-  Andy and  are working on  paper now called Scale Without Mass that looks at how you can leverage creativity and new ideas through business process replication by using tools like ERP and CRM [customer relationship management] 


-  The idea is that when somebody comes up with an innovation ,  you can use these process-management tools to much more rapidly replicate and disseminate the new ideas throughout the company on  global basis 


-  There are  number of examples of companies doing that 


-  That is  good example of this trade-off between innovation and efficiency being much less severe than it used to be 


-  ,  McAfee: Weve got one set of tools that allow the good ideas to percolate up to the top ,  and then you can use these very structured process-management technologies to replicate the innovation 


-  One way to think about managers role in this era is that they grab the good ideas that percolate up and then propagate them throughout the organization  with brutal efficiency in some cases 


-  Can you give some examples of that phenomenon? ,  Brynjolfsson: When Amazon comes up with  better shopping experience for its customers ,  the improvement may involve changing  few lines of code or rearranging of some pixels  and ,  instantly ,  millions of people have  new shopping experience on each of their desktops ,  all over the world 


-  Amazon is constantly doing experiments to see if the company can improve the shopping experience by  few tenths of  percent in terms of the yield and efficiency 


-  At  Web-based company ,  its pretty easy to see how creativity can be quickly leveraged to millions of store locations ,  if you will 


-  The same thing is true for software firms or other companies that replicate their products and services digitally 


-  CVS improved its business process for ordering prescription drugs and then ,  within the course of  year ,  replicated the improvement at more than  , 000 retail locations 


-  Thats something that wouldnt have been doable before firms had  technology platform already in place for implementing and disseminating the innovation 


-  ,  In the CVS case ,  did that innovation come about through the use of Web  


-  collaborative technologies? ,  McAfee: That particular innovation at CVS came from  cross-functional team brought together to solve  problem 


-  What were seeing more generally ,  though ,  is that  lot of clever ideas now are percolating up via some combination of people and technology  and then theyre propagated throughout the organization 


-  Companies in very turbulent ,  very information-intensive industries tend to be the ones that have gone the furthest with deploying the new Enterprise  


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: In addition to structural changes ,  there are also some softer ,  cultural things that companies can do 


-  Google ,  for example ,  has  norm that all employees are supposed to spend about 10% of their time on new ideas that arent related to Googles main products 


-  The company gives employees remarkable freedom as to how unrelated those projects and ideas can be 


-  Thats something that Google can afford to do in part because the company has been successful ,  so  real test would be whether  company that didnt have margins like Googles could afford to offer that kind of freedom 


-  ,  McAfee: Ive also talked to  few different professional services firms about the Enterprise  


-  Like Google ,  those firms are also very successful ,  very high-margin businesses 


-  But the soft shift  the cultural shift for them  theyre finding difficult to execute ,  in part because their focus for so long has been on billable hours and on classic notions of productivity and output 


-  And  think that neither Erik nor  see any technology that will by itself resolve that dilemma 


-  ,  One of the things that  find interesting about these technologies is that you can draw the boundaries around them wherever you want 


-  Use them purely for one lab or one work group  great 


-  Or use them companywide  great 


-  Include all of your customers ,  suppliers and users  great 


-  With these technologies ,  you can very easily select the scale of community you want 


-  ,  My colleague Karim Lakhani and  are writing  case study right now about Cambrian House Inc 


-  ,   software development company based in Calgary ,  Alberta ,  thats drawing the boundary very widely 


-  The company leaders have stopped saying they know what software they should develop next 


-  The company commits to at least test the products that win  to build them to the point where the company can see whether the products will succeed in the market 


-  Cambrian House will give each months tournament winners some share of any future profits on that software product 


-  The company also partitions out the coding tasks not only to its own employees but also to the community of people who know about the company and come to its site; the company offers these outside coders  share of the products profits 


-  Cambrian House is partially outsourcing both idea generation for new products and then product creation 


-  What the company does is sit in the middle ,  coordinate all those activities ,  get the software to market and then partition out the proceeds that result 


-  ,  So theyve essentially viewed their core competency as managing their community 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: In general ,  the whole concept of internal and external [to the corporation] is becoming  lot blurrier 


-  And thats again ,  partly ,  because of these kinds of tools 


-  Part of this goes back to the basic economics about what it means to be an employee 


-  For example ,  its difficult for an assembly-line worker at General Motors to create value at home ,  without access to the companys capital equipment 


-  But 150 years ago ,  craft workers did work with their own capital ,  and they had  lot more autonomy and independence 


-  Today ,  in many ways were coming back to that type of arrangement ,  where knowledge workers ,  who work with their own human capital and perhaps access to the companys technology infrastructure that they can easily get from home ,  can create  tremendous amount of value for  company 


-  Employee/independent contractor distinctions are less relevant for that kind of worker and that kind of firm 


-  ,  The traditional corporate organization was tremendously successful throughout the 20th century 


-  But ,  as we said at the outset ,  the technology innovations are engendering  whole set of complementary innovations in organizations 


-  ,  McAfee: Some people who get really enthusiastic about the new Web technologies say that they render managers obsolete ,  or that we are going to have  completely self-organizing economy 


-  But what were saying is that we find that these changes actually heighten the role of managers and executives ,  who need to think about how to organize and compete in the new environment 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: Its not  question of complete decentralization or complete centralization 


-  Instead ,  we see companies simultaneously using centralization and decentralization in different aspects of their businesses 


-  Ive learned  lot from Andys case study about Zara ,  the fashion retailer that is part of the Inditex Group ,  based in  Corua ,  Spain 


-  Zaras example highlights how even  light touch of technology can radically change the way  company or an industry works 


-  ,  McAfee: Erik and  both find Zara  really interesting company 


-  In  very vertically disintegrated industry  apparel manufacturing and retailing  where everyone else outsources to low-wage countries ,  Zara is very vertically integrated 


-  The company controls warehouses ,  cutting facilities and distribution centers and owns its stores 


-  Zaras management pursues that strategy because they want the company to be fast ,  and they want to react to changing fashion trends in  couple of weeks  as opposed to in six months 


-  In particular ,  Zara has decentralized decisions about which clothes should be in each store 


-  Headquarters decides what goods are available ,  in what quantities and at what price ,  and transmits this information to all the stores twice  week 


-  The stores then decide what they actually want and use the same technology to transmit those decisions to headquarters ,  where the decisions are all added up 


-  Theres this constant back and forth of information that helps the designers at Zara come up with the right new models and then get them into the right stores 


-  ,  Its clearly another form of collective intelligence 


-  While many companies in Zaras industry rely on very sophisticated software ,  genius designers or marketing to forecast or create demand ,  Zara does essentially none of that 


-  The company in effect says ,  Store managers ,  you tell us what people are going to wear for the next few weeks; then well build it and get it to you 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: This example highlights  trade-off between local and central knowledge that exists in every industry 


-  And technology is allowing companies to move that knowledge back and forth much more rapidly 


-  In Zaras case ,  those local store managers have on-the-spot information that would be impossible for someone at headquarters to really understand 


-  Its even almost impossible for the local store managers to communicate it ,  because theres so much subtlety to it 


-  On the other hand ,  what can be communicated pretty easily are production schedules and availability 


-  If its qualitative ,  is it distributed? Does it have to remain distributed? The new technology toolkit gives managers  lot of options for thinking through that golden rule 


-  ,  Brynjolfsson: In many dimensions ,  its very difficult to make predictions about the next five years 


-  But the technology side is oddly predictable 


-  Were quite confident that were going to have  continuation of Moores Law on the processor side and comparable improvements in memory ,  communications speed and storage 


-  That means that the bottleneck  the real place where theres room to make excess returns if youre an entrepreneur or  manager or  venture capitalist  is in finding creative ways to use those technologies 


-  Bank on  tenfold improvement in the next five years in most of those technologies  just mentioned 


-  Now ask yourself: What will you be able to do differently given that tenfold improvement in cost or capability? ,  We are very far from exploiting the full potential of the technology 


-  The set of technologies we have floating around today are fodder for at least  decade or two worth of organizational innovations  let alone the tenfold improvements were going to see in the next five years
