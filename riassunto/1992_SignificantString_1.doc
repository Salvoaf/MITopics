- During the past decade ,  many firms have concluded that information is one of their most critical business resources and that broadening information access and usage and enhancing its quality are key to improving business performance 


-  The information-based organization ,  the knowledge-based enterprise ,  and the learning organization ,  forecasted by management experts ,  all require  free flow of information around the firm 


-  Yet the rhetoric and technology of information management have far outpaced the ability of people to understand and agree on what information they need and then to share it 


-  ,  Today ,  in fact ,  the information-based organization is largely  fantasy 


-   didnt understand them 


-  The primary reason is that the companies did not manage the politics of information 


-  Only when information politics are viewed as  natural aspect of organizational life and consciously managed will true information-based organizations emerge 


-  As peoples jobs and roles become defined by the unique information they hold ,  they may be less likely to share that information  viewing it as  source of power and indispensability  rather than more so 


-  Yet they may have quite legitimate reasons for withholding the information 


-  Political behavior regarding information should be viewed not as irrational or inappropriate but as  normal response to certain organizational situations 


-  Getting the product to the end-customer was direct marketings sale; getting it to the distributor ,  even though it might return eventually ,  was how the indirect group wanted to measure its success 


-  Later ,  as more product moved directly to buyers ,  end-customer sales became the official definition 


-  ,  One reason the stakes are so high in information politics is that more than information is at stake 


-  At  fast-growing specialty manufacturer ,  CEO-appointed information czars are responsible for ensuring consistency in the information-generating activities of their areas 


-  For example ,  the order-processing czar mandated common companywide practices for assigning customer and product numbers ,  recognizing revenue ,  and determining contract prices 


-  ,  customer fulfillment )  are being redesigned to build  new information infrastructure 


-  Out of each new process will come information on its performance  how long it takes ,  how much it costs ,  how satisfied the customer is with it  as well as the more traditional results-oriented information such as sales and profitability 


-  At Dow Chemical ,  managers believe there must be common financial processes around the world in order to create common measures of financial performance 


-  Unfortunately ,  the very factors that make free information flow most desirable and necessary also make it less likely 


-  ,  Our purpose is to help companies understand information politics and manage them 


-  After we define each model ,  we will evaluate their relative effectiveness along the dimensions of information quality ,  efficiency ,  commonality ,  and access 


-  The first step in managing information more effectively and realistically is explicitly recognizing these existing models and then choosing  single desired state 


-  ,  Many companies have  strong bias toward approaching information management from  technological perspective 


-  Their technological efforts to alleviate information problems often involve  considerable amount of detailed planning and revolve around modeling and efficient use of corporate data 


-  Some technical efforts around information management are reasonable; however ,  when the technological approach to information predominates ,  the companys model of information management can be described as technocratic utopianism 


-  In fact ,  information itself  its content ,  use ,  and implications for managing receives little attention in this model 


-  ,  We found technocratic utopianism ,  either by itself or alongside another model ,  in almost  third of the firms we analyzed 


-  The model usually coexists ,  however uneasily ,  with other models; in fact ,  the technocratic utopian model is often held by  small group of technologists supported by many technical journals ,  consultants ,  and technology vendors 


-  Because these technical models are difficult for nontechnologists to understand ,  managers outside the IS function are rarely active participants 


-  ,  Technocratic utopians often have three factors in common: they focus heavily on information modeling and categorization; they highly value emerging hardware and software technologies; and they attempt to address an organizations entire information inventory 


-  They consider such modeling and categorization  key aspect of the engineering of information  ( indeed ,  information engineering is an established discipline within the IS profession )  


-  ,  Information engineering is important ,  of course ,  but the political aspects cannot be neglected 


-  Those knowledgeable about the back-room politics involved in bringing water to Los Angeles or about Robert Mosess political steamrolling in New Yorks water management will understand the role of politics in managing  natural resource like information 


-  ,  Technologists also frequently assert that new forms of hardware and software are the keys to information success 


-  Too often ,  however ,  when the silver bullet arrives it does not have the intended effect 


-  In fact ,  we would argue that technology vendors suffer from the same political forces as do data modelers 


-  Although their purpose is often to eliminate redundant data storage ,  they often yield little real business value 


-  They believe ,  consciously or unconsciously ,  that informations value for business decisions is not only very high but also self-evident 


-  They assume that information itself is valueless ,  or at least that its value is the same to all organizational members 


-  If they are conscious of the relationship between information access and hierarchy ,  they assume that those high in the hierarchy would not restrict the free flow of information for any reason other than corporate security 


-  Information anarchy usually emerges when more centralized approaches to information management break down or when no key executive realizes the importance of common information 


-  When everyone has his or her own database ,  the numbers for revenues ,  costs ,  customer order levels ,  and so on will diverge in databases throughout the company 


-  The desire for information that leads to anarchy should quickly be harnessed into  more organized political model 


-  They can also decide what measures are used to understand performance as well as what language ,  by which we mean  common vocabulary ,  is used within the realm 


-  Key measures of the enterprises health often are not collected ,  reported ,  or even considered beyond roll-up of financial outcomes ,  further diminishing the central authoritys power 


-  When divisions have their own strategies ,  products ,  and customers ,  it is almost inevitable that their information needs will differ 


-  The latter executive eventually brought in consultants to give  seminar on the value of common data and systems  all ,  the last we heard ,  to no avail 


-  In one high-technology manufacturing firm ,  for example ,  the quality function head created an executive information system that reported on operational performance and quality data 


-  It is also possible that ,  as in Renaissance times ,  the proliferation of patrons will encourage innovation and creativity within each realm for example ,  the development of  particularly useful quality information system by one division 


-  Power is centralized ,  and departments and divisions have substantially less autonomy regarding information policies 


-  ,  Much depends on the approach the monarch takes to managing the realms information 


-  ,  The rapidly growing specialty manufacturer mentioned above is an example 


-  His appointment of czars to define and implement common information policies reflected his belief in the importance of information management issues 


-  This top-down approach is an example of enlightened monarchy at its best ,  since the action was taken not in response to  specific crisis but as  well-considered response to  broad organizational objective 


-  The CEO is usually considered the primary user of such  system ,  although some attempt is usually made to solicit the information requirements of other executives 


-  However ,  the effort is not always successful 


-  At one insurance company we studied ,  an EIS intended for the entire senior management team was never used seriously by anyone other than the CEO 


-  Other executives were concerned about how their units would fare under close analysis ,  and they kept their own feudal information sources 


-  ,  One drawback to any information monarchy is the simple fact of mortality 


-  In one high-tech manufacturing firm ,  the founder CEOs retirement led to information anarchy for many years; only now is the firm beginning to establish  more structured environment 


-  ,  The final information state ,  federalism ,  also has  number of desirable features ,  and in todays business environment ,  it is the preferred model in most circumstances 


-  Federalism most explicitly recognizes the importance of politics ,  without casting it in pejorative terms 


-  Such an information manager needs to have the CEOs support  ( although not too much support ,  or  monarchy emerges )  as well as the trust and support of the lords and barons who run the divisions 


-  He or she needs to understand the value of information itself as well as of the technology that stores ,  manipulates ,  and distributes it 


-  ,  An executive who has this perspective can then use cooperative information resources to create  shared information vision 


-  This is  genuine leveraging of  firms knowledge base 


-  ,  At IBM ,  the former head of corporate information services ,  Larry Ford ,  concluded that the firm needed to manage information in  dramatically new way 


-  Ford and his organization produced an information strategy that focused on the value that information can bring to all of IBM 


-  ,  We believe that there are only two viable choices among the five models: monarchy and federalism 


-  Most firms we know of profess  desire to move toward  federalist model 


-  ,  Table  summarizes our assessments of the five political models along four dimensions:  (  )  commonality of vocabulary and meaning;  (  )  degree of access to important information;  (  )  quality of information  that is ,  its currency ,  relevance ,  and accuracy; and  (  )  efficiency of information management 


-  The desirability of common discourse may appear obvious ,  but in our experience it does not exist in many large firms 


-  However ,  in making the choices about who actually needs what information ,  firms are making political decisions ,  whether or not they acknowledge it 


-  Information quality is achieved through detailed attention to its integrity ,  accuracy ,  currency ,  interpretability ,  and overall value 


-  As with other types of products ,  the quality of information is best judged by its customers 


-  ,  Efficiency is often the objective of technologists who wish to minimize redundant data storage 


-  The incredible improvements in price-performance ratios for data storage technologies have reduced this issues importance somewhat 


-  However ,  there is still the human factor 


-  Multiple measures of the same item take time to analyze and synthesize 


-  Although satisfying all constituencies may require gathering more information than is absolutely necessary  ( hence decreasing efficiency )  ,  and the necessary compromises may reduce quality ,  federalism scores higher in the minds of the managers we interviewed than any other model 


-  ,  Because federalism explicitly acknowledges the important positive role that information politics can play ,  it is apt to be the most effective model for companies that rely on individual initiative for generating collective action 


-  This is most likely to be the case for companies operating in complex and rapidly changing competitive environments ,  which create  high level of uncertainty 


-  Accomplishing it ,  of course ,  requires negotiating skills and the willingness of managers to take the time to negotiate 


-  Not all companies have executives with the ability or the commitment to do this 


-  In fact ,  as Table  shows ,  many of the firms pursuing federalism were also pursuing other models ,  either consciously or implicitly as  backup strategy 


-  Because technocratic utopians do not concern themselves with the processes that produce information ,  the quality of information remains low 


-  The customer controls information ,  thus its quality is likely to be high  unless the customer is an executive trying to take an organizationwide perspective 


-  Feudalism gets only middling marks for quality; it may be high for individual divisions ,  but it is low from the corporate perspective 


-  Most firms we know of profess  desire to move toward  federalist model ,  while currently operating in  feudal or technocratic utopian environment 


-  ,  It is no accident that democracy emerged in eighteenth-century America ,   sprawling continent with vast resources and an ethic of independence and self-sufficiency 


-  When faxes were flying to and from pre-Tiananmen China ,  some observers argued that the free flow of information was leading to  more open society; now that the faxes and those who faxed are silent ,  we know that the causal relationship was in the other direction 


-  We have never seen increased information flow leading to elimination of  management layer or  greater willingness to share information 


-  When these latter changes happen ,  they happen for reasons unrelated to information: restructurings ,  tighter cost control ,  external events  (  


-  One firm was  fast-growing personal computer  ( PC )  manufacturer when we studied it; since then ,  its growth has slackened 


-  The other firm was  large manufacturer of several types of computers that was experiencing financial problems when we visited it 


-  Their cultures seemed similar at first glance; they both had tried to develop cultures in which information was shared freely throughout their organizations with little regard to level or function 


-  However ,  two key aspects of their cultures  their organizational structures and their relative financial success  had led to radically different information politics 


-  Allowing others access to information requires  lot of trust ,  but that trust seems to exist here 


-  The managers we interviewed speculated that this was because  team that shares its information fully may lose its reason to exist 


-  This is particularly true during the economically difficult times now facing the company 


-  Put more broadly ,  in the information-based organization ,  information becomes the primary medium of value and exchange ,  and who would give it away for free? ,  How do you know when your culture is right for more democratic information politics? There are  number of indicators 


-  We have noticed ,  for example ,  that companies that successfully implement quality programs have to deal with many of the same issues affecting information flow 


-  Similarly ,  companies highly attuned to customer satisfaction must be able to deal with negative results in  positive fashion   trait highly necessary in an information democracy 


-  And geographic differences affecting the willingness to share information are legendary; how many times has it been uttered ,  Were having problems getting data from our French subsidiary 


-  ,  Although technology will not lead us to an information utopia ,  there are still important technological factors to consider 


-  Information engineering should be highly focused ,  information should be in units that managers can understand and negotiate with ,  and technology platforms should be as common as possible 


-  We  ( and other researchers )  ,  believe that focused ,  less ambitious information management objectives are more likely to succeed ,  given that the volume of information in corporations is too great to be rigorously categorized and engineered 


- 14 This is particularly true in  federalist environment ,  in which each key information element will require substantial negotiations 


-  At IBM ,  for example ,  the firms internal information strategy focuses primarily on customer and market information and secondarily on process quality information 


- 15 Although this approach includes  great deal of data ,  it also excludes  considerable amount 


-  ,  It is also important to acknowledge that not all information will be managed through technological means ,  just as most of the water around us does not run through our water meters 


-  Technologists must concern themselves with the data elements that appear on documents ,  but managers will normally be happy not to delve below the document level in developing  common information language 


- 17 ,   key aspect of making information more widely available ,  ineffective technocratic utopias to the contrary ,  is the nature of the information technology platform 


-  This may seem obvious ,  but few companies can send  piece of data to all their workstations without considerable machinations to address different products ,  protocols ,  and other technical particulars 


-  At companies such as IBM ,  Xerox ,  Kodak ,  and Merrill Lynch ,  recent CIOs have been fast-track executives with records of managing important non-technology aspects of the business 


-  If these nontechnical managers can master the considerable technical challenges in creating an information infrastructure ,  they will likely have the skills and influence to bring about  political environment in which the information can be shared and used 


-  In order to take on broader responsibility for information management ,  they must at  minimum convince operational executives of their ability to understand and manage operational performance information 


-  We have found  few CFOs with the sincere desire to do this but have seen no examples of  CFO becoming  successful information politician 


-  ,  The CEO is perhaps best positioned to lobby for  particular information environment; indeed ,  in an information monarchy ,  the CEO is the only politician who counts 


-  In more democratic environments ,  such as federalism ,  the CEO must appreciate the importance of information and communicate it throughout the firm 


-  They must be able to persuade both individuals and the masses of the importance of information management and the correctness of the chosen political model 


-  They must also organize collections of advance agents and ward heelers to work every day at building coalitions ,  influencing opinion leaders ,  and swaying recalcitrant members of the electorate 


-  ,  Because information is such  powerful tool ,  federalist organizations will inherently resist or distrust managers who try to build an empire by controlling information 


-  Concentration of all responsibility for collecting ,  maintaining ,  and interpreting information in one person ,  regardless of position ,  is too much power in any organization with democratic leanings 


-  In fact ,  the concept of information ownership is antithetical to federalist information management 


-  ,  The IS organization should be particularly careful to avoid building an information empire 


-  It may already wield considerable power by virtue of its technical custody of information 


-  When the CEO himself was denied  report ,  the IS head was deposed and replaced by  trusted nontechnical associate of the CEO 


-  Yet because he could not understand the technology ,  he could not dismantle the walls around the data 


-  They must view information as important to their success and be willing to spend time and energy negotiating to meet their information needs
