- Internal financial considerations and external market considerations are ,  at most companies ,  antagonistic forces in pricing decisions 


-  Financial people allocate costs to determine how high prices must be to cover costs and achieve their profit objectives 


-  Marketing and salespeople analyze buyers to determine how low prices must be to achieve their sales objectives 


-  From traditional cost accounting ,  they learn to take sales objectives as given before allocating costs ,  thus precluding the ability to incorporate market forces into pricing decisions 


-  Perhaps ,  along the way ,  these managers study economics and learn that ,  in theory ,  optimal pricing is  blending of cost and demand considerations 


-  The result is tactical pricing focused on short-term objectives 


-  No company can have  real pricing strategy ,   plan to maximize long-term profitability ,  until management has learned how to balance these opposing forces strategically 


-  ,  As representatives of their respective stakeholders ,  the finance-accounting and marketing-sales functions have legitimate concerns with regard to pricing policy 


-  The problem is that these concerns are often addressed in functional isolation ,  and they are decided by whichever functional group wields the most political control 


-  First ,  we discuss the objectives and philosophies of both cost-driven and customer-driven pricing 


-  ,  In cost-driven pricing ,  primary responsibility for the pricing decision rests with the finance and accounting functions  ( see Table  )  


-  They often oversee the financial evaluation of multiple products and services ,  and their objective is to reduce performance evaluation for all products and services to  common measure:  reasonable return over the products full cost 


-  Once variable costs are covered ,  according to this philosophy ,  pricing should be driven totally by what is necessary to close  sale or achieve  sales objective 


-  The fundamental focus of the pricing decision is on current sales levels relative to sales objectives 


-  Consequently ,  one cannot maximize total profits by making every sale that might be individually profitable 


-  Moreover ,   customers willingness to pay is often  poor guide to pricing even when prices can be individually negotiated 


-  Often willingness to pay falls short of economic value because the customer doubts  products promised performance or is uncertain of its benefits 


-  The salespersons and product managers job is to overcome these problems ,  raising customers willingness to pay to reflect  products value 


-  He agrees that the market is tougher than originally predicted ,  but he argues convincingly that if he cant meet the sales objective at the current price ,  how can he possibly meet it at  higher price? The difficult market ,  he argues ,  calls for discounting current prices ,  not increasing them 


-  She dispenses with the tactical ,  inconsistent ,  counterproductive questions that initially motivated the meeting: What price do we need to cover our unit costs? What price do we need to meet our sales objective? Instead she focuses the discussion on  more general question: What changes in price ,  and in the marketing program ,  could make this product more profitable? First ,  she makes it clear to the sales manager that failing to reach sales goals is not by itself  justification for cutting price 


-  You have talked to the customers ,  and you understand how competitors will react 


-   will trust your judgment on this issue 


-  If you decide to discount the price by 10 percent ,  she pauses to look at her calculation ,  your sales must rise by at least 25 percent to make the price change  profitable one 


-  Consequently ,  the sales objective ,  by which your division will be evaluated and compensated ,  must rise by that amount 


-  If it is easier to reach  25 percent higher sales objective at lower prices than to reach your current objective at current prices ,  you should discount the price 


-  ,  In contrast to cost-based pricing ,  where the finance people can avoid responsibility for effects on sales volume ,  and customer-driven pricing ,  where the salespeople can avoid responsibility for profitability ,  this approach forces the decision maker to confront the tradeoffs 


-  In particular ,  he is concerned that there may not be enough additional demand generated by  10 percent price cut to reach  higher sales objective 


-  Would  higher price justify lowering the sales objective? he asks 


-  The general manager again does  brief calculation and reports that ,  if prices could be increased by 10 percent ,  she could cut the sales objective by 17 percent and still achieve current levels of profitability 


-  The sales objective will be reduced 17 percent 


-  The sales manager is satisfied ,  since he has what he thinks is  more achievable sales objective 


-  The finance manager is satisfied because ,  to the extent that the sales manager succeeds ,  his profitability objective will also be achieved 


-  The focus on overall profitability avoids the distortions that result from tactical pricing to achieve functional objectives 


-  These measures simplify and clarify the analysis of  price change by including only those variables that will be affected by the price change  ( price ,  variable costs ,  incremental fixed costs ,  and sales volume )  and excluding variables that are irrelevant to the price change  ( administrative overhead and other sunk or fixed costs )  


-  Customer and competitive assessments consider the impact of external market forces 


-  In the past two decades ,  marketing theorists and practitioners have made enormous strides in incorporating the external considerations into marketing strategy 


-  But the appropriate role of financial analysis in marketing has been less well explained and understood 


-  Qualitative and subjective market information then must be considered to assess the likelihood that customer and competitor response will enable the firm to achieve the breakeven sales level and to ensure that the price change is consonant with managerial strategy 


-  Whether that contribution vastly exceeds what is necessary to achieve our profit objective or falls dismally short is not  pricing issue 


-  It indicates the importance of sales volume as  marketing objective 


-  ,   cost structure analysis provides  general sense of the firms financial sensitivity 


-  After reviewing these needs ,  the general manager gives him the result of one more calculation: the added sales required to pay for these additional marketing resources 


-  This surprises the sales manager ,  for whom marketing resources were always charged simply as part of administrative overhead burden 


-  She points out to him ,  however ,  that spending money on these resources can only be justified if they generate  sufficient addition to sales ,  in excess of what otherwise would be needed 


-  ,  They agree that he will need an additional $500 , 000 for increased sales support 


-  The general manager calculates that ,  at the new contribution margin of $35 ,  he will need to sell at least 14 , 286 units more ,  about  


-  ,  While back-of-the-envelope formulas are handy for quick price change-profitability calculations ,  most managers have access to personal computers and spreadsheets that significantly enhance their ability to assess the impact of  pending price change 


-  Clearly it no longer makes sense to raise price ,  notes the sales manager 


-  In fact ,  the word Im getting from the field reps is that ,  if we want to be competitive ,  we had better think about cutting price to match the competition 


-  Otherwise ,  we will continue to fall short of our sales objectives 


-  However ,  what if the company wants to consider  range of potential price changes? How can breakeven sales analysis be applied to consider more than just one price change at  time? The answer is by charting  constant profit curve ,  which summarizes the results of  series of breakeven sales analyses on different prices 


-  The calculations are particularly interesting when plotted ,  since they define  boundary of market response required for  price change to break even  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  The constant profit curve is  simple yet powerful way to synthesize and evaluate the dynamics behind the profitability of potential price changes 


-  Moreover ,  good managers are accustomed to making judgments under uncertainty 


-  Instead of demanding  precise estimate of actual demand elasticity and proceeding to set the optimal price ,  we begin with the price changes that managers might choose to make for strategic reasons  (  


-  Fortunately ,  by reversing the economic approach to pricing ,  we can replace the need to forecast demand accurately with the less onerous requirement that we merely test the hypothesis that the demand curves elasticity is greater or less than the required level ,  as illustrated in the constant profit curve 


-  The fact that  pricing decision might not achieve its breakeven sales level in the short term is not by itself  reason to reject it 


-  )  ,  How many incremental sales over the long term are necessary to justify this short-term promotion? The answer is at least 24 percent 


-  Which customer segments will be more sensitive to the price change? How will customer expectations be influenced by the price change? Will they perceive an emerging price trend or simply an opportunity for  short-term sale? Will new market segments emerge as  result of the new price? If so ,  are the costs of serving these new customers different ,  and how should these costs be integrated into an assessment of financial sensitivity  (  


-  ,  as an incremental fixed cost or  change in variable cost )  ,  Sources of information include the following: ,  Managers considering  price change need competitor intelligence to predict how and how quickly competitors will match the price change 


-  Which competitors will more likely respond? Are they financially able to sustain  significant threat to the proposed price policy? What market signals have they given regarding their marketing and pricing strategies? Will they interpret our price change as  signal to defend current customers ,  as an opportunistic threat ,  or as  longer-term strategic shift in positioning? Will new competitors be encouraged to enter as  result of the new price policy? If so ,  how will the dynamics of industry competition be affected?5 Which segments are they likely to target? Which segments do we want to protect and defend ,  and which are we willing to cede? We propose four categories of competitor information to address these questions 


-  Does the price change lead to market opportunities that are consistent with the firms core competencies and with the business units goals and objectives? What are the ripple effects of  change in price policy on other dimensions of corporate strategy? ,  For instance ,   firm may decide to cut price to protect its market base from aggressive competitors 


-  To communicate the price cut ,  it decides on  significant short-term increase in advertising 


-  ,  Strategic pricing should involve not only what is evaluated but how it is evaluated 


-  The managerial process is as important as the information it evaluates 


-  Yet no single function has all the information needed to make  balanced evaluation of  pricing decision 


-  Profit-driven pricing thus gathers all of the information bearing on the price change ,  quantitatively frames it in  way that highlights the tradeoffs involved in  pricing decision ,  and evaluates the information in  managerial forum that collectively weighs alternative scenarios and strives for  consensus about the most prudent pricing policy to achieve  common objective
