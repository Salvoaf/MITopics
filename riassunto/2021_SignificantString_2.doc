- After corporations committed to dramatically increasing their focus on racial equity in response to the killing of George Floyd in May 2020 ,  the hard work of making the changes needed to live up to those promises began 


-  Unsurprisingly ,  those changes are meeting resistance ,  such as negative comments posted during virtual forums about race and  lawsuit filed by  White employee claiming that diversity training created  hostile work environment 


-  And if anything threatens to thwart Americas progress toward open dialogue and racial equity ,  it is White peoples unwillingness to engage with the idea that if others are suffering from undeserved disadvantages ,  it is all but certain that they themselves benefit from undeserved advantages 


-  ,  This critical understanding of systemic racism  that all of us ,  whether we want to or not ,  are participants within  system in which our racial membership has implications for important life outcomes  is antithetical to peoples desire or need to see themselves as decent ,  good ,  meritorious individuals 


-  Our research shows that ,  because systemic racism suggests that White employees have benefited from  personal characteristic over which they have no control ,  systemic racism is difficult for many of them to acknowledge 


-  As  result ,  calling out systemic racism provokes defensive behaviors that undermine efforts promoting change and make them more difficult and divisive 


-  ,  Nevertheless ,  corporate leaders who genuinely support social change must see racism as systemic:  structural component that impacts every aspect of organizational life ,  from marketing to pricing ,  from supply chains to talent acquisition 


-  And in order to make real progress toward racial equity within their organizations ,  leaders must also recognize that racial equity initiatives  just like all significant organizational changes ,  but with even greater emotional intensity  will face opposition and resistance 


-  ,  The key to effectively responding to resistance is leveraging that human need to think of ourselves as good ,  because its accompanied by our need to think of our systems as fair and just  and this desire to restore justice is powerful 


-  As researchers ,  our work indicates that if White individuals can both come to believe that systemic racial inequity exists and also see  role for themselves in the dismantling of racist systems ,  they will choose to do so  even if it is at  cost to the self or group ,  such as supporting policies that remove White advantages 


-  ,  Just as some readers may feel uncomfortable with the ideas in this article ,  so too will many of your employees 


-  These reactions fall into predictable patterns ,  which we and others have spent over 20 years documenting and we discuss below 


-  Understanding the why behind  response provides insights into ways to counter the reflexive defensiveness that the notion of systemic racism elicits from many people 


-  ,  To recognize the reality of systemic racism ,  White people must first recognize themselves as having  racial identity that affects the environments that they find themselves in ,  how others engage with them ,  and how they see themselves 


-  Denial is one of the most common forms of White backlash: White people simply deny that racism is  significant problem 


-  However ,  such opposition can manifest in surprising and subtle ways ,  which can make denial harder to counteract 


-  But where racial inequality already exists ,  its impossible to make  or measure  progress in redressing inequality without talking about race or tracking racialized outcomes 


-  In addition ,  White people who are opposed to racial equity are more likely to endorse colorblindness ,  or the idea that race does not matter and should not be acknowledged 


-  Multiculturalism ,  on the other hand ,  which is typically favored by employees of color ,  takes the view that differences should be acknowledged and celebrated 


-  As  result ,  even when they acknowledge that employees of color are disadvantaged ,  they still distance themselves from this problem by distancing themselves psychologically from the White racial identity 


-   similar strategy is to point to personal hardships  ( Ive struggled with addiction or Im  child of divorce )  as evidence that the individual has not personally benefited from racial advantages 


-  Yet ,  pointing to hardship or claiming that one deserves what one has due to hard work overlooks the reality that many non-White individuals have worked just as hard but without commensurate outcomes  and does not change the value that having White skin provides in society at this moment 


-   growing category of backlash tactics fall under what we call distortion ,  or strategies wherein White people recognize the existence of racism but distort the nature of racial inequity to protect their own good feelings 


-  Seeing racism as largely an issue of individual behavior is also problematic because it focuses efforts on remedies that do not address the systemic nature of racism 


- 13 These findings align with observations from our consulting work ,  where we often hear from clients that they struggle with employees who believe that changes in hiring and promotion processes that are designed to remedy systemic racism will work against them 


-  ,  While the research we describe above demonstrates how White people often respond defensively to racial equity efforts ,  we have also identified when and why they sometimes cope with their discomfort by choosing  fourth responsive strategy that is more productive: embracing the urge to dismantle unjust systems 


-  So how can we bring employees to this point? Here ,  we provide three positive actions designed to counter the three defensive responses and increase the likelihood of the more productive response 


-  One promising trend we have observed is that more and more organizations are disclosing demographic data regarding recruitment ,  hiring ,  promotion ,  leadership ,  and retention 


-  Public disclosure of data works in direct opposition to the denial strategy by providing evidence of racial disparities 


-  Such disclosures also directly counter the distortion strategy by making plain who is advantaged and who is disadvantaged and by which practices  ( including those that may seem good ,  such as recruiting primarily from elite universities )  


-  For example ,  Nasdaq has proposed requiring companies to report on board diversity in order to be listed on the exchange 


-  In the United Kingdom ,  large companies must provide nonfinancial information regarding their activities relating to employee and board diversity 


-  population )  ,  but 75% of them are employed at lower-level jobs ,  this would meet the standard of diversity of racial representation ,  but not  standard of racial equity 


-  This is why Coca-Cola has focused on the demographics of its leadership team; even though it has managed to increase the demographic diversity of its new hires ,  the executive team does not mirror the demographics of its largest markets 


-  And even data on ,  say ,  the executive team is not necessarily helpful in aggregate: Studies on gender diversity on boards have found that even though there are increasing numbers of women on boards ,  they are often relegated to roles with relatively little influence 


- 14 Organizations must push themselves to collect and understand better and more meaningful data in order to accurately track their progress 


-  One of the ways in which distancing harms racial equity is by allowing White people to think that efforts toward racial equity need not involve them 


-  But building  shared understanding of inequity as  characteristic of systems in which all people ,  regardless of race ,  are enmeshed entails inviting White people to participate in more active ways than the ubiquitous courageous conversation or listening tour 


-   notable exception came from one leader ,  who acknowledged in  letter the anguish and trauma that many members of the organizational community were feeling but also urged all stakeholders ,  especially the majority ,  who are White ,  to consider how to actively engage with racism 


-  This second component is noteworthy; by explicitly calling on White Americans to participate in this endeavor ,  this leader made it clear that White people have  seat at the table and an obligation to be part of the solution 


-  And ,  in fact ,  research shows that explicitly inviting majority-group members to act on equity increases their support for and engagement with equity initiatives 


- 15 ,  The lack of explicit expectations for White peoples participation in many equity efforts historically may be why most initiatives die on the vine once they move past the C-suite 


- 16 Here ,  we would suggest leaders not only encourage White employees to participate but also highlight those who do 


-  We advise this not to diminish the value of the work that BIPOC pioneers are doing to push these efforts forward but because people are more likely to change their minds  and their behavior  when they see that others similar to themselves hold particular attitudes and beliefs 


-  In this way ,  inviting broad participation and highlighting how specific behaviors are consistent with the core value of equity will reinforce their importance in the pantheon of organizational values 


-  ,  Collaboration also requires that leaders engage seriously with White employees fears of being penalized while they are still in the phase of learning 


-  For this reason ,  we stress the importance of creating spaces where White employees can practice talking about racism 


-  In this way ,  fears that inhibit White employees from talking about racism  and that inhibit learning  can be mitigated 


-  Small group workshops are ideal for this purpose ,  as long as they are led by  skilled facilitator who sets the expectation that mistakes are likely and ensures that immediate constructive feedback is provided 


-  The idea here is not to give people the opportunity to say offensive things; the expectation is that they can test ways of talking about race and change their behavior as they receive feedback 


-  ,  Another way to manage these fears is to have well-defined rules and procedures to address offensive behaviors when they inevitably occur and to communicate these policies unambiguously 


-   combination of safe learning spaces for White employees and clear guidelines regarding shared expectations for behavior can help to reassure all employees that learning is valued and that violations are treated both fairly and seriously 


-  Distortion tactics can be especially difficult to counter because they essentially try to change the terms of the discussion and alter its goals 


-  Countering this tactic requires that leaders be especially clear when setting the vision and specifying the goal of racial equity 


-  ,   good deal of the literature aimed at managers makes the business case for diversity ,  no doubt reflecting in part the long-held  but now much-disputed  assumption that business leaders primary allegiance is to shareholders and that any initiative they undertake must contribute to the bottom line 


- 17 But using improved organizational performance as the rationale for equity efforts can support an argument against diversity if it does not produce the anticipated gains 


-  For example ,  recent research shows that when people who believe in the business case for diversity are on  diverse team that underperforms ,  they have more negative attitudes toward members of other social groups 


- 19 In addition ,  research finds that  focus on the business case for diversity can actually undermine BIPOC employees by marking them as merely useful tokens 


- 20 Thus ,  only highlighting the business case for diversity has some critical and potentially negative consequences 


-  ,  We urge organizational leaders to instead base their case on widely held moral values of fairness and equity ,  with justice as their goal 


-  Framing their vision in these terms allows leaders to acknowledge the reality that diversity ,  equity ,  and inclusion  ( DEI )  efforts require companies to prioritize long-term equity and organizational justice over the psychological discomfort of some employees and the possibility of short-term losses 


-  Our research shows that openly recognizing this discomfort ahead of time can reduce White backlash ,  making White employees less likely to distance themselves and more likely to accept the reality of systemic racism 


-  And we have found that when their hard work is acknowledged ,  White employees can become less prone to backlash and more likely to recognize racial privilege 


- 21 ,  Establishing justice and equity as the basis for DEI efforts also enables leaders to communicate the psychological benefit that comes from working in  truly meritocratic environment 


-  He stressed that the changes were meant to improve meritocracy at the company 


- 22 In this way ,  Coca-Colas leaders acknowledged the discomfort that White employees had with the changes 


-  At the same time ,  it emphasized that the efforts would not only benefit minority employees ,  who could gain confidence that their good performance would not be overlooked due to their race; the efforts would also have benefits for White employees ,  who could gain confidence that their career gains were the result of their hard work rather than their race 


-  ,  It may be that not everyone in your organization is moved by the techniques for overcoming resistance to equity initiatives that weve described 


-  Ultimately ,  if backlash cannot be overcome ,  it must be removed  or else it risks establishing backlash as tacitly acceptable 


-  Employees  both White and BIPOC  evaluate how committed organizations are to change initiatives by watching how leadership responds to opposition and resistance 


-  For this reason ,  leaders must not only be explicit about what they will and will not tolerate but also act upon those statements 


-  For example ,  following inappropriate behavior by employees during an all-hands meeting ,  Cisco announced  $5 million donation to anti-racism groups ,  stated that the company will not tolerate racism ,  and fired several employees because of their conduct 


- 23 ,  But regardless of where the line is drawn ,  the important point is that there is one: Employees make sense of their organizational culture by observing who and what is rewarded and what is penalized 


-  While  lack of training or knowledge explains some opposition ,  leaders need to treat employees resistance to institutional changes designed to address systemic racism with the same determination with which they treat any opposition to  strategic organizational change: Identify and educate those who need more guidance and can be persuaded ,  and let go those who are unwilling to participate in the vision 


-  ,  Leaders committed to making the changes necessary to advance meaningfully toward racial equity in their organizations must be prepared for some degree of internal opposition ,  most likely from White employees ,  who may variously feel discomfort ,  guilt ,  and/or threats to the existing system and their sense of self 


-  As we have seen ,  these reactions are predictable and can be addressed systemically and intentionally  if not necessarily easily  just as with opposition to any other major strategic change that leaders spearhead 


-  ,  Among the many challenges embedded in organizational changes related to racial equity is that corporate leaders must speak to two internal constituent groups: BIPOC employees and their allies ,  and White employees who do not believe in the existence of structural racism 


-  To effectively communicate the urgency of the need for change ,  leaders need to acknowledge the deep harm that systemic racism has wrought on communities and employees of color ,  and connect their efforts at repairing this damage to deeply held social values and corporate purpose 


-  Yet they must do this while simultaneously balancing those statements of solidarity with the possibility that such statements will put their non-ally White employees on the defensive and elicit the opposition that we described above 


-  Our hope is that being prepared for this opposition will let organizational leaders preempt the many backlash tactics that have been and will be made against racial equity work 


-  And by successfully countering such backlash ,  leaders and organizations will be better positioned to do the hard work of transformational change needed to dismantle current systems of racism and achieve racial equity
