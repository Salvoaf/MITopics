- When you think of workplace courage ,  your mind might go straight to whistleblowing  calling out unethical behavior ,  often in the senior ranks of an organization 


-  Challenging bosses about strategic moves or operating policies ,  speaking honestly to peers or subordinates who arent pulling their weight ,  making and owning bold decisions  these ,  too ,  are acts of workplace courage 


-   companys learning cycle is strengthened and optimized when people give honest feedback to those in charge 


-  In our research ,  we found  consistently negative correlation between how courageous people think  particular behavior is and how frequently it happens 


-  Thats not surprising overall ,  since  persons perceived need for courage implies that they fear taking  risk  an obvious deterrent to action 


-  It didnt seem to matter whether respondents worked for  type of company that one might assume promotes exploration and learning  for instance ,   young tech company ,   small startup ,  or  business with  relatively flat organizational structure  or whether they were younger ,  more educated ,  or in higher-status roles 


-  ,  Compounding these problems ,  in many of the organizations we studied ,  leaders didnt seem to fully appreciate the types or levels of risk that their employees associated with these behaviors ,  and so they felt little pressure to change the status quo 


-  ,  In this article ,  we hope to help leaders more clearly see both the benefits and the risks associated with the behaviors we identified and to become more invested in cultivating them 


-  ,  Courage is  foundational virtue because people often need it in order to display other virtues 


-  After answering some basic questions about how well things were going in their organization ,  they were asked to think of the environment directly around them at work and rate on  seven-point scale how courageous each of the 35 behaviors would be 


-  That involves considering what we call the targets of action  those who are primarily affected by the behaviors  when people speak truth to others and when they challenge their own sense of self 


-  ,  Sometimes improving an organizations functioning requires willingness to challenge skip-level leaders  those two or more levels above the actor 


-  John ,   shift supervisor in  pharmaceutical manufacturing plant ,  sang the praises of his boss ,  who stuck his neck out for us to secure the space and resources his team needed to do their work effectively 


-  When  colleague showed up unprepared for the detailed discussion that needed to happen and said hed have to share his views sometime the next week ,  Randy had had enough of this common occurrence 


-  He frankly told the colleague that he didnt appreciate his showing up to meetings late and unprepared ,  that it was  sign that this person didnt respect everyones time ,  and that the middle of the following week would delay the project too much 


-  ,  Since the behaviors weve described so far are likely to be met with some resistance  from above ,  from peers ,  or from external stakeholders  it stands to reason that people see them as risky and thus dont do them nearly enough ,  despite their potential value 


-  But even when the target of action is  subordinate ,  holding that person accountable for undesirable choices and actions  ( rightfully considered simply doing ones job as  manager )  is rare because of the courage it requires 


-  This makes sense ,  because unchecked bad behavior  whatever its cause  undermines others beliefs that people will be treated fairly ,  that merit matters ,  and that its worth working harder or being committed to  team effort 


- 10 ,  Challenging ones sense of self 


-  While many courageous behaviors are risky because they can alienate people with economic ,  organizational ,  or social power ,  others largely involve stretching or challenging ones sense of self 


-  You might ,  for example ,  let your employees see how something deeply upsetting has affected you 


-  But as long as youre sincere and also able to keep moving forward productively  as David ,   site manager ,  did after  safety incident led to an employee death in his mining organization  catching this glimpse of your humanity wont make people think youre weak 


-  When the company does need to hire ,  it benefits from being  standout employer of choice in the area 


-  ,  As weve noted ,  lots of people in lots of places avoid lots of opportunities to engage in what we might hope would be routine growth behaviors 


-  These behaviors are difficult for everyone   middle manager in the tech industry ,   C-suite executive in  consulting firm ,   production worker at  manufacturing company  and they happen so rarely that there are measurable negative effects on individual and collective well-being 


-  This makes sense ,  though ,  given that vertical power structures may inhibit behaviors through threats to career or economic well-being  ( such as lack of promotion )  ,  whereas flatter settings  where people are more likely to know one another better and have more of  family feeling  may create greater fear of social fallout 


- 11 But we do think they fail to understand the inhibitive power of socialization ,  growing obligations to others ,  and golden handcuffs if their strategy for being courageous at work is mostly Ill do it later 


-  If youre  leader  someone who wants to inspire and influence others rather than merely boss them  you cant just ask them to display more courage 


-  They might ,  for example ,  understand that employees are worried about career consequences and therefore focus on convincing them that they wont be penalized if they challenge authority 


-  Leaders who dont fully appreciate this reality will have  hard time promoting the honesty they want among peers or between managers and subordinates 


-  ,  Leaders who want to encourage growth-oriented behaviors also have to more fully appreciate that standing out poses psychological risks 


- 13 No one wants to feel stupid ,  incompetent ,  or impotent 


-  Were our own harshest critics ,  and when were really pushing boundaries ,  theres  real chance well take at least  temporary hit to how we feel about ourselves 


-  Armed with  better understanding of whats holding people back ,  your next step is to make real changes 


-  ,  In our research ,  weve seen the following pattern play out in many organizations: ,  When youre trying to solve  problem as challenging as this one  were talking about helping people develop the motivation and skills to overcome deep-seated fears and rational calculations of self-interest   perfunctory approach simply wont get it done 


-  How do you do that as  leader? You start by modeling and supporting the behavior you want to see 


-  An entrepreneur might have  ladder that goes from Have an honest conversation with my cofounder about the interpersonal tension thats building between us to Refuse much-needed funding from an investor who  know doesnt share my values 


-  Spend time getting honest feedback about the important behaviors that your people are currently too afraid to routinely do but that they know are critical to individuals and the organizations growth and well-being 


-  Then lead  process where you collectively agree on the behaviors youll put on your group or organizational ladder ,  and in what order 


-  If youre not sure you already have the level of trust needed for this exercise ,  engage someone else to lead the process 


-  Tell everyone in your unit or organization what actions youll be supporting ,  assessing ,  and rewarding 


-  Public statements dont just inspire or motivate others; they also compel us to act ,  because now were at risk of embarrassment should we not proceed 


-  We suggest starting with the least daunting behavior for two reasons 


-  First ,  when people think about tackling the toughest action on their list ,  theyre way more likely to just not do it 


-  Remember ,  its at the top for  reason ,  whether you dont yet have the skills to pull it off or youre just not psychologically ready 


-  Second ,  starting with  more manageable act increases the odds that it will go reasonably well and thus increases your motivation to keep learning and keep climbing 


-  The last thing you want to do is fall off the ladder by moving to the top too quickly ,  thereby cementing your fear that courageous action is just  synonym for stupid choice 


-  No one wants to look foolish ,  be disliked ,  or get negatively labeled for rocking the boat 


-  And managers ,  if theyre honest ,  dont like being the boat thats getting rocked or being told that it has  leak 


-  But nor do any of us want to look back at our work and our careers with such regret over what we left undone that it outweighs much of the good weve done 


-  ,  Standing up and speaking out matters  for ourselves ,  our teams ,  and our organizations
