- You are on  crowded elevator standing next to  couple of executives from  company with offices on the floor just above yours 


-  They are talking in low tones about  surprise announcement coming the next day 


-  Their firm ,  AGA Software ,  is being sold to  big ,  famous technology company! My options are going to be worth millions! you hear one of them whisper to the other 


-  Assuming AGA is  publicly traded stock ,  can you run home and buy AGA shares without breaking the law? Knowing when you can legally trade on inside information and when you cannot is tricky 


-  This article will help you better understand the legal minefield 


-  Securities and Exchange Commission for civil cases and the  


-  Department of Justice for criminal cases )  must prove several specific elements to convict someone for trading on or tipping confidential corporate information 


-  Second ,  the trade must have been prompted by the possession of material ,  nonpublic information 


-  Third ,  the defendant ,  whether  trader or tipper ,  must know that the information he or she is dealing with is hot property 


-  Finally ,  insiders must be breaching  fiduciary duty owed to their corporation when they trade on or tip confidential corporate information 


-  This stipulation almost always means that an insider cannot trade on such information and cannot tip others about it if the insider stands to gain by doing so 


-  ,  Lets do  quick legal analysis of our elevator case 


-  First ,  if you buy the AGA shares ,  there clearly will be  purchase of securities 


-  It would be different if you had been planning to sell AGA shares you already owned but decided not to after overhearing the conversation 


-  The law does not penalize  failure to buy or  decision to hold 


-  ,  Second ,  was the information you overheard both nonpublic and material? Yes 


-  The executives were speaking in low tones on the elevator about an announcement to be made tomorrow 


-  And the authorities can prove materiality if  reasonable investor would consider the information important in  decision to buy or sell 


-  The average investor would certainly consider the acquisition announcement important 


-  ,  Third ,  did you know that the information is hot? It seems so 


-  The executives low tones led you to understand that this was  highly confidential matter 


-  ,  Finally ,  does the executives loose talk ,  followed by your trading ,  involve  breach of fiduciary duty? You are not an employee of AGA ,  so you do not have any of the duties to it that an employee would 


-  Finally ,  you are not  family member of any such person 


-  ,  But what about the AGA executives? They have duties to AGA ,  but they are not tipping this hot information to you as part of  trading ring in which you and they will share the spoils 


-  They gain nothing from their carelessness 


-  Is it self-interested? No 


-  ,  So you are free to trade 


-  Of course ,  your actions may spark the interest of securities regulators who monitor unusual trading activity before announcements like this 


-  ,  Now lets change just one fact 


-  Imagine you know one of the AGA executives ,  and this person deliberately whispers the secret information to you on that elevator ride 


-  Over the past few years you and your friend have periodically sent business to and done favors for each other ,  but neither of you has ever given the other  stock tip 


-  Can you trade now? ,  On the surface ,  things still look relatively innocent 


-  Your friend appears to be making you  gift of this information in the hopes that you  but not he  will profit from it 


-  Like the strangers on the elevator ,  he is  blabbermouth ,  but although he has violated his duty to keep company secrets ,  he does not stand to profit from your trade 


-  Is his tip really  pure gift? Or is it part of an ongoing ,  mutually advantageous business or personal relationship? If  tip is part of  flow of favors running between parties ,  the authorities have all they need to make an insider-trading case stick 


-  Your friend clearly violated his duty by revealing company secrets ,  and he stands to gain personally from the eventual quid pro quo you will throw him  whether in the form of  reciprocal tip ,   business referral or help getting his kid into college 


-  In other words ,  his breach of duty was accompanied by the prospect of personal gain 


-  Your informants self-interest makes all the difference 


-  Suppose your friend is an editor for Business Week 


-  His inside information is that Business Week will be ranking innovative software firms in its next issue ,  and placing AGA first in its category 


-  The news is sure to drive the price of AGA stock up sharply 


-  Can you buy AGA shares based on that tip? ,  No 


-  The law treats all secret information that might affect  stocks price the same way ,  whether that information is good or bad and whether it originates from the firm itself ,   business publication or  Wall Street research department 


-  Business reporters ,  securities analysts ,  Wall Street printers ,  investment bankers and many other professionals have been snared when they traded on or tipped others about privileged information belonging to their employers 


-  ,  Rounding out  working knowledge of insider-trading law are three special situations 


-  First ,  confidential information related to  proposed tender offer  such as  hostile takeover  is too hot to handle no matter how innocently it comes to you 


-  The law treats information about tender offers very strictly 


-  The second concerns stock owned through employee stock-purchase plans ,  etc 


-  As an employee ,  you are sure to know some confidential inside information ,  so how can you legally sell your stock? Under  new rule ,  securities regulators have created  safe harbor for employees 


-  Employees who file selling plans with the SEC can sell their stock regularly on  set date  ( such as the first Monday of every month for one year )  


-  This avoids any risk of insider-trading liability 


-  This is  formal technical procedure ,  so ask your companys lawyers for advice 


-  ,  The third situation applies to corporate officers ,  directors and those owning 10% or more of the shares of  firm 


-  In those cases ,   special ,  additional rule requires  six-month wait between any purchase and subsequent sale or sale and subsequent purchase 


-  If you sell shares on Jan 


-   ,  you must wait until June 30 to buy  and vice versa 


-  The rule applies whether or not you know any company secrets 


-  ,  Making money on the basis of inside information can get you into big trouble ,  but there are times when it is legal 


-  So if you find yourself sitting next to  highly placed but loose-lipped stranger in  bar who wants to make you  gift of inside information ,  take it if you want 


-  But dont start buying your new friend drinks every happy hour 


-  This payback is what transforms  random tip or overheard conversation into an illegal insider-trading ring 


-  If you have any doubts about what to do ,  consult  legal expert or ,  even better ,  just dont trade 


-  Life is too short to spend even  small part of it with federal investigators
