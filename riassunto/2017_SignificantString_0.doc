- Innovation is  perennial management challenge 


-  Thats why ,  for decades ,  MIT Sloan Management Review has been publishing new research and insights about innovation  from top researchers at business schools as well as from leading business executives and consultants 


-  ,  For this article ,  we tapped into that knowledge base 


-  We combed through our archives ,  looking for older articles with innovation insights that todays MIT SMR readers might have missed but that still retain wide relevance 


-  We then winnowed down our list of articles and set out to distill 12 key innovation insights from the MIT SMR archives into  succinct format 


-  ,  We present those selections here ,  in capsule form ,  so you can browse through them easily 


-  But you can also dive deep into any of these articles; weve assembled all the articles mentioned at https://sloanreview

-  ,  Innovation isnt just about developing new products or technologies 


-  In  2006 MIT SMR article The 12 Different Ways for Companies to Innovate ,  Mohanbir Sawhney ,  Robert  


-  Wolcott ,  and Inigo Arroniz encouraged executives to think broadly about what types of innovation are possible 


-  The authors noted that companies within the same industry tend to innovate along the same dimensions  whether those dimensions are research and development  ( R&D )  ,  process innovations ,  or branding 


-  Viewing innovation too narrowly ,  the authors pointed out ,  blinds companies to opportunities and leaves them vulnerable to competitors with broader perspectives 


-  Sawhney ,  Wolcott ,  and Arroniz used examples such as Starbucks ,  which initially innovated not by producing  different product but instead by creating  different kind of customer experience  what the company termed  third place for gathering that was between home and work 


-  ,  Business innovation ,  the authors stressed ,  has to do with new value ,  not necessarily new things  and comes in many flavors 


-  When  company identifies and pursues neglected innovation dimensions ,  it can change the basis of competition and leave other firms at  distinct disadvantage ,  the authors concluded 


-  ,  Technological disruption is one way to upend  market ,  but it isnt the only way 


-  For some companies ,  the secret ,  according to Constantinos Markides of London Business School ,  is to change the rules of the game 


-  ,  In researching his 1997 article Strategic Innovation ,  Markides studied more than 30 companies that had successfully attacked leaders in their industry without the benefit of  breakthrough technological innovation 


-  The common element in such successes ,  Markides found ,  was that the attacker changed the rules of the game ,   phenomenon he termed strategic innovation 


-  For example ,  Southwest Airlines changed the rules of the airline industry when it chose to fly its planes point-to-point rather than through hub cities 


-  Strategic innovation occurs ,  Markides wrote ,  when  company identifies gaps in the industry positioning map ,  decides to fill them ,  and the gaps grow to become the new mass market 


-  ,  Markides offered  framework for thinking about strategic innovation thats grounded in three basic questions: Who are your customers? What products or services should you offer them? And how should you offer them? To change the rules of the game in their industry ,  Markides noted ,  companies can either redefine the business ,  redefine who their customers are ,  redefine what they offer customers ,  redefine how they do business ,  or start the strategic thinking process at  different point  for example ,  the organizations unique capabilities 


-  ,  Of course ,  coming up with new ideas for strategic innovation does not guarantee success 


-  Its worth reemphasizing that coming up with new ideas is one thing; succeeding in the market is another ,  Markides wrote 


-  ,  Breakthrough innovation projects necessarily involve  high degree of uncertainty ,  Mark  


-  Rice ,  Gina Colarelli OConnor ,  and Ronald Pierantozzi observed in their 2008 article ,  Implementing  Learning Plan to Counter Project Uncertainty 


-  So ,  rather than try to apply disciplined planning techniques to such innovation projects ,  they proposed that companies focus on identifying and prioritizing the uncertainties that need resolution 


-  ,  The authors developed  framework for turning uncertainty into learning by studying large innovation projects at 10 technology-intensive companies ,  including GE and IBM ,  over  period of seven years 


-  They concluded that ,  in breakthrough projects where the shape of the future market has yet to be determined and where its unclear which applications will succeed ,  identifying milestones to achieve may not be the best approach 


-  ,  Rice ,  OConnor ,  and Pierantozzi suggested that companies develop what they call  learning plan to help teams examine four types of uncertainty: technical ,  market ,  organizational ,  and resource 


-  Managers can use the process ,  the authors wrote ,  to uncover gaps in knowledge and create  record of what is known ,  to prioritize which uncertainties are most critical and propose alternative assumptions about the reality behind each uncertainty ,  and to find ways to test assumptions and resolve the uncertainties as quickly and inexpensively as possible 


-   critical aspect of the approach ,  they argued ,  is proper oversight by people with experience in highly uncertain projects 


-  One risk of using people without such experience is that they may kill promising projects too early 


-  ,  One of the most enduring axioms of business is that ,  irrespective of whether youre running  startup or an established company ,  it pays to be first to market 


-  Golder explained in  1996 article titled First to Market ,  First to Fail? Real Causes of Enduring Market Leadership ,  the case for entering the market before anyone else can be  and often is  overstated and distorted by the nature of the data 


-  The authors pointed out that previous studies finding that pioneering companies gained an advantage had only surveyed surviving pioneers 


-  ,  The authors studied the history of 50 consumer product categories and found that pioneering companies had  high failure rate: 47% 


-  Importantly ,  the authors found that being  market pioneer was less advantageous from  market-share perspective than being what they called an early leader ,  one who enters the market after pioneers but becomes  leader in the markets early growth phase 


-  Early leaders ,  the authors wrote ,  tend to have low failure rates and significantly higher market shares than pioneers 


-  Early leaders had  vision of the mass market for the product; they persisted through business challenges; they were able to commit resources in line with their vision; they innovated relentlessly ,  even if it meant risking  ( or cannibalizing )  their other products; and they leveraged their assets 


-  In the disposable diaper market ,  for example ,   well-reviewed product called Chux predated Procter  Gambles 1961 introduction of Pampers by decades 


-  But P&G managed to leverage its technical and financial resources to build  position in the mass market 


-  market for light beer ,  several products predated the introduction of Miller Lite in the 1970s 


-  To build market share for Miller Lite ,  its parent company was willing to spend heavily on advertising  ( something one of the market pioneers ,  Gablingers ,  didnt do )  


-  ,  The takeaway ,  Tellis and Golder concluded ,  isnt that its better to be  follower than  pioneer 


-  Its that paying attention to the five leadership factors will have more impact on long-term success than whether or not you enter the market first 


-  ,  When developing new products ,  how do you determine what customers want and what they need? This ,  of course ,  is  classic challenge ,  one that managers have labored over for many years 


-  But in  1977 article titled Has  Customer Already Developed Your Next Product?5 Eric  


-  von Hippel of the MIT Sloan School of Management pointed out that many companies fail to take into account critical information thats available to them 


-  In studying manufacturers of scientific instruments and process equipment ,  von Hippel identified  pattern: Most of the innovative products commercialized in those industries were invented ,  prototyped ,  and used in the field by innovative users before equipment or instrument manufacturing firms offered them commercially 


-  Von Hippel found further that the manufacturer who takes advantage of user efforts needs only to contribute product engineering work to obtain  first-to-market product innovation 


-  ,  Users are willing to do innovation work and provide valuable information ,  von Hippel wrote ,  if they need the new product as much as or more than you do 


-   big challenge ,  though ,  is convincing internal people to accept the validity of information and ideas that come from the outside 


-  ,  Von Hippel further explored the user innovation theme in subsequent MIT SMR articles ,  including The Age of the Consumer-Innovator ,  which he coauthored with Susumu Ogawa and Jeroen  


-  In that article ,  von Hippel ,  Ogawa ,  and de Jong reported on new national surveys finding that individual consumers play an important role in both creating and modifying products 


-  Businesses ,  von Hippel ,  Ogawa ,  and de Jong advised ,  need to think about how to reorganize their product development systems to efficiently accept and build upon prototypes developed by users 


-  ,  In  fascinating 2007 article titled Breakthroughs and the Long Tail of Innovation ,  Lee Fleming explored the dynamics of invention 


-  Defining invention as  new combination of components ,  ideas ,  or processes ,  he explained that invention samples show an extremely skewed distribution ,  with the vast majority of inventions being useless ,   few having some value ,  and only  very few representing breakthroughs 


-  ,  As  result ,  Fleming argued that if companies want to achieve breakthroughs they should:  (  )  make lots of shots on goal ,  since only  few of the inventions they come up with will be breakthroughs;  (  )  try to increase the average value of each invention; and  (  )  increase the variability of the ideas they explore  in other words ,  take wild shots at  rich target  ( or preferably  set of rich targets )  because the wider range will be more likely to contain scores of maximum values 


-  Flemings research indicated that inventors working by themselves can be the source of more failures as well as more breakthroughs 


-  On average ,  lone inventors are not as creative or as successful as innovative teams  but ,  paradoxically ,  the loners are more likely to be the source of breakthroughs because the value of their inventions is so highly variable 


-  One challenge for companies ,  then ,  is finding ways to support and manage their lone inventors 


-  ,  Knowing when and how to open up product development to outsiders is difficult 


-  Which approach is better ,  working with external innovators organized into collaborative communities  ( as typified by Linux and other open-source software projects )  or tapping into the competitive marketplace for products and services to complement your product? According to Kevin  


-  In their 2009 article titled How to Manage Outside Innovation ,  the authors wrote that the decisions companies make about external innovation should be based on clarity about  (  )  the type of innovation they need from outside innovators;  (  )  the motivations of the outside innovators; and  (  )  the nature of the companys business model 


-  When the technology and consumer preferences are clear ,  Boudreau and Lakhani wrote ,  companies generally dont need external innovation: They can develop products internally or hire contractors 


-  However ,  in cases where some of the design elements are still being determined ,  opening up the innovation process can lead to significant benefits 


-  Collaborative communities generally work best when dealing with problems that draw on cumulative knowledge that extends beyond what individuals are likely to know 


-  Competitive markets ,  according to Boudreau and Lakhani ,  are better suited for problems that would benefit from broad experimentation across  set of technical approaches or customer groups 


-  Participants in competitive markets tend to be motivated by extrinsic factors such as financial rewards ,  while collaborative communities involve  greater emphasis on intrinsic rewards ,  such as intellectual challenge 


-  When evaluating whether to work with collaborative communities or competitive markets ,  companies should be aware of the different motivators and consider the type of mechanisms needed to align with them 


-  ,  The third issue managers need to take into consideration when deciding to open their products to external innovation is how that will affect their companys business model 


-  In determining whether to work with  collaborative community or  competitive market ,  the authors noted that its helpful to ask ,  Who sells to whom? The answer will affect the income streams ,  the companys relationship with its customers ,  and the future role external innovators will play 


-  ,  Opening your product to external innovation means that it will become  platform ,  Boudreau and Lakhani explained ,  and executives must decide which type of platform business model makes the most sense for their business 


-  Companies can either integrate external innovators work into their platform ,  allow external innovators to sell products on top of the platform ,  or create two-sided markets where external innovators and customers can interact 


-  ,  Luckily ,  the authors noted ,   companys innovation strategy neednt be cast in stone 


-  As the needs of the business change ,  the innovation strategy can change as well 


-  Initially ,  for example ,  Apple had  small group of partners producing applications for its iPhone 


-  The lesson ,  Boudreau and Lakhani wrote ,  is that a company needs to tailor its particular approach to the context of its specific business 


-  Sinfield explained in their 2008 article Institutionalizing Innovation ,  companies that are seasoned innovators have  set of capabilities that can take them from  plan for growth all the way through execution 


-  ,  The authors developed their insights into innovation from interviews at more than 40 organizations in an array of industries ,   survey ,  and fieldwork at more than 50 companies 


-  ,  So ,  how can companies move in this direction? As  starting point ,  management needs to develop  growth blueprint that articulates what the company wants to be  and the specific options it will and wont consider to reach its objectives 


-  ,  Another important element ,  according to Anthony ,  Johnson ,  and Sinfield ,  is determining how the company wants to allocate resources  both money and time  to satisfy its growth objectives 


-  One approach is balancing the innovation portfolio with  mix of improvements to the core business ,  extensions to it ,  and growth initiatives in new areas 


-  If  company fails to consciously allocate innovation resources among different types of projects ,  the authors noted ,  it will often end up with mostly incremental innovation projects 


-  Whats more ,  if the core business runs into trouble ,  there is an overwhelming temptation to tap resources that the company has allocated to more speculative ventures in order to save the company ,  they wrote 


-  ,  Although Anthony ,  Johnson ,  and Sinfield highlighted numerous questions that would-be innovators need to confront ,  they were careful not to be overly prescriptive about the answers 


-  Even within  single company ,  they argued ,  managers should be prepared to manage and measure different types of growth opportunities differently 


-  ,  Companies also need to construct what the authors called an innovation engine  which involves structures to screen ,  develop ,  and oversee innovative projects 


-  The authors pointed out that there are  number of different innovation structures that companies can use 


-  ,  Companies are increasingly trying to bring outside ideas into their innovation processes 


-  To do so effectively requires an understanding of two types of innovation brokers ,  according to Eoin Whelan ,  Salvatore Parise ,  Jasper de Valk ,  and Rick Aalbers 


-  In their 2011 article Creating Employee Networks That Deliver Open Innovation , 10 the authors drew on research they had conducted on the diffusion of innovative ideas through personal networks in companies 


-  Whelan ,  Parise ,  de Valk ,  and Aalbers explained the importance of both idea scouts and idea connectors 


-  Idea scouts excel at identifying novel external ideas ,  often via the web 


-  But ,  to effectively implement such ideas ,  the external focus of idea scouts needs to be complemented by interactions with employees who have extensive networks and influence within the company and  broad knowledge base   group the authors called idea connectors 


-  ,  Many R&D leaders pursuing external ideas through open innovation tend to emphasize only the role of idea scouts  which the authors see as  mistake 


-  Companies ,  they advised ,  should be thinking about formal mechanisms that bring idea scouts and idea connectors together 


-  Promising ideas ,  the authors wrote ,  will not mature into innovative outcomes unless they reach the parts of the employee network that have the expertise and influence to exploit them 


-  Williamson and Eden Yin ,  Chinese companies are tackling innovation in  fundamentally different way: Rather than going for major breakthroughs ,  they aim for faster development cycles 


-  For their 2014 article Accelerated Innovation: The New Challenge From China , 11 Williamson and Yin studied more than 20 Chinese companies in  variety of industries and found that by breaking the innovation process into small steps and parceling it out to teams ,  companies were able to complete projects and deliver results faster 


-  ,  For example ,  an outsourcing company serving the pharmaceutical ,  biopharmaceutical ,  and medical device industries was able to complete projects two to five times faster than comparable projects using conventional techniques 


-  ,  which had acquired IBMs personal computer business 


-  By breaking product designs into modules handled by small teams in parallel ,  it managed to cut its new product development cycle time in half 


-  Williamson and Yin acknowledged that many of the processes and techniques used by Chinese companies are also being employed by technology companies in places like Silicon Valley 


-  ,  Its common for companies to solicit ideas and feedback from their customers and then incorporate what they learn into future products and services 


-  But few have taken customer knowledge as seriously or as far as the Lego Group 


-  In recent years ,  the Danish toy company ,  whose multicolored plastic construction toys have been popular with children for decades ,  has actively explored new and productive ways to engage with the users of its products 


-  These collaborations have led Lego to surprising new areas of growth ,  the authors wrote in their 2012 article Collaborating With Customer Communities: Lessons From the Lego Group 


- 12 ,  Historically ,  Lego built products for younger children ,  but in the 1990s ,  it unveiled  new series of products that appealed to older users 


-  Lego user groups expanded globally ,  and innovative products produced by users  ( for example ,   computer-aided design software program for designing Lego models )  began appearing 


-  As the authors pointed out ,  many of the innovations from fans improved and extended the Lego building system or introduced new ways to use it that dovetailed well with how Lego itself thought of its products 


-  The company began reaching out to the fan community to solicit marketing ideas or feedback on products in development 


-  At times ,  Lego management found that adult fans lost sight of the fact that the companys primary end users were children ,  not adults 


-  In some cases ,  fans suggested applications that went beyond the parameters of what the products were designed for 


-  ,  From its experience working with its user groups ,  Lego developed  number of principles for working with customers in product development 


-  ( This includes being as clear as possible about the companys parameters for when projects are expected to begin and end 


-  )  Another lesson management learned was that relationships cant be one way: They need to be not only good for the company but also rewarding for users 


-  Instead of regarding collaboration as something that needs to be managed exclusively by the company ,  the authors wrote ,  it is fruitful to think of it as an ongoing dialogue between two allies 


-  ,  In the past ,  corporate managers often rose through the ranks and thus were very knowledgeable about the activities they supervised 


-  But the rapid changes brought about by technology have created  widening gulf between the expertise of managers and specialized technical employees  something Robert  


-  In  2007 article titled Bridging the Gap Between Stewards and Creators , 13 they wrote: Being  good supervisor traditionally meant encouraging sound business practices and introducing changes to those practices as conditions changed 


-   Now the changes sometimes come from key employees whose work managers dont completely understand 


-  ,  Conflicts between business-oriented managers and technical employees arent new 


-  Almost 50 years ago ,  management guru Peter Drucker highlighted both the importance of knowledge workers and the challenges companies face in managing them 


-  From  study of the development of the internet and interviews with internet pioneers ,  Austin and Nolan saw how misunderstandings between business-oriented managers  ( whom the authors called stewards )  and highly skilled technical employees  ( whom they termed creators )  caused delays in the adoption of new technologies 


-  Creators ,  on the other hand ,  were less concerned about overall efficiency and what was in the business plan and more focused on what they saw as  higher purpose and vision 


-  One of their guidelines for managers is to avoid antagonizing creators ,  even if it means putting up with someone who is difficult to manage; an effort to get rid of one creator could snowball into losing two or three ,  leaving the company short on key creative talent 


-  ,  The challenges in managing someone who never wants to do the same thing twice and who keeps going off on tangents are substantial and quite different from the more traditional challenges managers face ,  the authors observed
