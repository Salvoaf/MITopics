-  ,  For this article ,  we tapped into that knowledge base 


-  Wolcott ,  and Inigo Arroniz encouraged executives to think broadly about what types of innovation are possible 


-  The authors presented an innovation radar so companies can consider 12 different areas in which they might innovate  ranging from method of value capture to operating processes to platforms 


-  For example ,  Southwest Airlines changed the rules of the airline industry when it chose to fly its planes point-to-point rather than through hub cities 


-  ,  Markides offered  framework for thinking about strategic innovation thats grounded in three basic questions: Who are your customers? What products or services should you offer them? And how should you offer them? To change the rules of the game in their industry ,  Markides noted ,  companies can either redefine the business ,  redefine who their customers are ,  redefine what they offer customers ,  redefine how they do business ,  or start the strategic thinking process at  different point  for example ,  the organizations unique capabilities 


-  So ,  rather than try to apply disciplined planning techniques to such innovation projects ,  they proposed that companies focus on identifying and prioritizing the uncertainties that need resolution 


-  In such scenarios ,  Rice ,  OConnor ,  and Pierantozzi wrote ,  it is more reasonable and useful to identify and prioritize uncertainties that must be resolved ,  to define alternative approaches to exploring them ,  and to continually assess the value of cumulative learning compared to the costs incurred 


-  Managers can use the process ,  the authors wrote ,  to uncover gaps in knowledge and create  record of what is known ,  to prioritize which uncertainties are most critical and propose alternative assumptions about the reality behind each uncertainty ,  and to find ways to test assumptions and resolve the uncertainties as quickly and inexpensively as possible 


-   critical aspect of the approach ,  they argued ,  is proper oversight by people with experience in highly uncertain projects 


-  Golder explained in  1996 article titled First to Market ,  First to Fail? Real Causes of Enduring Market Leadership ,  the case for entering the market before anyone else can be  and often is  overstated and distorted by the nature of the data 


-  ,  Tellis and Golder found that the early leaders they studied excelled in comparison to pioneers on five factors 


-  To build market share for Miller Lite ,  its parent company was willing to spend heavily on advertising  ( something one of the market pioneers ,  Gablingers ,  didnt do )  


-  Its that paying attention to the five leadership factors will have more impact on long-term success than whether or not you enter the market first 


-  ,  When developing new products ,  how do you determine what customers want and what they need? This ,  of course ,  is  classic challenge ,  one that managers have labored over for many years 


-  In studying manufacturers of scientific instruments and process equipment ,  von Hippel identified  pattern: Most of the innovative products commercialized in those industries were invented ,  prototyped ,  and used in the field by innovative users before equipment or instrument manufacturing firms offered them commercially 


-  Von Hippel found further that the manufacturer who takes advantage of user efforts needs only to contribute product engineering work to obtain  first-to-market product innovation 


-  ,  Users are willing to do innovation work and provide valuable information ,  von Hippel wrote ,  if they need the new product as much as or more than you do 


-  Whats more ,  the authors noted ,  advances in areas such as computer-aided design tools and 3-D printing mean that consumers should realize that it is getting progressively easier to design and make what they want for themselves 


-  Businesses ,  von Hippel ,  Ogawa ,  and de Jong advised ,  need to think about how to reorganize their product development systems to efficiently accept and build upon prototypes developed by users 


-  Defining invention as  new combination of components ,  ideas ,  or processes ,  he explained that invention samples show an extremely skewed distribution ,  with the vast majority of inventions being useless ,   few having some value ,  and only  very few representing breakthroughs 


-  ,  As  result ,  Fleming argued that if companies want to achieve breakthroughs they should:  (  )  make lots of shots on goal ,  since only  few of the inventions they come up with will be breakthroughs;  (  )  try to increase the average value of each invention; and  (  )  increase the variability of the ideas they explore  in other words ,  take wild shots at  rich target  ( or preferably  set of rich targets )  because the wider range will be more likely to contain scores of maximum values 


-  In their 2009 article titled How to Manage Outside Innovation ,  the authors wrote that the decisions companies make about external innovation should be based on clarity about  (  )  the type of innovation they need from outside innovators;  (  )  the motivations of the outside innovators; and  (  )  the nature of the companys business model 


-  When the technology and consumer preferences are clear ,  Boudreau and Lakhani wrote ,  companies generally dont need external innovation: They can develop products internally or hire contractors 


-  Collaborative communities generally work best when dealing with problems that draw on cumulative knowledge that extends beyond what individuals are likely to know 


-  ,  Just as there are different forms of outside innovation ,  managers need to recognize that what motivates external innovators varies 


-  Participants in competitive markets tend to be motivated by extrinsic factors such as financial rewards ,  while collaborative communities involve  greater emphasis on intrinsic rewards ,  such as intellectual challenge 


-  When evaluating whether to work with collaborative communities or competitive markets ,  companies should be aware of the different motivators and consider the type of mechanisms needed to align with them 


-  ,  The third issue managers need to take into consideration when deciding to open their products to external innovation is how that will affect their companys business model 


-  ,  Opening your product to external innovation means that it will become  platform ,  Boudreau and Lakhani explained ,  and executives must decide which type of platform business model makes the most sense for their business 


-  ,  Luckily ,  the authors noted ,   companys innovation strategy neednt be cast in stone 


-  As the needs of the business change ,  the innovation strategy can change as well 


-  But within  matter of months ,  outside developers had developed more than 100 unauthorized applications ,  prompting Apple to rethink its decision and to establish licensing terms and revenue-sharing arrangements 


-  The lesson ,  Boudreau and Lakhani wrote ,  is that a company needs to tailor its particular approach to the context of its specific business 


-  ,  The most innovative companies know how to do more than simply produce occasional winners 


-  Sinfield explained in their 2008 article Institutionalizing Innovation ,  companies that are seasoned innovators have  set of capabilities that can take them from  plan for growth all the way through execution 


-  They found that companies that create blueprints for growth ,  construct innovation engines ,  and support the engines with the right systems and mindsets can establish favorable conditions for substantial innovation 


-  ,  So ,  how can companies move in this direction? As  starting point ,  management needs to develop  growth blueprint that articulates what the company wants to be  and the specific options it will and wont consider to reach its objectives 


-  ,  Another important element ,  according to Anthony ,  Johnson ,  and Sinfield ,  is determining how the company wants to allocate resources  both money and time  to satisfy its growth objectives 


-  In the short run ,  this may make perfect sense; in the long run ,  it can be disastrous 


-  ,  Although Anthony ,  Johnson ,  and Sinfield highlighted numerous questions that would-be innovators need to confront ,  they were careful not to be overly prescriptive about the answers 


-  Even within  single company ,  they argued ,  managers should be prepared to manage and measure different types of growth opportunities differently 


-  ,  Companies also need to construct what the authors called an innovation engine  which involves structures to screen ,  develop ,  and oversee innovative projects 


-  To do so effectively requires an understanding of two types of innovation brokers ,  according to Eoin Whelan ,  Salvatore Parise ,  Jasper de Valk ,  and Rick Aalbers 


-  Whelan ,  Parise ,  de Valk ,  and Aalbers explained the importance of both idea scouts and idea connectors 


-  But ,  to effectively implement such ideas ,  the external focus of idea scouts needs to be complemented by interactions with employees who have extensive networks and influence within the company and  broad knowledge base   group the authors called idea connectors 


-  Companies ,  they advised ,  should be thinking about formal mechanisms that bring idea scouts and idea connectors together 


-  Williamson and Yin acknowledged that many of the processes and techniques used by Chinese companies are also being employed by technology companies in places like Silicon Valley 


-  But few have taken customer knowledge as seriously or as far as the Lego Group 


-  ,  and Tormod Askildsen noted ,  Through trial and error ,  Lego has developed  solid understanding of what it takes to build and maintain profitable and beneficial collaborations with users 


-  At times ,  Lego management found that adult fans lost sight of the fact that the companys primary end users were children ,  not adults 


-  )  Another lesson management learned was that relationships cant be one way: They need to be not only good for the company but also rewarding for users 


-  Instead of regarding collaboration as something that needs to be managed exclusively by the company ,  the authors wrote ,  it is fruitful to think of it as an ongoing dialogue between two allies 


-  ,  In the past ,  corporate managers often rose through the ranks and thus were very knowledgeable about the activities they supervised 


-  But the rapid changes brought about by technology have created  widening gulf between the expertise of managers and specialized technical employees  something Robert  


-  Nolan warned that companies aspiring to be technologically innovative will need to address or suffer the consequences 


-   Now the changes sometimes come from key employees whose work managers dont completely understand 


-  Almost 50 years ago ,  management guru Peter Drucker highlighted both the importance of knowledge workers and the challenges companies face in managing them 


-  From  study of the development of the internet and interviews with internet pioneers ,  Austin and Nolan saw how misunderstandings between business-oriented managers  ( whom the authors called stewards )  and highly skilled technical employees  ( whom they termed creators )  caused delays in the adoption of new technologies 


-  The challenge ,  they explained ,  is learning how to manage the tension ,  for which they put forth  set of guidelines 


-  One of their guidelines for managers is to avoid antagonizing creators ,  even if it means putting up with someone who is difficult to manage; an effort to get rid of one creator could snowball into losing two or three ,  leaving the company short on key creative talent 


-  ,  The challenges in managing someone who never wants to do the same thing twice and who keeps going off on tangents are substantial and quite different from the more traditional challenges managers face ,  the authors observed
