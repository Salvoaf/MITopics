-  Working with external partners allows them to access different pools of knowledge and save R&D costs 


-  Universities are among the external partners that offer high promise ,  since they allow access to an enormous global pool of talent and skills 


-  ,  Sometimes managers think dealing with universities equals only technology transfer 


-  While the use of university-owned intellectual property2 has spurred much innovation in business ,  it is only the tip of the iceberg 


-  For example ,  in the United Kingdom ,  businesses already spend more than 20 times more on university collaboration than on licensing technology from universities 


-  ,  However ,  working with universities poses considerable challenges for managers 


-  Two fundamental issues afflict collaboration 


-  First ,  the open nature of academic science is at times in conflict with companies need to protect technologies they use 


-  Second ,  while academic research focuses on long-term challenges and thus may move more slowly ,  industrial R&D is driven by time-sensitive product development projects and day-to-day project solving 


-  As  result ,  companies can sometimes find universities too slow and too bureaucratic to be good partners 


-  Given that in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries ,  expenditures on higher education R&D represent about $160 billion per annum ,  businesses that dont work with universities may be missing opportunities of significant proportions 


-  Managers who would never dream of leaving their customer or supplier relationships to chance may take an ad hoc approach to their university relationships ,  which can lead to duplication of effort ,  lost opportunities or squabbles over intellectual property 


-  ,  Our research suggests that businesses can structure their relationships with universities in ways that make them much more valuable 


-  As Claus Otto ,  program manager at Royal Dutch Shell PLC ,  says ,  It is important to ask yourself: What can these university centers do better or different than we can? Shell ,  for example ,  invests in university partnerships in areas where it does not yet make business sense for the company to build extensive technology capability 


-  ,  To leverage value from universities ,  we argue that business executives need to consider two key dimensions 


-  Short-term collaborations are useful ,  common and relatively easy to facilitate if they are targeted and aligned to universities and academics ways of working 


-  However ,  they require creative structuring ,  as the clock speed of academic research and business practice can be wildly divergent 


-  Conversely ,  many academics think long-term ,  and this can be an advantage for  business as it may overcome managers tendency to look to the next quarter 


-  Going long with academics in the search for new ideas can unlock  range of possibilities and even help to create  new innovation ecosystem that will sustain the business five or 10 years into the future 


-  However ,  such long-term collaborations require more patient investment and managerial attention to the design and governance of the collaboration or they can go easily awry 


-  ,  The second dimension is the degree of disclosure of the results of the partnership 


-  ,  If we combine these two dimensions ,  we can see four different collaboration modes: ,  In this type of collaboration ,  businesses engage university partners to work on problems that are relatively short-term ,  while providing the option for the academics to openly publish results 


-  At first glance ,  this type of collaboration seems to provide little benefit to companies ,  given that they are not able to exclusively appropriate research outcomes 


-  First ,  it can act as  honey pot ,  helping to attract academics to the problems and challenges of the business 


-  As these projects are well aligned to academic norms ,  many scientists find ways of drawing academic capital even from incremental ,  applied research 


-  These projects are usually small scale and ,  given the absence of delicate intellectual property issues ,  easy to set up and administer 


-  One successful example of this approach is HP Laboratories Innovation Research Program 


-  Every year ,  HP Labs solicits ideas from academics on selected research topics with the aim of building new research collaborations 


-  Although the size of the grants is modest  ( $50 , 000$75 , 000 )  ,  HP receives around 500 proposals per year ,  selecting close to 50 


-  To manage intellectual property for these projects ,  HP Labs uses  standardized collaborative research agreement that entitles academics to publish their results ,  but it also provides HP with the nonexclusive right to use the findings 


-  Another example is Bayer AGs Grants4Targets program ,  which provides grants ranging from $5 , 000 to $125 , 000 to researchers wishing to explore and validate drug targets 


-  The bureaucracy is consciously kept to  minimum ,  and successful applicants are allocated  Bayer scientist as project partner 


-  ,  These types of programs allow companies to test  professors aptitude to work on industry-related projects and his or her ability to manage projects in  timely manner 


-  To this purpose ,  companies should choose projects that are relatively low risk and that do not result in major opportunity costs or other damage if they fail 


-  Often ,  this type of project is about testing ideas that company R&D personnel may have but that do not yet warrant  major investment within the company 


-  Establishing small-scale collaborations with  number of players ,  possibly internationally ,  constitutes  cost-effective way to test the waters in  variety of emerging research areas 


-  IBM Faculty Awards ,  for example ,  is  program that allows IBM to gain insights into the cutting edge of research from across the world at  modest cost 


-  No intellectual property is stipulated as part of the award ,  and IBM strongly encourages the research results to be published 


-  ,  How should companies undertake such short-term open explorations? First ,  it is important for companies to explain the problems in  way that will help academics work toward useful solutions 


-  Third ,  the emphasis in managing the project should not be on timely delivery ,  but on the results 


-  From  companys perspective ,  outcomes are likely to be highly skewed ,  with  number of projects that will yield some results but that will not necessarily produce eureka moments ,  and  number of failures 


-  However ,  if  series of projects are pursued in  portfolio ,  this risk can be mitigated ,  in part because the cost of each project is rather low 


-  An executive at  major oil company told us that he was happy if 20% of such exploratory projects resulted in some positive output after two years 


-  ,   further risk is that  company may fail to absorb the lessons from these kinds of projects ,  as in many cases follow-on projects are required to gain the full benefit of the research 


-  To ensure that these risks are overcome ,  managers should seek to deepen and extend the most promising relationships by assigning an internal champion to work alongside the external academic partner and creating  more long-term arrangement 


-  ,  Working on open and long-term grand challenges is the sweet spot for most academics ,  who often thrive on big problems 


- 11 Yet all results from this research are placed in the public domain with no restrictions 


-  ,  What do companies gain from sponsoring such open innovation projects? For companies ,  it can make sense to fund open ,  long-term research even though they may forfeit the ability to appropriate the results in  legal sense 


- 12 In pharmaceuticals ,  for example ,  executives are well aware that the cost of developing drugs is constantly rising while research productivity is declining 


-  In this situation ,  Malcolm Skingle ,  director of academic liaison at GlaxoSmithKline ,  believes it may make sense to invest collectively in building an industry commons to instigate  game change in the speed of new knowledge creation 


-  His counterparts at Merck ,  Novartis and Pfizer agree and have invested together in open science initiatives even though they are otherwise fierce competitors 


-  ,  Second ,  companies may seek to create new fields and markets by funding new research programs 


-  Such research is bound to diffuse more quickly and widely than results from more protected initiatives ,  and it allows companies therefore to shape emerging fields 


-  For instance ,  IBM has funded major research initiatives in service science ,  allowing it to shape problems and agendas of this newly emerging discipline 


- 13 Open research programs can attract follow-on research by academics that may not have been part of the original initiative 


- 14 For example ,  after Arup Group Ltd 


-  One example is  five-year grand challenge on cleaner fossil fuels between Royal Dutch Shell and Imperial College London 


-  Launched in 2007 ,  the project focuses on developing technologies that reduce the carbon impact of extracting hydrocarbons 


-  Such leverage may compensate for the lack of ability to appropriate the returns of the initial investment 


-  As Stuart Feldman said when he was vice president for computer science at IBMs research laboratories: Universities have made life increasingly difficult to do research with them because of all the contractual issues around intellectual property 


-  Some successful initiatives were built with special-purpose vehicles to take on both strategy and day-to-day management 


-  When GlaxoSmithKline helped start the Structural Genomics Consortium ,  the partners set up the consortium as an independent entity   not-for-profit company headquartered in Toronto ,  governed by  board of directors composed of members of the participating pharmaceutical companies and other funders ,  including the Wellcome Trust 


-  Aled Edwards ,   life sciences professor who is also the founder of  biotech company and hence commanded respect in both the academic and commercial realms ,  was recruited as CEO 


-  Led by  CEO with  wide-ranging mandate ,  special-purpose vehicles can be an effective way to overcome the paralysis that often afflicts bilateral or multilateral committees 


-  Therefore ,  company sponsors not only need to be present at  strategic level but also need to be involved on  technical level 


-  An additional benefit of being closely involved on  technical level is being better able to absorb the outcomes of the research 


-  ,  for example ,  has structured its Science and Technology Centers and International Institutes with engagement at both levels 


-  Moreover ,  large ,  open collaborations do not preclude the launch of more specific point projects that can follow other models ,  if necessary 


-  ,  Even when an initiative is open ,  companies need to be careful that proprietary information is not released into the public domain 


-  To maximize sponsor influence ,  and minimize knowledge leakage ,  the Structural Genomics Consortium devised  mechanism whereby sponsors requirements were kept confidential ,  both within the organization and from the outside world 


-  The SGC management was  trusted broker that carefully managed information flows and prevented leakage 


-  ,  University researchers can be particularly capable partners for non-routine problems because they have access to the brainpower of highly specialized research groups and bring  different perspective than that in corporate environments 


-  They usually are also less vested in commercial interests compared to suppliers ,  vendors and consultants ,  who may have their preferred solutions to problems 


-  ,  For example ,  an international engine manufacturer we studied experienced some unexpected problems with an innovative prototype engine 


-  The engine performed wonderfully in most aspects ,  but occasionally it blew up 


-  Company R&D engineers were at  loss to explain these failures and decided to turn to their university partners for help 


-  For the company ,  this was  burning short-term problem that required highly developed analytical capabilities 


-  From their point of view ,  the opportunity cost can be high 


-  In addition ,  these projects are usually highly confidential ,  and the business needs to protect the problem and the solution 


-  This limits the academic partners ability to extract academic capital by publishing the results 


-  ,  The trick is to make these projects more attractive to academics by making them part of  longer-term relationship 


-  In the above example ,  the engine manufacturer already had long-term relationships with the research groups ,  and it was therefore easier to persuade them to engage in firefighting 


-   former global head of university partnerships at  major defense company explained that traditionally it was difficult to recruit academics for short-term contracts 


-  This changed when he started  company-wide university partnership program that weeded out nonproductive relationships and put the successful ones on  stronger footing 


-  Relationships forged on the anvil of  pressing problem may generate the trust to enable richer and deeper future research collaborations 


-  Academics may also find that such projects provide  stimulus to their own research questions ,  framing an interesting problem for them to later investigate with greater theoretical and empirical precision 


-  ,  The benefit of these types of projects for companies is that they can set objectives for collaboration and expect delivery on these objectives as they would from  commercial organization 


-  Such projects allow companies to quickly expand their existing stock of expertise and skills and produce tangible outcomes ,  focused around  live problem or issue in the company 


-  They also allow the business to keep the nature and solution to its problems confidential ,  excluding others from the potential solution 


-  ,  Although short-term ,  protected collaboration can be highly attractive and remain  common form of collaboration ,  such projects rely on businesses to have  rich Rolodex of academic contacts whom they trust and can work with ,  and whose research areas are closely matched to the businesss problems 


-  Some companies have developed  university engagement database ,  similar to  customer relationship management database ,  to track ,  assess and value different university contacts 


-  Businesses may want to put selected academics on consulting retainers so that they are well positioned to attend to problems as they emerge rather than arriving after the problem has already taken hold 


-  Some companies use open idea lab projects to form new contacts 


-  For instance ,  many universities have consultancy service offices that are experienced in drawing up contracts and offer professional indemnity insurance coverage 


-  For larger projects ,  most universities have business partnership units or industry liaison programs that take care of the contractual and administrative side of collaborations ,  help recruit sponsors and liaise with academics and departments ,  acting as  centralized point of contact for the university and its industrial partners 


-  In many cases ,  such activities are pursued from within the technology transfer offices18 that will also be responsible for dealing with any intellectual property arising from their projects 


-  Universities can also be overly optimistic about the value of the intellectual property that may arise from the collaboration ,  even though only  minority of collaborative university-industry projects results in patentable output 


- 21 ,  In order to avoid such conflicts ,  managers should proactively seek to build relationships with university outreach offices 


-  One approach that can help avoid protracted negotiations is to invest in framework agreements with key university partners 


-  These agreements offer  set of model contracts and  rapid-fire system for launching contract research agreements 


-  An example of this approach can be seen in Procter  Gambles collaborative agreements with the University System of Ohio in the United States ,  Durham University in the United Kingdom ,  and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel 


-  This allows the company to provide  more scalable approach to adding new sponsors and universities to its large institutes ,  while enforcing  consistent governance model and avoiding an undue administrative burden for its partner universities 


-  ,  Long-term ,  deep and protected collaborations with universities enable companies to not only create new knowledge ,  but also to gain competitive advantage from the outputs of these research efforts 


-  This approach allows the researchers to do the long-term work they do best ,  and the company to preempt its competitors from accessing the downstream application of these ideas 


-  ,  Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC is an example of  company that has applied the deep exploration approach 


-  Twenty years ago ,  the company established the first Rolls-Royce University Technology Centres with universities in Britain 


-  Each of the centers focuses on  specialized area of technological expertise ,  such as combustion ,  aerodynamics ,  noise and vibration or manufacturing technology 


-  This allows the company to maintain centers of excellence that are more resourceful and specialized than it would be able to justify internally 


-  Each of the centers is funded for five-year intervals ,  and renewals are common provided specific performance milestones are met 


-  ,  For companies ,  the attractiveness of such deep explorations is that they allow the business to exert some control over the direction of the research program ,  guiding researchers into areas that are more relevant and useful to the company 


-  Such agreements also ensure  strong alignment between the companys R&D strategy and research ,  helping to overcome the tendency toward agenda drift associated with more open grand challenges 


-  Through the intellectual property provisions in such relationships ,  companies can also mitigate the danger of knowledge leakage by their university partners 


-  Moreover ,  they can invest more deeply in the collaboration ,  disclosing critical ideas to their external partners to learn more effectively together 


-  ,  This approach is ,  however ,  not cheap 


-  Often ,  the price of exclusivity is high and requires parallel investments from the business to make it work successfully 


-   typical mechanism for deep explorations is to set up  medium-term agreement  ( often more than three years )  with an academic partner to establish  new center or invest in an existing center 


-  Within the agreement ,  it is important to specify the relationship between the company and research organizations and how payments may be tied to specific milestones or achievements 


-  For example ,  Pfizers 2006 agreement with The Scripps Research Institute22 provided $100 million of research funding for five years 


-  In exchange for the support ,  Pfizer claimed the right of first refusal to license almost half of the discoveries Scripps makes 


-  As part of the agreement ,  Pfizer has to decide within one or two months whether to exercise its licensing option on  discovery 


-  If Pfizer does not exercise its option ,  Scripps can seek alternative industrial partners to exploit the idea 


-  Businesses may find that academics promise one thing and deliver another 


-  In one university-industry research center we studied ,  we found that the same project had been sold to the industry partner twice 


-  Fundamentally ,  agreements like deep explorations create incentive problems for academics ,  since many of them seek to publish and diffuse their work rather than produce innovations that will be exclusively licensed by  corporate sponsor 


- 23 Managers in some industries ,  such as pharmaceuticals and oil ,  have to be particularly careful in this respect 


-  When the agribusiness arm of Novartis entered into  landmark $25-million contract with the Department of Plant  Microbial Biology at the University of California ,  Berkeley ,  in 1998 ,  it seeded  controversy revolving around the appropriation of open research by private interests and led to an external review 


-  and other firms signed  10-year ,  $225-million deal with Stanford University to fund the Global Climate and Energy Project 


-  ,  There are ways to overcome many of these problems 


-  First ,  because many academics work with industry primarily to further their academic research programs ,  it is important for businesses to offer academics access to interesting problems ,  data or equipment 


-  Providing them with interesting clues or problems will often result in solutions that interest both the business and the academic community 


- 25 Second ,  any decision to patent  discovery or restrict publications due to confidential information in  deep exploration partnership requires fast approval processes so that academics are not left waiting to know whether they may publish or not 


-  Businesses must agree with their academic partners on  streamlined system for managing disclosures ,  whereby academics are allowed to publish important but noncritical findings around an invention 


-  For example ,  rewarding inventors with academic prizes for major discoveries ,  such as endowed chairs or multiyear fellowships ,  may help motivate ,  recruit and retain junior faculty 


-  Some universities are highly skilled at working with industrial partners ,  collaborating frequently with industry  whereas others have limited experience 


-  Managers should carefully assess the level of collaborative capability of their potential university partners ,  avoiding costly and time-consuming setup costs and the possibility of later disputes over the ownership of ideas 


-  For example ,  in most countries ,  the inventions of academics are owned by their universities 


-  ,  When determining the best model to follow with  university partner ,  managers should carefully assess the nature of the university they are working with 


-  By balancing considerations such as time horizon and degree of openness ,  managers can turn universities into valuable partners in both the short and long run  provided the relationships are designed in advance to meet both organizations goals
