- Customer-oriented companies pride themselves on their ability to understand the experiences and insights of the marketplace and then integrate the best ideas into future products 


-  But what would it be like if you found that you had hundreds if not thousands of knowledgeable users of your products ready and eager to spend nights and weekends acting as extensions of your research and development department? For the Lego Group ,   maker of childrens creative construction toys based in Billund ,  Denmark ,  this close bond with the user community  not just children but  large coterie of adults who have been using its products for years  is not  pipe dream but  reality 


-  As Lego managers became more aware of innovations by the companys adult fans ,  the managers realized that at least some of the adult fans ideas would be interesting to the companys core target market of children 


-  The program has provided considerable value to both sides 


-  ,  Through trial and error ,  Lego has developed  solid understanding of what it takes to build and maintain profitable and mutually beneficial collaborations with users 


-  By 1999 ,  there were 11 known Lego user groups ,  mainly located in North America 


-  And by February 2012 ,  there were more than 150 known user groups ,  with over 100 , 000 active adult fans worldwide 


-  ,  In developing innovations ,  adult Lego users tap into  deep understanding and knowledge of the companys product line ,  its possibilities and its limitations 


-  LDraw allows users to export and import Lego parts lists from their designs to online shops listed on the BrickLink site ,  enabling them to identify and order the exact elements they need to create their models 


-  Cumulatively ,  the fan activity represents  vast library of free ideas available to anyone 


-  After all ,  many of the adult users didnt know or care about designing products for the companys target market  children 


-  Meanwhile ,  Lego experienced  turbulent period from 1998 to 2004  ( unrelated to its involvement with the user community )  ,  characterized by escalating competitive pressures and financial losses 


-  ,  The appointment of  new CEO ,  Jrgen Vig Knudstorp ,  in 2004 provided the opportunity for Lego to reflect on the meaning of the brand as well as the value of the companys ties with the user community 


-  Other reasons to consider partnering are when the target market is too small or  partners cost structure is much lower  ( as was the case with the electronic sensors )  


-  In such circumstances ,  Lego has benefited from having passionate fans with deep and specialized knowledge of Lego building along with their own specific expertise 


-  ,  Cocreating knowledge-intensive innovations with users allows Lego to obtain the skills and knowledge important to these activities 


-  By hiring experienced users ,  Lego can benefit from the extensive knowledge and skills these users have accumulated over the years 


-  ,  Based on its experiences working with the user community ,  Lego has developed  set of principles that summarize what it has learned about collaborating and interacting with knowledgeable users 


-  Fans complained about being asked to consider cost and complexity when developing their designs and to adhere to building techniques that met the companys tight quality and safety standards 


-  In collaborating with very engaged and skilled users who were contributing their ideas ,  it was easy for the company to focus on getting the job done ,  forgetting that the users had needs that sometimes diverged from those of Lego employees and that the collaborations themselves needed to be rewarding experiences for the users 


-  Developing  win-win mind-set must be  priority 


-  In business partnerships between Lego and users  ( for example ,  in cases such as the architecture project and the sensors )  ,  various long-term ,  fee-based partnership agreements have been negotiated 


-  Lego employees involved with the user community learned early in the process that while participants were indeed committed to the Lego brand and the Lego brick ,  they were also attracted to the sense of community they experienced with other adult fans 


-  If  design receives 10 , 000 votes ,  Lego agrees to consider it for possible production; if the design is commercialized ,  innovators receive 1% of the total net sales for their product 


-  To protect confidential and proprietary information ,  companies customarily ask collaborators to sign nondisclosure agreements 


-  Lego also attempts to maintain transparency in all matters related to collaboration 


-  ,  Cumulatively ,  the principles we have discussed here help Lego organize collaborations with users in  manner that balances the needs of the company with those of its users 


-  Instead of regarding collaboration as something that needs to be managed exclusively by the company ,  it is fruitful to think of it as an ongoing dialogue between two allies
