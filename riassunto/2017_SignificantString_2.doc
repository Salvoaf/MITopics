-  ,  So ,  whats the main thing for us? We are here to provide care when people need it and to help them maintain their health 


-   know ,  from walking through our medical centers  lot and from experiencing  near-death experience myself  decade ago ,  it is at the front lines where people really understand our mission ,  because they live it every day 


-   dont need to remind  nurse or doctor that we are here to improve health and save lives 


-  Wherever in the organization we are hiring ,  we need to ask if the employees personal mission in life aligns with the mission of the organization 


-  ,  TYSON: They are tested when external forces raise questions that the organization needs to address 


-  It prompted me to send  message across the organization making sure everyone was clear that we will continue to stand for equal access and care for everyone ,  and that no one will feel that theyre being scrutinized if they need care from Kaiser Permanente 


-  ,  Now  know ,  even without my message ,  we wouldnt have had  single problem with someone being questioned for care ,  or denied care ,  or anything like that 


-  But it was an opportunity to reaffirm what we stand for ,  to reinforce what people throughout the organization already know about our values ,  and to remind them that they are  part of it 


-  And there is real satisfaction that comes from the thousands of responses to the message ,  saying ,  Thank you for just saying that 


-  Leaders are required to distill the complexities of all the forces ,  some of which are beyond their control ,  and then to guide the organization in making sense out of them and delivering on the value proposition ,  which requires executing on strategies within all this complexity 


-  ,  The days of  hierarchical leader being the know-all ,  the understand-all ,  and the be-all individual makes no sense in todays environment 


-  ,   would argue that ,  in simplistic terms ,  the old model was [that] those in management were the thinkers ,  and the rest of the workers were the doers 


-  Now we live in  day and age where everybody gets to think and do 


-   want the frontline nurse ,  who has access to the same information  do ,  to act on the information pertaining to his or her profession and ,  with that access and freedom ,  come up with new ideas and new ways of getting work done 


-   think of it as very organized chaos ,  if anything 


-  All the incentives and resources need to be aligned to that 


-  ,  As Im talking to you right now ,   medical team is likely attending to someone with  near-death experience in one of our emergency departments 


-  Its to make sure they have the tools ,  the equipment ,  the know-how ,  and the decision power to make the right judgment when called upon ,  in the interest of the person whom they are serving 


-  ,  In an organization like Kaiser Permanente ,  where knowledge ,  technology ,  and skills are in the hands of thousands of capable individuals who are making millions of microdecisions ,   CEO would be foolish to think he or she controls those decisions 


-  ,  TYSON: Yes ,   think middle managers are in one of the most difficult positions 


-  Theyre feeling the push of the frontline caregiver saying ,  I need more resources to do the things  need to do for our members 


-  And the people above them are saying ,  Are you within your budget? Have you justified what you need? ,  Managers in the middle of the organization are dealing with both dynamics simultaneously 


-   know what its like to try to sort through the demands of both worlds 


-  ,  Then theres the fact that many managers got to where they are because they did the technical stuff right 


-  ,  When the primary job of  manager was to make sure the workforce had what it needed and did what it needed ,  these technical skills usually transferred pretty well 


-  ,  In some cases ,  middle managers need to unlearn old things to learn new things ,  and part of our evolution is addressing how we continue to reeducate our people 


-  ,  TYSON: Not necessarily ,  but it has prompted us to rethink our whole training and education program and how we support managers to be successful 


-  Across the country ,  these employees shared why they want to work at Kaiser Permanente  and also what makes it challenging 


-  ,  From those discussions ,  they created something called Stretch@KP ,  which offers millennial employees opportunities to take on projects outside their core areas of responsibility 


-  Were learning how millennials think ,  how they behave ,  what they expect in the work environment ,  just as theyre learning from us 


-  They were being very clear about whats important to them: I dont want to be stuck in one job 


-  Its  give-and-take relationship 


-  The last thing  want is for individuals who exercise freedom of speech throughout the rest of their lives to feel any different about the freedom to speak inside the organization 


-  ,  We are working on creating an environment where everybody feels they have the right and the obligation to speak their truth: This is what  witnessed 


-  This is how Im feeling 


-   want the best thinking brought forward 


-   want all the different views to be on the table 


-   want debate and people discussing options 


-  ,  In senior management meetings ,  when one of my executives feels strongly about an issue and they want to take me on ,  sometimes theyll ask ,  Freedom of speech? And Ill say ,  Yes 


-  And then theyll come with it: I think youre dead wrong 


-  They just simply put the code out there: Freedom of speech? ,  Now our management needs to continue to get comfortable that freedom of speech exists everywhere in the organization 


-   think the organization ,  just like this country ,  is not owned by any individual 


-  You take  hard position on something ,  which you have the right to do 


-  Well ,  there may be some people who feel just as passionately that thats not the right position 


-  You need to be prepared for that 


-  And when its working ,  it feels nonjudgmental 


-  Its about creating  culture where  nurse can walk in and say ,  Ive been thinking about something 


-  What if we did this process  ,   ,   ,   instead of  ,   ,   ,  4? And the natural response from whomever she is addressing is ,  Oh yeah? Lets flesh that out and see where we want to go 


-  Maybe itll get adopted and maybe it wont ,  but it will be considered 


-  No one should think twice about sharing their opinion ,  because they know freedom of speech is embedded in our culture 


-  ,  Its the role of management to take all the various perspectives and ideas into consideration before making  final decision and ensure everyone knows they have been heard in that process 


-   think it depends on what kind of collective environment were going to create 


-  We need policy makers ,  tech leaders ,  influencers ,  and others to come together to think through the ethical and moral issues technology poses 


-  There are still fundamental issues that need to be addressed in order for the health care industry to tap the power and potential of technology to deliver better health to everyone ,  regardless of race ,  economics ,  or geography 


-  ,  How do we get people to see the big picture when thinking about health and questions of affordability and access to care?  would argue that  big-picture perspective to health is what has been missing from our current health care system ,  which was designed around the fix me model ,  where people came to  doctors office or  hospital only when they were sick 


-  ,  Kaiser Permanente has always focused on prevention ,  and now we are thinking about how we can influence health and behaviors even earlier  and not just the health of our 11 


-  We know that medical care is only  small ,  but critically important ,  percentage of what determines good health ,  so we are looking deep into our communities to develop partnerships with schools ,  local governments ,  and businesses to influence the things that create health in the first place  such as jobs ,  education ,  public safety ,  environmental health ,  etc 


-   think this is the evolution of health care
