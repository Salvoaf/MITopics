- We live and work in an age when the need for corporate reinvention is treated almost as  given 


-  Countless CEOs talk about reducing hierarchy and increasing agility ,  flexibility ,  and connectedness to the market ,  and virtually every large company is transforming for digital 


-  Yet in most organizations ,  lip service to change remains more the order of the day than real change itself 


-  ,  Then again ,  you might work with Zhang Ruimin 


-  ,  based in Qingdao ,  China ,  has done what most chief executives dare not even dream about 


-  He blew up much of the administrative structure of  global manufacturing enterprise ,  eliminating 10 , 000 management jobs that once held it together 


-  And he has guided the organization to reemerge as  network of entrepreneurial ventures run by employees ,  whose compensation is based on the success of their products in the market 


-  ,  In its transformed state ,  Haier is no longer  traditional manufacturer corporation so much as  platform that provides financing ,  support ,  and coordination for microenterprises all focused on developing products and services for the smart home ,  the internet of things  ( IoT ) -based concept of  fully connected and networked household 


-  ,  Haier calls its management model Rendanheyi ,   term that refers to connecting employees with users 


-  The company sees it as  win-win model for reducing the distance between the organization and its end users to zero and moving as close as possible to  state of co-creation with the customer 


-  ,  This isnt the first organizational innovation Ruimin has led at Haier during his three decades with the company ,  but it is certainly the most profound 


-  In noting the honor ,  Jeffrey Sonnenfeld ,   senior associate dean of leadership programs at Yale ,  called Ruimin a genuine global business giant who inspires mythic awe in his competitors ,  his peers ,  and his fellow Chinese business leaders 


-  The interview was conducted through  translator ,  and  further exchange took place via email 


-  ,  Two things make us believe now is the time 


-  One is the internet ,  and the other is the internet of things 


-  The internet has closed the distance between parts of the organization and between the organization and its customers to zero 


-  This means that traditional management models  like Taylorism and bureaucracy as proposed by Max Weber  are no longer relevant 


-  Then there is the internet of things ,  which represents the next generation of the internet 


-  Despite  dozen years of development ,  the idea of IoT has not taken off  or as we like to say ,  it has not been ignited 


-  ,  We looked at this question from two different angles 


-  Weve talked to many corporations in the hope of finding  management model from which we can learn 


-  ,  Secondly ,  whats called for in the IoT age? Its  direct interaction with users and  focus on creating the best user experience 


-  However ,  in the traditional economy ,  there are no users ,  there are only customers 


-  ,  Why hasnt IoT been ignited? Because an interactive platform for users  where companies can take direction from the people who will buy their products  has yet to be created 


-  We need to establish  community economy with zero distance between customers and companies 


-  Our end goal is to have  true connection with our users and to create legitimate lifetime value for them via the internet of things 


-  ,  The platform is the only place for  business to go to 


-  By eradicating our middle management layer  and laying off more than 10 , 000 middle-level managers  we have destroyed the original hierarchical structure 


-  All the businesses have to succeed as innovative entrepreneurial enterprises ,  or they will be kicked off the platform 


-  The platform is also accessible to entrepreneurial projects from outside Haier 


-  ,  Three things 


-  This was totally unimaginable back in 2005 ,  when the idea for this strategic transformation was proposed 


-  ,  The second thing is the variety of markets the entrepreneurial teams can enter 


-  For example ,  our gaming laptop has grown to become the No 


-   market player in China in the short span of two to three years since the laptop team became entrepreneurial 


-  ,  But what has surprised me most is that employees have accepted the radical compensation change 


-  Previously ,  we used IBMs broadbanding model ,  where pay was determined based on an employees position and contribution 


-  If someone can meet the requirements  if they can help start up  business  then they will prosper on the platform 


-  ,  At the same time ,  we have external IoT entrepreneurs joining our platform because they believe it offers resources and support that other platforms do not 


-  We have developed  networked organization that attracts the most capable people 


-  ,  What we do is help people form communities of interest so that they can work together as entrepreneurs 


-  For instance ,  someone comes up with an idea for  product targeting  certain niche of the market 


-  And then people from different departments or disciplines  research and development [R&D] ,  sales ,  manufacturing ,  marketing  will sit down and analyze its viability across all the relevant dimensions 


-  ,  We also have microenterprises that focus on more cutting-edge projects 


-  For example ,  at  certain point of this endeavor ,  they must be able to attract external venture capital 


-  If they cant achieve the investment by an agreed-upon time ,  then they have to let it [the project] go ,  or we might invite another entrepreneurial team to work on the project 


-  ,   think most business leaders tend to view their employees as passive performers who take orders from their superiors 


-  According to traditional management philosophy ,  there are managers and those to be managed 


-  ,  The reason why  companys employees are not leaders is that they have not had the soil or platform to grow upon 


-  ,  In our model we have delegated the major powers of corporate executives to the employees  or at least to the microenterprises  including the power of decision-making ,  the power of selecting and appointing personnel ,  and the power of financial allocation 


-  ,  Thats  very important question ,  and one of our biggest challenges 


-  Its true that manufacturing workers do not typically face the market directly ,  but we can create  connection to the market by allowing our different production lines to compete with one another 


-  ,  We have 108 factories all around the world ,  each possessing many production lines; every production line is  microenterprise 


-  We evaluate the performance of these microenterprises based on cost ,  delivery and service quality ,  and market response to the products they make 


-  Some production lines are able to acquire many orders 


-  In this way the production lines are organically connected with the market 


-  ,  Moving forward ,  we are forging an even tighter connection by allowing users to work directly with the factory to place ,  customize ,  monitor ,  and take delivery straight from the production line 


-  ,  This is  question we are constantly reflecting upon ,  and it guides our direction 


-  Though we have turned Haier into an entrepreneurial platform ,  we are not an investment company 


-  The goal of an investment company is to put in money and take out profit 


-  ,  Our primary aim is to ignite the internet of things 


-  All the entrepreneurial teams on the platform  even though they cross industries  focus on the smart home in some way 


-  This is also why so many teams outside of Haier are willing to start up smart-home businesses on our platform 


-  On Haiers platform ,  businesses gain access to our sales network ,  logistics operation ,  and R&D system 


-  Haiers platform offers the help to IoT businesses that other platforms or funds cannot 


-  ,  Whats most important is our resolute aim to be the enterprise that can truly ignite the whole idea of IoT 


-  And this requires evolving from stand-alone products to products connected to the internet and on to  network of products and services all connected to each other 


-  ,  So ,  what has become of the electric refrigerator in this scenario? It has transformed from  single appliance into the hub of  network connected to 400 organic food suppliers that monitor inventory levels and keep the refrigerator stocked 


-  This model  and this level of interconnectedness  is really difficult to achieve in terms of both technology and business 


-  When youre taking into account this kind of transformation ,   true ignition for IoT becomes very hard to reach 


-  When it comes to business ,  Chinese companies basically replicate Western management 


-  So ,  its not as difficult for us to disrupt the model because its not Chinese in the first place 


-  In  typical Western company ,  activities are siloed by departments and then further cut up into more detailed tasks 


-  ,  In China ,  we tend to look at things from the holistic perspective 


-  If something is wrong with your stomach ,  then something is wrong with your stomach 


-  ,  So we are applying this traditional holistic thinking to our management transformation 


-  The internet and IoT require enterprises to see things from the whole and systemic perspectives and to stop dividing everything into tiny parts 


-  We are  global business and must be able to globalize Rendanheyi 


-  We acquired  consumer appliance business from Sanyo Electric Co 


-  So its working ,  although at present [it is] applied only in the Asia-Pacific region 


-  Its  very large American company with  standard linear management model ,  where every action has  basis 


-  Rendanheyi is  nonlinear management model in which employees must be able to answer the question ,  What do  do next? for themselves 


-  There is no one for you to ask  and thats  challenging transformation 


-  When most companies achieve success ,  they tend to fall into states of self-satisfaction and complacence ,  celebrating and falling in love with their achievements 


-  Even when we have  great success ,  we question where we can improve 


-  Because we have  DNA of self-negation ,  it is easier for us to disrupt ourselves and to accept the need for change 


-  We keep saying internally to our employees that theres no such thing as  successful business 


-  Theres only  business that is compatible with the task at hand 


-  Youre just doing the right thing at the right time 


-  Things change all the time 


-  The only thing that doesnt change is time itself 


-  So ,  if you dont keep up with changes ,  youll be quickly made obsolete 


-  ,  ( Laughing )  This question has been raised by many people 


-  Ive been working at Haier for more than 30 years ,  but even if  can keep working and keep leading the organization ,  it doesnt guarantee future success 


-  My task is not to cultivate  replacement but to cultivate many people who are willing to challenge both themselves and the status quo 


-  Rather than listening to my orders ,  my instructions  which might turn out to be erroneous  our teams follow the demands of the market and of our users 


-  ,  Nowadays ,  the management model in many enterprises is empowerment ,  but we are not empowering; we are returning all the power to the employees
