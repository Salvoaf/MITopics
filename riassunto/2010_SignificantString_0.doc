-  ,  Like most disasters ,  many factors contributed to Cerro Grande 


-  But what happens when small fires start to accumulate ,  grow or change direction? The fact is that when were in the middle of the action ,  we often get so engrossed in what were doing we dont notice that things have changed ,  or we ignore signals suggesting we should alter our course 


-  ,  Momentum can become dysfunctional for at least five reasons: ,   


-  But when people are under pressure to perform and produce ,  the last thing they want is someone pointing out irksome problems that imply things may be going awry 


-  Moreover ,  managers may feel that they dont have the time to stop ,  reconsider ,  reevaluate and slow things down  that they just cant afford to waffle 


-  We evaluate people ,  processes and outcomes against plans rather than reevaluate the plans themselves 


-  We have only to consider the Big Three  


-  In fact ,  even when the environment is stable ,  seemingly insignificant actions occurring in the normal process of running  business can cause ripples throughout the system ,  requiring adjustments in the course of action 


-  People tend to treat information that invalidates what they expect either as no big deal or as something to inject into existing beliefs 


-  Deference to perceived expertise 


-  However ,  even when fear is absent ,  some people defer to experience because they equate it with expertise; they believe that their more experienced colleague must know whats best 


-  Bernard Madoff himself recently theorized that one reason why Securities and Exchange Commission staff members did not closely examine his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme was because of his stature in the industry 


-  But even assuming honesty and the best of intentions ,  just because someone is experienced does not mean that he is an expert in the current situation 


-  Moreover ,  when situations are dynamic and complex ,  it is unlikely that any one person can hold all the necessary knowledge for managing that situation ,  however sterling his qualifications may be 


-  Our reasoning came from  large body of research on organizational crises suggesting that many disasters result from failures of foresight  from the accumulation of unnoticed sets of events 


-  Yet the predominant pattern of evidence confounded our expectations 


-  ,  It was more often the case that firefighters were so engrossed in the unfolding situation that they failed to stop and absorb the new  and observed  cues into their understanding of what was happening and how to deal with it 


-  What became clear from our data is that dysfunctional momentum is not necessarily  problem of failing to sense important signals but of interpreting and incorporating the cues that are sensed 


-  In order to overcome the momentum ,  we have to create interruptions  points at which we can ask: Whats the story now? Is it the same story as before? If not ,  how has it changed? And how ,  if at all ,  should we adjust our actions? ,  That reevaluation process may sound reasonable in theory ,  but in practice it rarely occurs 


-  In fact ,  our respondents reported many instances in which they or members of their crew had seen information that signaled dangerous conditions or potential problems but that did not lead them to reevaluate their approach 


-  ,  We have found that in order to overcome dysfunctional momentum you need to do the one thing you are least likely to want to do in the middle of  crisis 


-  But our study suggests that  lack of interruptions may in fact pose  threat to companies abilities to make sense of  growing problem ,  update their understanding of its circumstances and ,  if appropriate ,  change the course of action 


-  In such cases ,  when wheels are set in motion to prevent or reduce the dysfunctional momentum that would hinder the redirection ,  two factors tend to be instrumental 


-  First ,  individuals have to recognize their own inability to understand fully and predict the unfolding situation by themselves  they have to develop what we call situated humility 


-  Second ,  they must actively create or seek out disruptive information  they have to accept interruptions so that people may reevaluate the story they are maintaining in their minds 


-  ,  Situated humility arises not out of personal insecurity but rather from the acceptance that ,  however confident one is in his own skills and abilities ,  the situation is so dynamic ,  complex and uncertain that no individual can be fully knowledgeable under the circumstances 


-  ,  Successful firefighters believe that fire is so unpredictable ,  so inherently unmanageable ,  that it can never be fully understood 


-  The perspective appears to reflect what social psychologist Karl Weick refers to as an attitude of wisdom  the knowledge that one does not fully understand what is happening because he or she has never seen precisely this event before 


-  Any good manager recognizes the importance of encouraging employees to speak up about problems or concerns 


-  More than simply transmitting data ,  when people express their concerns aloud they create  kind of shared artifact 


-  The statement is now out there ,  hanging in the air ,  and must now be addressed  acknowledged ,  acted on or perhaps dismissed ,  but in any case attended to 


-  In that way ,  the statement creates an interruption in the way of thinking about the situation 


-  By voicing  concern ,  someone is basically asking ,  What do we now believe is going on? ,  One firefighter recalled working on  fire that seemed to be becoming especially active 


-  Recalling the incident later ,  our respondent said it was as if his boss had been waiting for somebody to say something 


-  No new information was passed on ,  but by giving voice to what everyone saw ,  he disrupted the momentum of their ongoing actions and gave his boss and the crew the pause they needed to reevaluate 


-  The most common reason for that ,  however ,  was not what we might have expected 


-  Rather ,  individuals often refrained from mentioning indicators of potential problems because they assumed that more expert firefighters had already noticed and evaluated those indicators 


-  Yet because she had little familiarity with that particular kind of terrain ,  and because the team leader was  veteran of the force with many years of experience ,  our respondent assumed she couldnt possibly know something that he didnt and therefore said nothing 


-  When recalling the event ,  the trainee acknowledged his bosss experience level but realized that in this instance he knew the burn plan better; and often ,  just because of where he was physically located near the fire ,  he had more information about what was happening 


-  Recognizing that fact allowed him to speak up and interrupt what could have become dysfunctional momentum and  disastrous outcome 


-  When people ,  especially leaders ,  seek out  range of perspectives ,  they are actively interrupting their own thought processes and actions ,  thereby creating space to reevaluate the situation and potentially take different and more effective actions 


-  ,  Perspectives can vary by level of expertise ,  by physical position with respect to the fire or simply by personal interpretation of what is happening 


-  ,  Another respondent emphasized the importance of looking at the fire from the air ,  from the ground ,  by using maps and by frequently contacting team members working on different parts of the fire 


-  By drawing on all these perspectives ,  he said ,  it was possible to create  more comprehensive understanding of the fire 


-  In fact ,  one safety officer suggested that he could evaluate the safety of the overall operation simply by watching leaders to see how well they maintained contact with their crews 


-  They dont want to be interrupted 


-  But that can also mean avoiding critical opportunities to stop and ask ,  Whats the story now? Interruptions force us to reconsider whether we really know what is going on and how well the present actions are working 


-  Ask yourself: How might the future differ from our expectations? How might changes or problems in one part of the business unexpectedly affect other parts? What parts of the situation cant we see? Try to create healthy skepticism about what you know and  greater awareness of what you dont know 


- 10 More generally ,  it is important that everyones voice be heard and that participants ,  in presenting their own points of view ,  avoid trying to argue so strenuously that they fail to listen respectfully and attentively to what others have to say 


-  Giving voice to what you are observing and thinking helps reveal your assumptions ,  allowing you and others to revise them if necessary 


-  Also ,  when you inquire publicly ,  that helps people to understand what is going on and provides  model for them to emulate 


- 11 With more and richer communication ,  it is possible to maintain  more nuanced and complex understanding of the situation 


-  Members of diverse groups should be encouraged to share the unique knowledge they each hold and not limit themselves to the information they have in common
