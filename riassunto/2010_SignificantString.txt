- Every day consumers make purchase decisions by choosing among large sets of related products available for sale in the aisles of stores 


-  What factors might systematically affect how consumers make decisions among an array of products? Our research explores one aspect of that question 


-  ,  As most marketers realize ,  not all shoppers are created equal 


-  Within the same store ,  one may be searching for  specific product to meet an immediate need ,  while others may simply be browsing 


-  Just as they can have different goals when they enter  store ,  individual consumers may approach purchase decisions with different mindsets that can affect how they shop 


-  In social psychology ,   mindset is defined as  set of cognitive processes and judgmental criteria that ,  once activated ,  can carry over to unrelated tasks and decisions 


-  In other words ,  if you get  consumer thinking  certain way ,  that way of thinking  that mindset  can influence his or her subsequent shopping behavior 


-  ,  In particular ,  social psychologists have identified two distinct mindsets that are relevant to how consumers make decisions when choosing among large sets of related products: abstract and concrete 


-  An abstract mindset encourages people to think in  more broad and general way 


-  Consumers in an abstract mindset who face an array of related products will focus more on the shared product attributes associated with an overarching purpose  for example ,  the general category of hair care or car maintenance 


-  Conversely ,   concrete mindset draws attention to lower-level details and attributes associated with execution or usage; consumers in  concrete mindset will thus focus on factors that differentiate between products 


-  ,  In our research ,  we examined how abstract versus concrete mindsets affected consumers purchase decisions 


-  ( The research results are described in detail in  working paper called The Role of Abstract and Concrete Mindsets on the Purchase of Products from Adjacent Categories 


-  )  In  series of experiments ,  we found that mindset matters 


-  When consumers must decide whether or not to make purchases from  variety of related but different product categories  such as toothpaste ,  mouthwash and dental floss in an array of oral care products  an abstract mindset increases the number of products consumers select 


-  But the reverse occurs when consumers choose among products that are similar enough that consumers could substitute one for another  such as  variety of beverages 


-  In those cases ,   concrete mindset increases the number of products consumers want to buy 


-  ,  In the experiments ,  we first used exercises that prior research has suggested should help establish an abstract or  concrete mindset  such as asking some participants to write about  year from now  ( an assignment likely to induce an abstract mindset )  while others were asked to write about tomorrow  ( which is likely to induce  concrete mindset )  


-  We then compared the purchase intent  and in some experiments ,  actual purchases  of consumers in an abstract versus concrete mindset 


-  We found that it is not  question of one mindset being better than the other at increasing consumers likelihood of purchase 


-  Instead ,  the effect of concrete and abstract mindsets varied with the type of product arrays from which consumers were choosing 


-  ,  Specifically ,  when faced with  choice among different types of products that relate to the same overarching goal  for example ,  the various kinds of products available in the oral care aisle  having an abstract mindset ,  rather than  concrete one ,  increased the number of products purchased 


-  This presumably occurred because an abstract mindset draws attention to the higher-level purpose  in this case ,  oral care  which in turn increased consumers interest in all means serving that goal  toothbrush ,  floss ,  etc 


-   and thereby increased the total number of products consumers wanted to purchase 


-  ,  However ,  when consumers chose among products that were similar enough to be substituted for one another  such as an array of beverages  an abstract mindset decreased interest in purchasing additional products when compared to  concrete mindset 


-  That is because an abstract mindset leads to  focus on the higher-level goal  such as satisfying ones thirst  and ,  presumably ,  to the fact that one beverage is sufficient to satisfy that abstract goal 


-  Conversely ,  consumers with  concrete mindset focused on the differentiating factors between products  and were thus likely to select  greater number of substitutable products than their abstract-focused counterparts did 


-  ,  These findings have two clear and straightforward implications for managers: To increase sales ,  companies should consider matching or manipulating the mindset of the consumer 


-  ,  Matching the Mindset 


-  The nature of the retailer or the types of products offered may naturally promote  more abstract or concrete mindset upon which businesses can capitalize 


-  In some cases ,  consumers may tend to approach  retailer planning to make purchases for distant future use; for example ,  consumers may be evaluating furniture that will be delivered in  number of weeks 


-  The literature on abstract versus concrete mindsets suggests that when consumers consider products for distant future use ,  they may naturally be in  more abstract mindset than consumers who are evaluating products for immediate consumption 


-  Our research suggests that retailers who recognize that their products may promote distant future considerations  ( and thus  more abstract mindset )  may increase sales if they organize their product offerings in  way that highlights their products relationship to  common higher-order goal 


-  For example ,   furniture retailer might group products in  way that showcases how different types of furniture all share the benefit of adding comfort and warmth 


-  Conversely ,  for retailers such as snack vendors who recognize that their products promote fairly immediate use and hence  more concrete mindset ,  grouping similar ,  substitutable snack products together should help maximize consumers purchase rates 


-  ,  Manipulating the Mindset 


-  While matching the mindset may be an effective strategy for retailers whose goods naturally promote  distinct mindset ,  for many retailers the variety of products they offer is such that no clear mindset predominates 


-  For these retailers ,  manipulating consumers mindset as they view specific sets of products may be one effective way to increase purchase rates 


-  ,  Imagine  retailer offering  large set of related but different products in an oral care aisle 


-  Our findings suggest that ,  to increase sales ,  that retailer should consider promoting  more abstract mindset as consumers make their product considerations 


-  For example ,  managers could implement promotions highlighting the individual products relatedness to the overarching ,  higher-level purpose  (  


-  ,  oral care ,  as opposed to simply clean teeth )  in order to increase consumers propensity to purchase more types of oral-care products 


-  Conversely ,  for  retailer offering  large set of substitutable products ,  such as drinks in  beverage aisle ,  the opposite suggestion holds 


-  In-store communications promoting  more concrete mindset  by stressing the individual and unique benefits of various products  could be used to increase total sales 


-  ,  While we believe our work suggests important practical implications for retailers ,  future research is necessary to fully explore and understand the observed effects 


-  We hope that the current research will prompt future inquiry into this area 


- As managers become more comfortable with including blogs and social networks as part of their integrated marketing communications ,  they have naturally turned their attention to questions regarding the return on investment of social media 


-  Clearly ,  there is no shortage of interest in the topic 


-   quick Google search recently for ROI social media returned over  


-  Internet marketing and online retailing conferences now devote attention to ROI issues ,  and managers are asking themselves every day ,  Whats the ROI of [substitute social media application here]? Blog posts ,  white papers and case studies prepared by social media gurus ,  consultants and industry analysts abound ,  yet the answer remains largely unsatisfying 


-  ,  We understand the pressures and the desire to quantify the return generated by investing in social media ,  but we believe most marketers are approaching the issue the wrong way 


-  ,  Effective social media measurement should start by turning the traditional ROI approach on its head 


-  That is ,  instead of emphasizing their own marketing investments and calculating the returns in terms of customer response ,  managers should begin by considering consumer motivations to use social media and then measure the social media investments customers make as they engage with the marketers brands 


-  ,  Handling the measurements this way makes much more sense 


-  It takes into account not only short-term goals such as increasing sales in the next month via  social media marketing campaign or reducing costs next quarter due to more responsive online support forums ,  but also the long-term returns of significant corporate investment in social media 


-  ,  We will explain our reasoning in detail and suggest some guidelines for better integrating social media into your overall marketing strategy ,  but first  quick example of the kind of radical rethinking we believe is called for 


-  ,  In calculating social media ROI ,  most marketers start by measuring the cost of launching  blog ,  for example ,  and then seek to calculate the return on sales ,  say ,  from that social media investment 


-  But  company could also start by thinking about what marketing objectives such  blog might satisfy  (  


-  ,  to learn about new products )  and what behaviors they might engage in once they got there  (  


-  ,  post  comment about  recent consumption experience )  that could be linked to the companys marketing objectives 


-  This suggests that returns from social media investments will not always be measured in dollars ,  but also in customer behaviors  ( consumer investments )  tied to particular social media applications 


-  Consumer investments include obvious measures such as the number of visits and time spent with the application  ( the blog in this case )  as well as more active investments ,  such as the valence of blog comments and the number of Facebook updates and Twitter pages about the brand 


-  These investments can then be used to measure key marketing outcomes such as changes in awareness levels or word-of-mouth increases over time 


-  ,  Although what we are proposing might seem radical ,  we believe you have no choice 


-  ,  Traditional media measurement seems almost quaint in todays dynamic and increasingly complex media environment 


-  Marketers are struggling with social media measurement partly because the frameworks are still largely driven by reach and frequency and are ill-suited to the interactive media environment 


-  ,  On one side are the managers in the trenches whose experience and gut feelings tell them that social media are important ,  even as they struggle with how to quantify this 


-  On the other side is top management ,  who may not be 100% convinced about the value of social media or fully understand them  and even if they get it in principle ,  they still want to see the numbers 


-  This tension explains the constant questioning about ROI in emerging advertising media like Twitter 


-  ,  While managers certainly need hard numbers to know whether their investments are paying off ,  they represent  narrow show me the return focus rooted in  traditional mainstream media 


-  First ,  it is oriented to the short term  ( show me how my companys tweets will improve sales next quarter )  


-  Developing meaningful relationships with customers takes time because online relationships involve interactive conversations ,  and some managers still do not fully appreciate that they are entering  brave new world of relationships with customers 


-  ,  This is  world in which customers are fully in control of their online experiences and where their motivations lead them to connect online with other consumers while they create and consume online content ,  much of it user- rather than marketer-generated 


-  These four key motivations  connections ,  creation ,  consumption and control  drive consumer use of social media 


-  This 4cs perspective is important because it leads to  consumer-oriented framework for evaluating social media 


-  ,  Both these things call for  different way of thinking about how to measure social media 


-  Most managers feel pressure to emphasize traditional objectives such as direct sales ,  direct cost reductions or increases in market share from social media 


-  And  marketer who wants to know the immediate effect on sales of  particular social media campaign can do so relatively easily by tracking the revenue generated from the dollars spent ,  even if tying social media actions directly to sales is difficult 


-  It is becoming increasingly obvious that social media can lead to real cost savings ,  such as when customers serve as their own version of  companys toll-free help desk through FAQs on user forums 


-  It is also clear that social media can improve the efficiency of market research efforts when ,  for example ,  marketers set up online prediction markets to crowdsource new ideas or mine online forums that allow customers to comment on product concepts and offer improvements for existing products 


-  ,  Sales ,  cost efficiencies ,  product development and market research are obvious objectives ,  but in our development of appropriate social media metrics we want to emphasize objectives that take advantage of the distinctive characteristics of social media 


-  In the social media environment ,  marketers have unique opportunities to develop social media programs that tackle awareness ,  engagement and word-of-mouth objectives 


-  Social media applications can fulfill any of these objectives ,  where the appropriate set of metrics depends on the objective 


-  )  ,  To get an ROI estimate ,  managers would link the social media metrics to an additional set of proxy benchmarks  (  


-  ,  the likelihood of future purchase by  user engaged with the companys brand through  specific social media application ,  or the reach of  specific word-of-mouth element and subsequent conversion to future sales )  


-  For example ,   popular personal care brand ran  large-scale integrated ad campaign on MySpace in the second quarter of 2008 and used matched consumer panels to link online social media behavior to survey measures of purchase intent as well as actual in-store sales 


-  The results showed an ROI of 28% for the ad campaign 


-  ,  As this example shows ,  companies are starting to see some success measuring the ROI of their social media experiments ,  including some that offer the consumer  relatively complex social media experience 


-  For example ,  in 2007 ,  Kellogg created an integrated digital media experience for the Special  Challenge featuring  support website that offered consumers the opportunity to customize  diet using Special  cereal ,  participate in online forums with pointers from experts ,  join  Yahoo! e-mail support group and click through to Amazon 


- com to purchase the cereal 


-  Vocalpoint ,  Procter  Gambles social networking site ,  has over 350 , 000 members who talk about P&G products; by linking these customer investments in brand conversation to sales ,  the site is credited with market response increases of up to 30% 


-  ,  To be sure ,  there is some complexity involved in calculating the ROI of  sophisticated social media campaign ,  not necessarily limited to determining the size of the test and control samples and the ability to match online customer profiles with offline purchases 


-  However ,  even small-scale social media efforts can benefit from plugging in segment-level estimates and proxy measures to quantify how the customer investments from brand awareness ,  brand engagement and word of mouth affect the purchase decision funnel and ,  ultimately ,  the bottom line 


-  We expect that over time the number and quality of the necessary inputs will increase ,  but marketers can find even rough proxy estimates useful in the meantime to generate the calculations necessary to link marketing investments to customer investments and market response 


-  ,  Below we discuss three social media objectives and provide several examples of each 


-  Online ,  however ,  marketers have  number of ways to track brand awareness 


-  ,  In the social media environment ,  every time  person uses an application designed by or about the company ,  the company gains increased exposure to its brand ,  often in highly relevant contexts 


-  For example ,  several days before Election Day 2008 ,  Starbucks ran  spot on the Saturday Night Live show as well as on YouTube ,  promoting  free coffee giveaway 


-  Twitter mentions of Starbucks skyrocketed ,  averaging  mention every eight seconds ,  which translated into  sizeable increase in brand exposure 


-  Such usages enhance and strengthen associations of the brand in customers minds through increased exposures 


-  ,  Another example is Naked Pizza ,   New Orleans ,  Louisiana-based business catering to health-conscious pizza lovers ,  which tweeted about its pizzas in 2009 and successfully drew around  , 000 followers in just  few months 


-  The company also kept track of sales that were spurred by  billboard outside its shop encouraging customers to follow it on Twitter 


-  The microblogging campaigns success culminated in the company breaking its one-day sales record ,  with more than 68% of its sales coming from customers who were Twitter followers 


-  Also on that day ,  85% of the companys new customers claimed they had been motivated to buy from Naked Pizza because of Twitter 


-  ,  Finally ,  in what have rapidly become classics in the social media sphere ,  K-Tecs blender brand Blendtec posted  series of humorous demonstration videos in which the companys founder ,  Tom Dickson ,  posed the question Will it Blend? and then proceeded to blend iPhones ,  glow sticks ,  golf balls and many other products previously thought unblendable using his line of hardy blenders 


-  The Will It Blend? campaign quickly went viral and as  result saw its sales grow fivefold 


-  ,  Brand engagement can be enhanced through social media in various ways ,  and the results can be strikingly positive 


-  Visits to the new and improved blog rose by 25% ,  page views increased 40% and visitors stayed 26% longer on the companys website 


-  The blog engaged customers on touchy subjects like assigned seating and used the results from 700 posts as  virtual focus group 


-  On their own ,  thousands of members generated significant buzz with regular posts ,  which in turn motivated numerous others to join and participate on the networking site 


-   Facebook application called Circle of Moms  which let mothers post messages ,  arrange carpools ,  set up back-to-school checklists and click through to promotions on the Target site  generated more than 20 , 000 visitors in six weeks 


-  ,  These highly engaging social media campaigns involving user-generated content likely generate commitment on the part of the consumer ,  reinforcing loyalty to the brand and making the customer more likely to commit additional effort to support the brand in the future 


-  The bottom-line rewards for this kind of engagement may be observed through delayed sales 


-  Online ,  marketers can use one-time versus repeated interactions or active participation compared to passive consumption of social media as proxy measures 


-  Satisfied and loyal consumers communicate their positive attitudes toward the brand itself or toward the social application created by the company  ( be it  Facebook application or group ,   Twitter presence ,   blog or  YouTube video )  to new ,  prospective customers both online and offline 


-  Dissatisfied and disgruntled customers may also share their negative attitudes toward the brand or poor social applications ,  as when technology journalist Jeff Jarvis blogged in 2005 about the shoddy customer service he received from Dell  his own Dell Hell that spread like wildfire on the Internet and mainstream media  and Dell saw its customer satisfaction score drop five points in one year 


- 10 On the positive side ,  Japanese gaming company Square Enix started an online community to stir up interest in its North American release of Sonys Playstation  video game Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King 


-  The North American online community was  success ,  drawing more than 14 , 000 members to join its forum ,  with 30% recruited via word of mouth from existing members; 40% of the online community pre-ordered the game 


-  Though later pulled ,  the reverse word-of-mouth campaign resulted in members unfriending  total of 234 , 000 Facebook friends 


-  These abandoned friends monitored by the application received alerts informing them that they had been sacrificed for  Whopper 


-  The offbeat campaign resulted in significant word of mouth for Burger King 


-  ,  Traditionally ,  companies can estimate word of mouth through surveys that measure the likelihood of recommendation or can use customer satisfaction ,  loyalty and purchase likelihood as proxies for word of mouth ,  but online ,  word of mouth can be measured directly 


-  More sophisticated methodologies are often required to measure word of mouth because  significant amount can occur either offline or online via private communication ,  where direct measurement is impossible 


-  User-generated content can also embed consumers favorite brands  ( such as in  video on YouTube or  photo posted on Flickr )  and contribute to word of mouth  and companies can organize such experiences on behalf of their consumers 


-  For example ,  Atrapalo 


- com ,  one of Spains leading online travel agencies ,  included on its site  way for consumers to share travel videos and customer photos 


-  ,  The advantage of starting with consumer motivations ,  as opposed to trying to figure out what social media application to use ,  is that it makes clear how seemingly disparate applications are actually quite similar if they share the same underlying motivations for use 


-  This makes the job of creating integrated marketing campaigns not only less overwhelming for the manager but also much more closely tied to online consumer behavior 


-  ,  In other words ,  the question is not whether to blog or tweet ,  but what objectives need to be achieved and which set of tools with their corresponding metrics can best achieve them 


-  ,  Once managers have  set of objectives in place for their social media efforts and understand that consumers are motivated to make investments in companies social media efforts through their interactions with the brand ,  the next step is to consider the strategic options for social media measurement 


-  ,  Our simple    framework ,  which assumes the manager has  social media effort ongoing ,  neatly summarizes the choices managers face as they strive to develop social media strategy and suggests better  ( and worse )  paths toward social media success 


-  Managers find themselves in this quadrant as  result of the throw it on the wall and see what sticks strategy and perform arbitrary changes with no way to measure their impact 


-  Because measurement is fuzzy and the efforts effectiveness appears to be failing ,  the manager has little insight or idea on what to do 


-  This is distinctly different than the dead end scenario ,  because even though the manager does not believe he is succeeding ,  at least he is making some attempt to measure social media effectiveness 


-  Since the components are being measured ,  there are probably some good clues about what is going wrong 


-  Since the components are being measured ,  the manager can purposefully iterate to improve even more 


-  This quadrant is tricky because although it is  reasonable place to start ,  you want to move out of it as fast as possible so you dont get stuck here 


-  ,  Managers have two good options for moving from nave optimism to iterate for success and one poor choice 


-  Let us examine the poor choice first 


-  This is because the lack of measurement will eventually lead to deterioration in the efforts effectiveness over time ,  particularly as competitors are able to do it better 


-  In either case ,  the goal is to move away from fuzzy measurement and toward quantifiable metrics where the manager can get  real handle on what is working and what is not and then follow the best path that will get him where he needs to go 


-  Although measuring the ROI of social media efforts is important and necessary ,  it is far more important that managers make sure their social media efforts are effective ,  even if the state of ROI measurement may be less than satisfactory 


-  In order to maximize the effectiveness of their social media efforts ,  managers must recognize two important facts of social media life when implementing social media campaigns 


-  For example ,   manager can control who posts to  blog devoted to the companys brand 


-  Many managers still approach social media as if the practices  and consumer behaviors  are largely fixed 


-  Social media-savvy managers know this is not the case ,  but traditional beliefs about how to reach consumers and potential consumers die hard 


-  ,  Our premise is that social media efforts that are developed in the context of the 4cs  connections ,  creation ,  consumption and control  that underlie consumer motivations to participate will lead to higher ROI because the companys marketing investments can better leverage the active investments its customers will make as they engage with the companys brands 


-  These investments can take the form of blog comments ,  registration and active participation to become  part of  brand-related community ,  private endorsements of  brand or product  (  tweet or retweet ,  Facebook comment ,  review ,  blog post or offline recommendations to friends )  and the like 


-  While the content of consumers interactions is largely out of managers control ,  setting up the framework to facilitate that interaction is squarely in their control 


-  Instead ,  they listen carefully because they know that consumers not only consume the campaign ,  but can comment on it  ( create )  ,  share it with their friends and anyone else  ( connect )  and provide their uncensored thoughts about it  ( control )  for any and all to view 


-  For example ,  if  consumer posts  question to the managers blog ,  someone with  face in the company must reply 


-  If  video is uploaded ,  someone must monitor the Twitter stream for comments and be prepared to react if problems appear 


-  The result tends to be campaigns that expect the customer to work for the brand 


-  In contrast ,  effective social media strategies put the brand to work for the customers by satisfying their needs to create ,  consume ,  connect and control in the social Web 


-  The social metrics that reflect these kinds of social media behaviors are important not only because they let marketers measure the bottom-line impact of their social media efforts ,  but also because they focus marketers attention on social media strategies that take into account the objectives of both the brand and the online customer 


-  ,  There is reason to be highly optimistic about improving the effectiveness of social media 


-  The social Web is  highly measurable environment ,  and it is  relatively simple matter for  manager to measure the number of product reviews ,  blog posts and comments ,  retweets and appearances in the social network timelines of the companys brands 


-  At the same time ,  managers are often able to measure click-throughs to transactional websites ,  as well as capture the number of leads generated or conversion rates for online sales 


-  ,  offline purchases or offline word of mouth )  ,  we think that carefully planned social media campaigns afford phenomenal opportunities for relatively easy and cost-efficient measurement of customers online investments in  companys brands 


- Three teen-aged girls are at  shopping mall looking for sunscreen 


-  Its an impulse purchase ,  and it has to be an all-natural choice 


-  They think theyve found what theyre looking for at one store ,  but on the way to the register one of the girls takes out her phone and swipes it by the barcode of the product theyve selected 


-  Moments later ,  as shes pulling out  credit card at the register ,  her iPhone announces an incoming email 


-  Its  short message informing her that the item she is about to purchase contains compounds that are linked to the decimation of coral reefs 


-  Because her phone has pinpointed her location via GPS ,  she also learns that another store in the mall carries  greener sunscreen that has neither of those two problems 


-  The girls leave the register and make  beeline for the other store 


-  In fact ,  the technology needed to make it happen is already in place 


-  are developing sustainability indices; one day soon comparative product ratings will be posted next to price tags 


- com provides  free iPhone app that rates and compares tens of thousands of products on their environmental ,  health and social impacts 


-  Because of such technologies ,  the guiding principle for many companies ,  increasingly ,  is caveat venditor: let the seller beware 


-  As many markets become ever more transparent to environmentally conscious customers ,  the pursuit of sustainability will shift from  choice that companies make to  sheer necessity of survival 


-  It will affect the de facto license of  business to operate   license that customers wont hesitate to revoke 


-  ,  Many executives understand how these dynamics will fundamentally alter their businesses ,  and they understand that sustainability is ,  ultimately ,  about the sustainability of their own organizations 


-  But they often stumble in making the transition because of basic misconceptions about what it will take to transform their companies 


-  Many make the mistake of treating sustainability like any other large corporate initiative: Its actually different in several crucial ways 


-  Or they assume that it will require  steady ,  constant effort over years 


-  In fact ,  it entails three distinct phases ,  each requiring different leadership skills 


-  When implementing  business strategy that commercially incorporates sustainability ,  managers must first recognize how such efforts are unique ,  and then understand how best to advance through each major stage of  sustainability initiative 


-  Today ,  many corporations view sustainability as  strategic opportunity and are pursuing it as an operational competence 


-  The most advanced of these organizations are now thinking of sustainability as  core value  the fundamental way in which they do business 


-  To achieve that kind of transformation ,  executives must first understand the three basic ways in which sustainability is substantively different from other kinds of corporate initiatives 


-  Second ,  other initiatives tend to be unambiguously commercial decisions: costs are cut ,  target segments are expanded ,  pricing is commoditized 


-  In the case of sustainability ,  the organization frequently starts not only with an unclear picture of its potential commercial impact but also with  blurred definition of sustainability itself 


-  Third ,  other corporate initiatives  such as implementing just-in-time concepts or reorganizing from products to geographies  can generally be  part of  sustainability strategy ,  which will itself be greater in scope 


-  However ,  different initiatives pursued in concert with one another will frequently be asynchronous in their evolution 


-  Each phase relies on different levels of organizational capability and  specific set of leadership competencies on the part of the individual heading that effort 


-  ,  When an organization is largely unprepared to address sustainability ,  the key challenge is to make  clear and compelling case for change 


-  Because the organization is at best reactive to the challenges of sustainability  ( and usually unaware of the opportunities )  ,  the sustainability leader must be adept at collaborating and influencing others in the course of the transition from unconscious to conscious reactivity 


-  ,  At some point ,  nearly every company has been unconsciously reactive to sustainability 


-  The trigger has often been explicitly reflected on the C-level dashboard  ( impending regulatory action or media exposure from environmental disasters ,  for instance )  but increasingly it is rooted in more gradual trends  ( such as the growing scarcity of  key manufacturing input or the evolution of comparative product metrics )  


-  Either way ,  the organization begins to engage with sustainability but lacks  shared and consistent understanding of what it means 


-  As such ,  an important task in Phase  is the early identification of important but as yet ill-defined risks and opportunities 


-  This process can be difficult because senior executives might not yet fully appreciate the significance of the issue 


-  The thing we struggle with is engaging the general managers ,  who actually run businesses ,  says the head of sustainability at  major educational publisher 


-  The leader must communicate  compelling vision and gain buy-in from key opinion formers in the organization 


-  Leaders must help identify ,  define and develop  specific set of business processes geared to manage previously unquantified risks and capture new opportunities 


-  Consequently ,  the leader must be able to deal with ambiguity and still be effective in guiding the organization through Phase  


-  In some ways ,  the company has been environmentally friendly since 1938 ,  when it launched its first insulation product 


-  ( OBrien-Bernini would serve in  dual role as the companys head of R&D as well as chief sustainability officer ,  or CSO ,  for two years before relinquishing his R&D responsibilities altogether 


-  )  Leveraging the explicit support he had from Brown ,  OBrien-Bernini created  sustainability council composed of the most influential executives and managers at Owens Corning ,  including representatives from all businesses and functions 


-  I chose them primarily for their ability to influence the organization 


-  First ,  he wanted to maximize the impact of the council ,  and he realized that doing so required decision makers 


-  Second ,  he was aware that  as  corollary  if he merely assembled  team of tree huggers ,  the credibility of the effort would immediately be in question 


-  Third ,  he believed that having leaders of different products and geographies on the council would enhance the companys ability to cross-pollinate successful initiatives across the entire organization 


-  ,  With its sustainability council in place ,  Owens Corning began focusing on seven critical issues: energy use ,  greenhouse gases ,  particulate emissions ,  volatile organic compound  ( VOC )  emissions ,  water use ,  waste and nitrous-oxide emissions 


-  These priorities were communicated to the different plants ,  and capital was set aside for the best projects 


-  The competition fostered widespread participation to reduce energy consumption ,  decrease greenhouse gas emissions and so on 


-  It was  good deal for the plants as they realized that the best ideas across the company would get funded ,  recalls OBrien-Bernini 


-  ,  Quick wins ,  including many environmental projects that achieved payback in less than  year ,  helped convert many skeptics 


-  Others took more effort ,  as in the case of  production line that was redesigned to operate on significantly less pressure ,  which not only conserved the energy used by the air compressors but also resulted in fewer leaks and longer life for the manufacturing equipment 


-  Its  matter of collecting successes you can point to and say ,  This is making  difference ,  says OBrien-Bernini 


-  ,  Two general rules apply to these types of initial projects 


-  First ,  they need to emphasize the quantitative  ( that is ,  the bottom line )  in favor of the qualitative  ( for example ,  concepts like brand equity )  to convince skeptics of the business case 


-  One effective approach is to help grow the top line ,  for example ,  by finding buyers for substances previously considered waste  ( such as partially cured resins ,  compost or impure ethylene glycol )  


-  Consider  major home-improvement retailer that offers free haul-away of old appliances for customers who buy new ones 


-  The company has recently been exploring refurbishing those used appliances for resale in Latin America ,  where they would be more energy efficient than the older models currently in use 


-  This might be true partly because it is generally less necessary for senior leaders to collaborate than to lead change; it may also reflect these individuals preference for control 


-  The right leaders for Phase  are driven by the need to change  supporting it ,  advocating it and motivating others to initiate it 


-  Moreover ,  they know how to get the support of others by building enduring partnerships across the organization 


-  To accomplish this ,  they frame the dialogue in terms of issues that matter to managers ,  delineating the elements of sustainability that register as commercially substantive risks or rewards 


-  Now the task is to translate high-level commitments into  comprehensive change program with clearly defined initiatives and hard commercial targets 


-  To make this happen ,  sustainability leaders in Phase  must excel at delivering results ,  and they must have  strong commercial awareness 


-  At the end of this phase ,  the organization is consciously proactive on sustainability across its footprint and tracks economic ,  environmental and social metrics over the business planning cycle 


-  As such ,  the sustainability leader must display the following two competencies: results delivery and commercial orientation 


-  In addition ,  leaders must focus and prioritize efforts that generate the most value for the organization over the business planning cycle 


-  ,  The management adage what gets measured gets done strongly applies to Phase  


-  Although little data and no metrics existed before ,  there is now  concerted effort to measure and accumulate hard financial ,  environmental and social data so that the organization can make smarter decisions about various trade-offs 


-  Consider the case of  food products company in Europe 


-  Managers there introduced metrics to track the ratio of packaging material to food mass ,  and that data initially led to  discussion of whether to increase the container size for  particular product ,  which would result in proportionally less packaging 


-  But  competing metric was the amount of non-natural ingredients in that product 


-   comprehensive analysis led managers to recognize that by shrinking the container size they could do away with  class of chemical preservatives altogether because the smaller size would result in faster consumption ,  which would allow for compressed expiration dates 


-  ,  As managers of business units learn to perform these types of analyses ,  the sustainability leader can begin handing off operational responsibility to them 


-  At Owens Corning ,  the sustainability council was disbanded and responsibility was diffused to the plant managers ,  who understood the corporate goals and were encouraged to develop effective local metrics for monitoring and guiding the environmental impact and energy efficiency of their operations 


-  This could be something as simple as reducing the daily number of dumpster hauls ,   change that was made at  plant in Amarillo ,  Texas 


-  The word broken ,  for example ,  was redefined to include the notion of wasteful 


-  ,  Phase  is not simply about becoming  better corporate citizen through increased sustainability 


-  Commercial results are crucial 


-   major magazine publisher ,  for example ,  recognized that its advertisers were becoming increasingly interested in the forestry management practices of its suppliers 


-  The company now champions the fact that it has increased the amount of certified fiber used in its magazines from 20% to 80% 


-  It also had to take  hard look at its entire sustainability footprint ,  including the post-consumption of its products 


-  As  result ,  it partnered with the National Recycling Coalition Inc 


-  and launched  program that increased the amount of recycled magazines by 30% in its first year 


-  ,  Sometimes ,   deep knowledge of sustainability issues can ,  by itself ,  provide  huge competitive advantage when leveraged in the appropriate ways 


-  At Owens Corning ,   general manager of one of the businesses was working with  potential customer seeking to manufacture carbon-neutral products 


-  The GM was able to discuss those products with respect to the carbon offsets required and describe exactly what the customer would have to do to compensate for the raw materials used 


-  The ability to engage in that type of conversation not only won Owens Corning  large materials contract but also led the company to realize it could begin to use its sustainability leadership position to create differentiated value with customers 


-  ,  We have found that executives who are effective in Phase  tend to be comfortable with the distinction between the ideology of sustainability and the sustainability goals that the organization seeks to achieve 


-  These executives are motivated by commercial targets and view sustainability as one arrow in their quiver to hit those targets 


-  In the case of the magazine publisher ,  the companys increased use of certified fiber and its participation in helping to create citywide recycling programs were motivated by advertisers beginning to become concerned about placing ads in publications that had potential liabilities with respect to the environment 


-  The publisher chose to take preemptive action rather than wait and hope for the best ,  and the reasoning behind that decision was founded entirely in economic logic rather than ideology 


-  Some people are motivated by their personal commitment around climate change ,  others to the bottom line 


-  In my role ,   actually dont care what motivates people as long as it drives us to our goal 


-  This combination requires the synthesis of multiple and frequently conflicting trends to develop  coherent long-term strategy that manages trade-offs and ensures that the organization is aligned with key sustainability principles for years to come 


-  Consider ,  for example ,  an aviation manufacturer that looked 20 years ahead to see how its market was likely to evolve 


-  Industry projections had suggested that over the next two decades the number of planes in the air would increase from 18 , 000 to 36 , 000 ,  but the company decided to challenge those projections in the context of sustainability 


-  What if more airports or runways arent built? What if contiguous land masses that have high-speed rail between large cities make it illegal to fly between those metropolitan areas? What if companies need to start pricing carbon? The commercial impact is difficult to estimate ,  but its crucial to get  handle on ,  says that companys head of sustainability 


-  ,  Sustainability leaders in Phase  must evolve into futurists ,  pursuing long-term investments and partnerships that strengthen and transform organizational assets 


-  They need to be inquisitive and reflective ,  asking tough questions that probe the core purpose of the organization: What are the ways in which we can profitably run our business without fear of environmental degradation or social inequity? How can we anticipate ,  influence and benefit from regulatory changes that relate to sustainability? How can we leverage sustainability to create differentiation and competitive advantage in our markets? ,  The answers to such questions will often require sustainability leaders to establish  more sophisticated  ( and frequently unconventional )  level of engagement with external stakeholders such as competitors ,  NGOs and other organizations that might well have been viewed as adversarial in the past 


-  eliminated Styrofoam from the packaging of its fast foods ,  for example ,  it did so by partnering with the Environmental Defense Fund 


-  are now working with the EDF around initiatives designed to minimize the environmental impact of their businesses 


-  ,  In Phase  ,  the sustainability leader must often advocate for new approaches and practices that run counter to how the organization has long conducted its business 


-  For example ,  the leader might need to challenge the way in which investments are typically viewed by arguing for an adjustment to traditional hurdle rates when considering initiatives that would generate  significant return ,  but over  longer time period 


-  We have to  develop sustainable ,  waste-free product[s] designed for manufacturability and recyclability for tomorrow ,  says the CSO of  global high-tech company 


-  We couldnt do that if we had not changed the way we look at our financial model ,  because in many cases it means paying more up front for supply parts that have superior LCA [life cycle analysis] characteristics and lifetime costs 


-  Decisions are still made in favor of the commercially optimal solution but ,  thanks to an expanded time horizon ,  the burden of up-front costs can be more substantially reduced by factoring in the long-term benefits 


-  In addition  ( and as importantly )  ,  longer time horizons force companies to consider the dangers of making decisions that benefit the short term but might provoke  consumer backlash further down the road 


-  At Owens Corning ,   transition to  new CEO in 2007 did not alter the companys commitment to sustainability 


-  Rather ,  the new CEO ,  Michael Thaman ,  increased the companys focus on energy efficiency ,  renewables and environmentally responsible manufacturing as key to growth 


-  Consider how the company has been leveraging the beginnings of radical transparency in its industry by conducting life cycle analyses of its products ,  seeking third-party certifications and verifications of its claims ,  and working to influence standards-setting bodies 


-  Among other offerings ,  the program provides builders with online verification of products that have received third-party certification 


-  Owens Cornings insulation products were the first to make the list ,  and they appear first when builders click on the websites drop-down menu 


-  Builders that want to adhere to green standards can readily determine that Owens Corning products have the necessary third-party certifications 


-  If they are considering using  competitors products that lack certification ,  they must go through the time-consuming process of proving to the NAHB that those products meet green standards 


-  Having the right products is an important first step says OBrien-Bernini ,  then making your products easy to specify elevates your competitive edge 


-  But the point here is not that information transparency is  serendipitous benefit that can result from  sustainability initiative 


-  ,  This brings us back to the mall ,  where the three teen-aged girls have just purchased another brand of sunscreen at  different store 


-  Maybe its something about the cool new brand of sunscreen theyve found; or perhaps its about their disgust at the product they abandoned 


-  ,  So ,  to paraphrase the novelist William Gibson ,  the future is already here; its just not distributed evenly yet 


-  Today ,  young consumers like these teenagers are buying products ,  intuitively using an emerging set of tools 


-  ,  And while theyre buying products today ,  they will be running businesses tomorrow 


-  In the meantime ,  companies that want be around when this happens must find leaders with the right competencies to build  bridge to the future
