- In the early 1990s ,   Fortune 100 company contemplated making  sizable investment to manufacture and distribute  core product in Asia 


-  In making his judgment ,  he overlooked financial ,  operational and strategic information that contradicted his views 


-  Senior executives ,  relying on the companys  


-  After the resulting debacle and much soul searching ,  managers realized that they had let themselves be misled by their untested assumptions 


-  ,  Such problems are not new ,  but in todays world ,  they can be fatal 


-  Rapid advances in information and production technologies have combined with global expansion and competition to create  business environment in which change is the norm 


-  ,  Theres nothing wrong with change 


-  Classic management texts insist change is necessary for business survival and exhort executives to abandon their organizational isolationism  and their naive belief in environmental stability and homogenous ,  conflict-free workplaces 


-  In dynamic internal and external business environments ,  leaders must be able to interpret cues and make decisions 


-  But decision making is increasingly complex and success uncertain 


-  To ager can handle an expatriate assignment ,  for example ,   decision maker might need to use intuitive assessment in addition to analytic tools and research 


-  Not surprisingly ,  increasing numbers of companies invest in programs to help managers improve intuitive judgment 


-  ,  Although intuitive judgment has benefits ,  mounting evidence suggests that it often runs contrary to rational thinking ,  with managers confidence in their judgments and predictions far exceeding objective accuracy rates 


-  Also ,  objectively irrelevant factors may influence choices 


-  For example ,  some research shows that policy decisions based on numbers of jobs saved are often different from decisions based on numbers of jobs lost 


-  Other research demonstrates that members of negotiating teams believe they have more-powerful bargaining positions than do solo counterparts ,  even when the only difference is the number of negotiators at the bargaining table 


-  Most important ,  people who are unaware of the problems with intuitive judgment fail to compensate for it in their decision making 


-  Our analysis and field research have highlighted how projection has affected industries as diverse as consumer products ,  petroleum ,  manufacturing and professional services 


-  ,  The Fortune 100 manufacturing company that blundered in  promising Asian market illustrates projections insidious effects 


-  Despite detailed analysis ,  the go/no-go decision was not clear-cut 


-  Attractive financing was available; however ,  market data looked only marginally favorable ,  and political and cultural factors were unknowns 


-  If anything ,  the bulk of the evidence suggested aborting the initiative 


-  He was sure that others really shared his beliefs and were merely being cautious 


-  Political and labor problems doubled the time required for construction of the manufacturing facilities 


-  Inadequate infrastructure and external parties unwillingness to fulfill agreements thwarted distribution 


-  North American control systems created friction with employees ,  and Asian consumers did not take to the product as readily as anticipated 


-  ,  In subsequent candid discussions ,  the project champion revealed that he knew the business case had been weak 


-  He had made an intuitive judgment and assumed that his own beliefs ,  values and experiences were shared by others  projection at work 


-  The members of the planning and investment committees also projected their values and experiences onto the Asian business environment 


-  ,  Understanding projection and its impact on decision making can not only explain inconsistencies and irrational choices ,  it can prevent the problems from occurring 


-  Most often ,  we overestimate the proportion of others who share our beliefs 


-  Because of our bias ,  we assume that the beliefs and behavior of others will be like ours 


-  Both those who cheated and those who didnt overestimated the commonness of their particular tendency 


- 10 Recruiters who would say no to requests for polygraph tests or to marital-status disclosures  ( which employers are proscribed from demanding )  expected higher rates of refusal from others 


-   recruiter who would agree to take  polygraph test assumed that most candidates would also  and that  noncompliant candidate had something to hide 


-  ,  What psychological processes underlie the perception that ones own beliefs are common to most people? Researchers have identified five possibilities: surrounding oneself with similar others  ( selective exposure and cognitive availability )  attending to ones own views the most  ( salience of point of view )  believing that ones own behavior is based on the situation and that others behavior is based on their nature  ( causal attributions )  filling in the gaps in ambiguous situations  ( situational construal )  and needing to validate ones own beliefs  ( motivation )  


- 11 Selective exposure refers to peoples tendency to select friends ,  acquaintances ,  colleagues and advisers who share their backgrounds ,  interests ,  values and outlooks 


-  It is not surprising that when consulting similar others ,  people hear their own views and conclude that almost everyone shares those views 


-  Selective exposure creates  bias in their understanding of the variety of views others hold 


- 12 Cognitive availability refers to the mental process by which people bring certain information to mind 


-  Rather than conduct an exhaustive search ,  they search their memories for readily available information ,  which includes their own views and any data that support those views 


-   global consulting organization convened biannually  group of senior executives and valued managers for two days of operational meetings 


-  Because individuals were nominated by their regional offices ,  it was understood that they represented the opinions of  local peer group 


-  They advised the executives on how company policies affected individuals at the senior-consultant and manager levels 


-  As the organizations employee base diversified throughout the 1990s ,   broader array of interests were discussed ,  including day-care facilities ,  nondiscriminatory work practices ,  elder care and general quality-of-life issues 


-  ,  The first time an African-American participated in the group was at  planning session one of the authors facilitated 


-  When it was her turn ,  the new member said ,  somewhat nervously ,  that advancement within the firm was particularly difficult for members of minority groups 


-  ,  In private conversation with the author ,  the senior executive explained why he had handled the diversity issue as he did 


-  He had thought deeply about the issue ,  trying to remember examples of problems in the company 


-  He had consulted with others ,  and they had confirmed what he believed 


-  He further explained that he had talked about the issue with his partners  ( white and male )  ,  with whom he felt comfortable discussing [such]  sensitive topic and that previous conversations with the managers in the room had given him the impression that they ,  like himself ,  were unwilling to discuss it 


-  ,  In projecting his own beliefs onto others ,  the senior executive overlooked  potentially important issue ,  marginalized  promising manager and perhaps decreased the likelihood of hearing from her again 


-  ,  The executive responded that way because of his selective exposure to partners who reinforced his viewpoint and led him to conclude that his beliefs were shared by an even broader population  ( the managers in the room and beyond )  


-  Unlike secondhand information ,  our own knowledge and experiences are rich and vivid 


-  That vividness captures our attention and biases both the information we gather from others and our judgments 


-  Alternative views and options recede 


-  Research shows that when people consider  particular course of action ,  their perception that others would agree with their conclusion increases ,  and their perception of the commonness of differing beliefs diminishes 


-  Stalwarts seven senior executives ,  having completed their annual off-site strategic-planning cycle with one of the authors ,  were preparing for  board meeting 


-  To the author ,  the planning meetings had seemed to run smoothly 


-  He indicated that in the past each individual had negotiated merely for the good of her or his respective department ,  and he was glad he didnt have to meet individually with members to secure support this time 


-  In fact ,  the chief financial officer was shocked ,  pointing to  thick binder of strategic and financial analyses indicating the acquisition was not the right way to proceed 


-  He held steadfastly to that vivid personal vision despite others concerns 


-  ,  The process of understanding and attributing causes of behavior is another driver of projection 


-  Specifically ,  projection is greater when people consider that their own beliefs and behaviors are arising from the situation  ( situational factors )  rather than from their disposition  ( personal factors )  


- 18 Personal factors are stable characteristics of an individual ,  whereas situational factors emphasize the external circumstances in which the individual operates 


-  Attributing their decisions to the realities of  situation ,  executives assume that most others would respond similarly 


-  ,  Although individuals maintain that their own behavior is determined by the situation ,  they usually believe that the behavior of others is based on personality or disposition  ( actor-observer effect )  


-  Thus when two managers disagree ,  each believes the others dogged persistence is attributable to stubbornness but that his or her own persistence is  sensible response that other reasonable managers would likely support 


-  ,  That thought process is particularly prevalent when the same information leads to different recommendations; it frequently emerges in new cross-functional teams focused on product development or organizational redesign 


-  Such temporary teams generally bring together people from diverse functions who are preoccupied with the effect  decision could have on their department 


-  ,  When one person disagrees with  recommended course of action because of its perceived effect on his or her department ,  others often fail to consider that persons situation ,  assuming instead that the dissension springs from  contrary disposition 


-  Believing their view is shared by other team members ,  they become increasingly certain that if the dissenter were rational and working in the organizations best interests ,  he or she would not disagree 


-  They point out that most social situations are ambiguous and lead people to fill in the gaps from whatever personal knowledge they have 


-  The European office of  Brussels-based  


-  multinational corporation and its French supplier spent several days discussing costs ,  product packaging ,  quality standards ,  distribution processes and related issues 


-  The author decided to interview each side separately to understand the precise meaning of special relationship 


-  He detailed the presumed benefits to both companies ,  noting that the French company ultimately would be required to open its books 


-  ,  The French had  different understanding of special relationship 


-  The French team expected to continue with its favorable arrangement  one that enabled it to pursue other partnerships 


-  ,  Each group relied on its own construal of the vague phrase special relationship and projected its own understanding onto the other party 


-  Not surprisingly ,   misunderstanding ensued 


-  When the Brussels team got specific about being exclusive and opening the books ,  it saw the French respond coolly and realized something was awry 


-  Each party viewed the others reactions as surprising and inappropriate; negotiations foundered and mutual trust suffered 


-  However ,  motivational factors ,  such as the desire for social acceptance or the need to maintain self-esteem ,  also play  role in projection and may work independently of the cognitive drivers 


- 21 ,  Research shows that overestimating consensus for their positions helps individuals with minority views bolster their self-esteem 


- 22 Those whose identity is threatened by receiving negative feedback comprise another group that overestimates others support 


- 23 According to the motivational explanation for projection ,  newly arrived executives who are unsure of their standing  and executives whose intuitive ability ,  not their quantitative ability ,  has led to their rise through the ranks will overestimate consensus 


-  ,  Note that in discussing projection ,  we are careful to avoid saying two things 


-  In fact ,  some studies show that when objective information is lacking ,  people who project their own preferences onto others may be more accurate than those who do not 


- 24 In one study ,  respondents making predictions about people who were highly similar to themselves used their own preferences as proxies and were more accurate than were those who did not rely on their personal preferences 


- 25 Note also that when people have no belief about how others might respond ,  they are unlikely to engage in projection 


- 26 In such cases ,  people understand the inappropriateness of using their own responses as proxies for someone elses 


- 27 Not only do people underestimate the commonness of their abilities ,  but their bias about the uniqueness of  particular attribute increases as the attributes importance to them increases 


-  Training that explains the nature of the bias ,  even when combined with decision-making projects immediately followed by feedback ,  is not enough 


- 28 Training may reduce projections effect when  series of repetitive decisions occur in  narrow context ,  but training has not proved highly effective for decisions that are not routine  precisely the type that executives face 


-  Inferential errors are  natural part of being human; it is unwise to assume the susceptibility applies only to others 


-  To create awareness ,  managers must first accept the fact that most people  themselves included  overestimate the commonness of their beliefs 


-  That realization may help managers be more attentive to the diversity of opinion in their companies 


-  Next ,  they must accept the fact that projection is difficult to overcome because it is the result of tacit mental processes 


-  Attenuating biased decision processes takes practice 


-  ,  At company planning sessions ,  the authors have created awareness of decision biases using relatively simple activities for example ,  empirically demonstrating overconfidence and incorrect assumptions about others views 


-  An experiential learning activity ,  such as having people champion an opposing viewpoint ,  has helped individuals realize they are not immune to projection 


-  Combining lectures with experiential demonstration helps create an environment in which executives hold themselves individually and collectively accountable for maintaining an awareness of how the projection of their own beliefs onto others might affect the decisions they make 


-  Getting people to reduce reliance on their own judgments and seek out contrary evidence can improve decision making greatly 


-  That principle applies to individuals decisions as well as groups ,  but given the deep-seated nature of projection and the speed with which it occurs ,  it is helpful to have group members hold one another accountable 


- 29 It attenuates the natural inclination to underestimate the role of situational factors in others behavior 


-  ,   useful exercise involves adopting an adversarys position and assuming it is legitimate 


-  Generating  list of supportive arguments for the adversarys view can help people recognize the bias in their assumptions and the merits of other positions 


-  Once  manager begins to understand the situational arguments in support of anothers viewpoint ,  it is easier to reach consensus on  course of action 


-  ,  Interpersonal conflict often creates discomfort for people; however ,  it can hold the key to overcoming the negative consequences of projection 


-  Executives need to challenge their assumptions and recommendations  and the assumptions and recommendations of others 


-  One easy way is to enhance the diversity of perspectives represented in the companys inner circle and require that members share their perspectives openly and constructively challenge one anothers views 


-  In the United States ,  the process often involves challenging the status quo and envisioning competing choices 


-  Antagonistic discussions erupt among members of different functional units ,  with people clinging to their own perspectives and attacking others 


-  In such cases ,  it is important to avoid attributing others behavior to personality problems and instead to focus on the information the others are using 


-  Team members must take time to analyze their own information as well 


-  In facilitated sessions ,  the authors encourage people to make explicit the knowledge they rely on when drawing conclusions about others 


-  People need to ask themselves ,  What behavior have  really observed? Might  be mistakenly attributing intent because the other person has  different view? ,  Auditing key decisions and the process by which they unfold can help attenuate projection 


-  Decisions in organizations are often made in stages ,  with ambiguous data quickly becoming unquestioned facts 


- 31 To help ensure that key assumptions are grounded in data ,  decision makers should review them carefully 


-  ,  The most effective audit is  facilitated group session that leverages each persons perspective 


-  Although it would be inefficient to analyze every decision ,  major decisions about employment and investments may merit additional investigation 


-  Stepping back and checking the facts  and the process by which the facts were generated  can uncover projection and improve the quality of decision making 


-  In general ,  groups are more likely to uncover important information if they discuss facts rather than opinions 


-  ,  When collective review is not  viable option ,  individuals should reflect on decision processes by themselves 


-  We all selectively encode and access information in memory and can reconstruct and confidently hold memories of events that never occurred 


-  Managers should be aware of memorys fallibility and malleability whenever they reconstruct peoples behavior from memory and use it to attribute intentions to others 


-  Focused questions can help: Am  relying too heavily on data culled from my own memory and experience to the point of blinding myself to other data? Are there other possible interpretations of the situation? Did  entertain multiple outcomes or courses of action? Reflective questions linked to the different theoretical explanations for projection can raise self-awareness and minimize unanticipated outcomes 


-  When making decisions ,  executives often ask ,  What did we do last time? The salience of traditional or standard solutions may stifle consideration of alternatives 


-  To decide what role it should play ,   manager should ask ,  How well did tradition serve us in past decisions? Do the same tenets apply to the current scenario? ,  Also ,  managers should not be seduced by the salience of their own actions to the point that they overlook knowledge from others 


-  Asking questions such as What did competitors do and how did their choices fare? helps ensure that decisions are grounded firmly in information relevant to the current scenario 


-  ,  According to the motivational explanation of projection ,  the reason people want to believe that others share their views is that they crave social acceptance 


-  They also may convince themselves that they possess unique levels of certain abilities  say ,  knowing the best way to manage  software-development project or how to understand other people 


-  Decision makers who realize that confidence in their skill is not widely shared may experience  threat to their self-worth 


-  Disentangling self-worth and estimates of consensus will lead to greater realism in decision making 


- 33 Executives must assimilate information and make decisions in chaotic environments  often without the benefit of sufficient practice ,  planning or research 


-  Understanding projection can help people see why they often perceive others decisions and actions as irrational or misguided 


-  And it can help explain how  smart ,  well-meaning executive could decide to expand into Asia  confident of success  while perpetuating North American perspectives ,  policies and practices 


-  Knowledge about projection also can reveal the causes of failed interpersonal relationships by helping managers develop insight into the workings of their own minds as they try to make sense of others actions
