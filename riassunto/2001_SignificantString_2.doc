-  Some of these companies have made impressive strides ,  but many have suffered from the lack of reliable guides along the road to e-business transformation 


-  ,  To help remedy that situation ,  we have developed an operational model of e-business value creation that is backed by substantial research 


-  We have tested the model ,  which is rooted in what is known as information-technology business-value research ,  by gathering data from more than  , 000 small ,  midsize and large companies in  variety of sectors 


-  )  The models premise ,  one that is borne out by the data in our study ,  is deceptively simple: that the achievement of e-business operational excellence will lead to improved financial performance 


-  The central task for senior managers ,  then ,  lies in understanding what drives operational excellence in the e-business realm  and then committing the necessary resources to the development of the drivers 


-  Before we get to the tour ,  however ,  we will briefly lay out the central components of e-business operational excellence 


-  ,  Managers should assess  companys operations by looking at both traditional and e-business measures 


-  Many companies ,  however ,  are less focused on tracking e-business measures ,  including the percentage of an organizations total business that has been transacted online ,  the percentage of goods purchased online from suppliers ,  the number of existing customers doing business online ,  the number of new customers acquired online ,  and the percentage of customer-service requests handled online 


-  )  ,  To be successful with e-business operations ,  it is not enough to earn revenues online 


-  ,  Online procurement goes on behind the scenes and is difficult to implement ,  but it may be the most important element of e-business operational excellence for large corporations 


-  Startups ,  of course ,  have had to start from scratch ,  but established companies have the less daunting job of getting existing customers to do business online in such cases ,  some measure of trust is already in place 


-  lead online customer-service efforts 


-  They will be able to move with more assurance once they properly understand what drives e-business operational excellence 


-  ,  In trying to bring about e-business transformation ,  companies have generally focused too much of their attention on technology 


-  But systems do not work in  vacuum ,  and senior managers must recognize the complementary nature of technology ,  business processes and e-business readiness throughout the value chain 


- 11 By taking  more holistic view ,  managers can turn those facets of  companys operations into the drivers of e-business excellence 


-  The drivers we identified in our study encompass three areas: e-business processes for customers and suppliers; IT applications for customers ,  suppliers and internal operations  ( all of which must be integrated )  and the e-business readiness of customers and suppliers 


-  The first step in getting e-business processes right is providing the customer with  single point of contact ,  either through the Web site or through contact with one ,  and only one ,  representative of the company  (  sales rep or customer-service rep ,  for example )  


-  GEs appliance division ,  however ,  has  customer-answer center that routes feedback to managers in marketing ,  dealer relationship ,  customer service ,  manufacturing and new-product development 


-  Of course ,  neither buyers nor suppliers will share sensitive information in real time unless an atmosphere of trust prevails 


-  Companies need to put  set of strategic process changes in place to create an environment of mutual trust 


-  ,  The processes needed to fully develop mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers are myriad  consider the importance of developing the right supplier-selection criteria and of establishing metrics to evaluate partners  and few large organizations have made much progress in this area 


-  )  ,  An effective e-business operation provides Web-site visitors with detailed information 


-  The lesson is that IT applications must be aligned with the rest of the e-business model; in this case ,  customization has to be integrated into the entire supply chain 


-  ,  Although customer-facing IT systems are in  sense visible to public scrutiny  and thus are likely to get more attention  the success of e-business hinges on electronic linkages between supply-chain partners 


-  In other words ,  it must provide features similar to those offered to customers: online communities and an FAQ section ,  as well as supplier-evaluation reports 


- 16 The application links Home Depots point-of-purchase data to its accounting processes and also to GEs e-business systems 


- 17 Because its internal IT applications were so well developed ,  GE Capital has been able to adapt more quickly to e-business with its customers and suppliers 


-  ,  The success of  companys e-business initiatives depends not only on its own efforts but also on the readiness of its customers and suppliers to engage in electronic interactions 


-  ,  Dell Computer ,  for example ,  implemented an online supply-chain-management application to help its component suppliers increase the accuracy of their forecasts; the application gives suppliers direct access to customer-order information 


- 19 And it has actively helped customers increase their e-business readiness by enabling them to integrate their procurement applications with Dells customer-facing systems 


-  billion in 2001 from e-business ,  but it may be limited in its drive to find more savings by the lack of readiness of many of its customers and suppliers 


-  As  whole ,  then ,  the e-business model we have described here requires both top-down and bottom-up approaches to the necessary tasks 


-  )  There are significant financial payoffs from e-business initiatives; however ,  companies must focus their efforts on specific areas to realize such gains 


-  ,  Our e-business value model conveys to management where to focus organizational resources by highlighting specific areas of opportunity 


-  In particular ,  the model emphasizes that to achieve operational excellence and subsequent financial gains ,  managers must evaluate how processes align with e-business transformation ,  while encouraging the participation of suppliers ,  customers and internal constituents
