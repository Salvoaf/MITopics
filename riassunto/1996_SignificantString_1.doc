-  We propose that unethical business decisions may stem not from the traditionally assumed trade-off between ethics and profits or from  callous disregard of other peoples interests or welfare ,  but from psychological tendencies that foster poor decision making ,  both from an ethical and  rational perspective 


-  We cannot forecast the ethical landscape in coming years ,  nor do we think that it is our role to provide moral guidance to executives 


-  There are new theories about how easily our preferences can be influenced by the consequences we consider and the manner in which we consider them 


-  Finally ,  there has been important new research into the dimensions along which people think that they are different from other people ,  which helps explain why people might engage in practices that they would condemn in others 


-  ,  Finally ,  we all correctly believe that we are unique individuals 


-  If most of the executives in an organization think that they are in the upper 10 percent of the talent distribution ,  there is the potential for pervasive disappointment 


-  ,  Successful executives must have accurate knowledge of their world 


-  If they lack this knowledge ,  they must know how to obtain it 


-  There are three components to our theories of the world: the consideration of possible consequences ,  the judgment of risk ,  and the perception of causes 


-  ,   principle in ecology that Hardin has called the First Law of Ecology is ,  simply stated ,  You can never do just one thing 


-  Their deliberations gave no consideration to their customers interests 


-  The Pinto decision proved  colossal embarrassment to Ford; when the documents were released ,  the effort to conceal the decision failed ,  and public opinion ,  fueled by Ralph Naders book Unsafe at Any Speed ,  ran deeply and strongly against Ford 


-  Lets first consider these two scenarios: ,  These decision makers are grasping for certainty in an uncertain world 


-  It is simply foolish to ignore risk on ones own behalf ,  but it is unethical to do so on behalf of others 


-  ,  There are some good reasons why people underestimate the importance of chance 


-  When the market goes up on five consecutive days ,  people find  reason or cause that makes the world seem deterministic  ( for example ,   favorable economic report was published )  


-  ,  We believe in  deterministic world in some cases because we exaggerate the extent to which we can control it 


-  The illusory sense that  bet may influence the outcome is more acute for future than for past events 


-  ,  The illusion of control undoubtedly plays  large role in many business decisions 


-  ,  One common response to the assertion that executives underestimate the importance of random events is that they have learned through experience how to process information about uncertainty 


-  In situations in which our expectations or predictions were wrong ,  we often misremember what our expectations ,  in fact ,  were 


-  ,  We fail to appreciate the role of chance if we assume that every event that occurred was ,  in principle ,  predictable 


-  implies the belief that some future outcome was inherently knowable ,   belief incompatible with the fact that essentially random events determine many outcomes 


-  ,  Uncertainty and risk are facts of executive life 


-  That answer implies that we should devote all our efforts to highway improvement ,  cures for cancer ,  reducing product risks ,  and so on ,  to the exclusion of productivity 


-  There is  20 percent chance that the chemicals in your companys plant might be causing ten cancer-related illnesses per year 


-  There is  10 percent chance that the chemicals in your companys plant might be causing ten cancer-related illnesses per year 


-  The preference for certainty suggests that  firm might be willing to spend more money to achieve  smaller risk reduction if that smaller reduction totally eliminated the risk 


-  This finding probably occurs because the cure rate induces people to think of the cure  (  good thing )  ,  whereas an equivalent description in terms of failures induces people to think of failures  ( not  good thing )  


-  ,   less obvious effect has been found with regard to the framing of risks 


-  ,  Which plan would you select? There are  number of things to consider in evaluating these options 


-  For example ,  how will each action affect the union? How will each plan influence the motivation and morale of the retained employees? What is the firms obligation to its shareholders? While all these questions are important ,  another important factor influences how executives respond to them 


-  Reconsider the problem ,  replacing the choices provided above with the following choices 


-  ,  Now which plan would you select? Close examination of the two sets of alternative plans finds the two sets of options to be objectively the same 


-  For example ,  saving one of three plants and  , 000 of  , 000 jobs  ( plan  )  offers the same objective outcome as losing two of three plants and  , 000 of  , 000 jobs  ( plan  )  


-  Likewise ,  plans  and  are objectively identical 


-  While the two sets of choices are objectively the same ,  changing the description of the outcomes from jobs and plants saved to jobs and plants lost is sufficient to shift the prototypic choice from risk-averse to risk-seeking behavior 


-  When thinking about layoffs ,  for instance ,  most employees surely focus on their potential job loss 


-  If different stakeholders have different frames ,  the potential for moral disagreement is great 


-  As we mentioned earlier ,  every morning were given  reason for why the stock market rose ,  fell ,  or stayed the same ,  thus reinforcing the theory that the world is deterministic 


-  We tend to blame people because it is easy to imagine them having done something to undo or prevent the accident 


-  From an engineering viewpoint ,  what is easier to change  warning lights or periodic drowsiness? ,  Theories about causes often lead people to disagree ,  because ,  as McGill has pointed out ,  they are explaining different events 


-  Sears acknowledged that there had been some isolated abuses but denied that the problem was widespread 


-  These causes answer the question ,  Why did Jack do this ,  while others did not? Are there changes in Jacks situation that can explain his misconduct? Why did Jack do this now ,  when he did not do it earlier? is another way to construe this question 


-  In many cases ,  something like the method of compensation appears in the background 


-  If an employee behaves dishonestly ,  we tend to contrast him or her with honest workers ,  rather than ask if there is something encouraging dishonesty 


-  In many other situations ,  in which expectations and duties are not as well defined as they were with the Herald ,   failure to take an action is used to shield persons from causal and ,  hence ,  moral responsibility 


-  Is  public health official who decides not to authorize mandatory vaccinations responsible for the deaths of those who succumb to the disease?11 Is the executive who fails to disclose his knowledge of  colleagues incompetence responsible for the harm that the colleague causes the firm? Many people would answer these questions in the negative ,  largely because they perceive that the immediate cause of the deaths or harm is the virus or incompetence 


-  We probably cannot escape the sense that our native tongue is natural while other languages are artificial ,  that our food is normal while others are exotic ,  or that our religion is the true one while others are misguided 


-  We must merely believe that our own group is superior ,   belief that is often actively and officially encouraged by the groups in question and that most of us find all too easy to maintain 


-  We may not wish them harm but would not go out of our way to help them 


-  ,  Ethnocentric thinking exaggerates the differences between us and them in ways that can expose leaders to the risk of making ethically unsound decisions 


-  They seem to believe that the enemys spirit can be broken by  prolonged artillery or bombing attack and associated deprivations 


-  ,  It is an error to think that the effects of ethnocentrism are always as momentous or conspicuous as in these examples 


-  This difference has important implications for banks that want to understand and correct the disparity 


-  We tend to think that our beliefs about groups are accurate ,  and we can often draw on experience to support these beliefs 


-  Think about the people whom you consider to be the most effective leaders in your company 


-  What qualities do they have that make them effective? For  purely historical reason ,  there is  good chance that the people who come to mind as effective leaders are men 


-  For that reason ,  many of the qualities you associate with effective leadership may be masculine 


-  If we form our impressions of what it takes to succeed by abstracting the qualities of the successful people we know ,   perfectly reasonable process ,  our impressions will have  distinctly masculine aura 


-  These decisions are stereotypical when they use considerations about the group rather than information about the person 


-  ,  One of the most effective strategies for combating ethnocentrism and stereotypes is to have explicit corporate policies that discourage them ,  such as adopting and publishing equal opportunity principles and constantly reminding employees that group-based judgments and comments are unacceptable 


-  Often ,  however ,  firms and their executives genuinely believe that they are being fair and just in their positions  ( and that others are biased ,  an illustration of the illusion of favorability )  


-  ,  Most executives want to act in  just manner and believe they are fair people 


-  Since they are also interested in performance and success ,  they often face  conflict between fairness and the desired outcome 


-  Furthermore ,  they may believe that achieving these outcomes is fair because they deserve them 


-  These judgments often reflect disagreements about deservedness based on contributions to the collective effort 


-  The researchers who did the study reported that they had to ask the questions carefully because spouses would often be amazed ,  and then angry ,  about the estimates that their mates gave to questions like ,  What percentage of the time do you clean up the kitchen?17 )  ,  One important reason for these self-serving views about fairness is that people are more aware of their contributions to collective activities than others are likely to be; they have more information about their own efforts than others have or than they have about others 


-  An executive who is offered  substantial bonus to misrepresent the financial well-being of her firm may feel proud of her honesty when she declines ,  but others may either not know of the temptation or ,  if they do ,  believe that she merely followed the rules 


-  Egocentric interpretations of fairness hinder conflict resolution because each party believes that its own demands are fair and thus is unwilling to agree to what it perceives as inequitable settlements 


-  ,  Most people are erroneously confident in their knowledge 


-  ,  To the degree to which people are overconfident in their  ( conservative )  risk assessments  in their beliefs about the availability of scarce resources or the character of people unlike themselves  they will fail to seek additional information to update their knowledge 


-  ,  Even if people acknowledge the need for additional information ,  research has shown that their process for gaining that information may be biased to confirm prior beliefs and hypotheses 


-  Suppose you thought the rule was the difference between the first two numbers equals the difference between the last two numbers  (  common expectation )  


-  The executive wants to and does believe that the grip is safe 


-  Second ,  he is unconsciously exploiting social politeness ,  because people are more likely to agree than disagree 


-  Will feedback help to eliminate or reduce these biases? We believe that feedback may provide only limited help because of the tendency to seek and notice confirming information ,  which forms an additional barrier to learning through experience 


-  ,  When we consider the combined impact of the three processes described in this section  the illusion of superiority ,  self-centered perceptions of fairness ,  and overconfidence  we can see the peril associated with erroneous theories of the self 


-  Improving the quality of decision making means ensuring that all the consequences of actions are considered 


-  It implies having accurate assessments of the risks associated with possible strategies and being attuned to the pitfalls of egocentric biases 


-  ,   general principle is that the types of flaws and biases we have discussed are likely to influence decision making more when decisions are intuitive ,  impulsive ,  or subjective rather than concrete ,  systematic ,  and objective 


-  Often ,  systematic procedures result in the same decision as more subjective ones ,  but the results are more acceptable because the process is viewed as objective ,  fair ,  and less subject to bias 


-  Reasoning by anecdote  for example ,  My engineering chief says he is convinced the product is safe ,  regardless of what the test results say  not only wastes resources expended to gather the data but also irresponsibly exposes others to avoidable risks 


-  To combat overconfidence ,  for instance ,  it is effective to say to yourself ,  Stop and think of the ways in which you could be wrong 


-   major difference between President Kennedys Bay of Pigs fiasco and his skillful handling of the Cuban missile crisis was his encouragement of dissenting opinions and inclusion of people whose political orientations disagreed with his own 


- 23 ,  One threat to rational and ethical decision making that we noted earlier stems from the untrustworthiness of human memory 


-  The first step in managing this threat is to acknowledge it 


-  This recommendation corresponds to  tenet of the total quality management movement  record keeping and benchmarking are central to measuring objectively how well  process is performing 


-  The project that worked continually with citizens gained their trust and support for the project ,  while the one that ignored environmentalists faced expensive legal challenges in court 


-  If an idea cannot stand the light of day or the scrutiny of public opinion ,  then it is probably  bad idea 


-  ,  As we pointed out earlier ,  you cannot always trust your reaction to  hypothetical test 


-  Its easy to say ,  I wouldnt mind it if my family knew that  misstated the firms income by $20 million ,  when this is ,  in fact ,  completely untrue 


-  In particular ,  we should ask whether the people with the most to lose would accept the reasons for our actions 


-  Self-deception being unaware of the processes that lead us to form our opinions and judgments  is unavoidable 


-  We think we remember things accurately ,  but careful studies show that we do not 


-  We think we know why we make judgments about other people ,  but research shows us other reasons 


-  ,  If we can accept the fact that the human mind has an infinite ,  creative capacity to trick itself ,  we can guard against irrational ,  unethical decisions 


-  We argue ,  in contrast ,  that unethical behavior in organizations is more commonly affected by psychological tendencies that create undesirable behavior from both ethical and rational perspectives
