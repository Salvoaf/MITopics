-  His research has proven time and again that we all are not the sensible decision makers that we might like to think we are ,  and his recent book on the topic ,  Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions  ( HarperCollins ,  2008 )  ,  debuted on The New York Times Best Seller list when it was released earlier this year 


-  ,  Arielys insights should make executives think twice about the wisdom of the decisions they regularly make  as well as the inner processes they rely on to make those decisions 


-  Why ,  for example ,  will managers veto  10% cost increase for  $1 million project while thinking nothing of  1% overrun on  $10 million budget  even though the actual amount is the same? Why will they often agonize trying to choose between two close candidates for  job when theyre frequently better off just flipping  coin? Why do they try to dominate  market when ,  in fact ,   product monopoly sometimes leads only to consumer confusion ,  resulting in slow sales? ,  Recently ,  Ariely sat down with Alden  


-  Specifically ,  Ariely explains why  products price must take into account various irrational human behaviors ,  including the principles of anchoring  ( when the initial price of something has undue influence on our future decisions )  and relativity  ( when we infer the value of  product from the prices of similar offerings )  


-  ,  SMR: Your research suggests that ,  when selling  new product ,  companies should always compare it with something that the customer is already familiar with ,  even if the product is so novel that there really isnt something similar on the market 


-  ,  Ariely: Absolutely ,  for two reasons 


-  First ,  without such comparison ,  the space for  new product in peoples minds is ill-defined ,  making it very hard for people to figure out how to place  value on something 


-  We just dont know how to value things in isolation 


-  How many times  day do we really want to contemplate buying something by analyzing everything ,  thinking about the opportunity cost and so on? So we rely on our past decisions ,  including comparisons to other products 


-  ,  Ariely:  am not sure  like the word lazy ,  but ,  in general ,  thinking is difficult ,  and we try not to overdo it 


-  If companies want to understand how people make decisions about their products ,  they have to take such decision processes into account 


-  In the second ,  people will think its  great deal 


-  ,  Ariely: Yes ,  and the thing you need to understand is that that definition will last for  long ,  long time 


-  Now ,  this could have been  mistake ,  but it also could have been  smart trick because the question to the consumer at that time was ,  what is the comparison price? All of  sudden ,  something can look like  great deal at $400 when it was $600 just  few weeks earlier 


-  But the initial $600 price and then the $400 helped ,   think ,  create  very high price point in peoples minds 


-  And now that the iPhone is being offered at $200 ,  it looks like  fantastic deal because we still have these very high prices sticking in our minds 


-  ,  Ariely: We can argue whether Steve Jobs made  mistake or whether he is very clever 


-   think its interesting to think about it in this way: You introduce something at  very high price point ,  you create  value statement ,  and then you say ,  Sorry ,   didnt mean it 


-  But still the high price point is stuck in peoples minds; everybody remembers it was $600 


-  ,  SMR: On the other hand ,  what about companies that set the initial price of something too low ,  even offering  product or service for free in order to encourage people to use it? Isnt that why so many online publishers are facing such great difficulties ,  because they initially offered their content for free and then consumers couldnt move past that anchoring point? ,  Ariely: The truth of the matter is that its very hard to realize the value of something even after youve used it 


-  How valuable is it to you? Sure ,  if something is free then people will start using it 


-  But what companies dont realize is that the mapping of utility to money is very difficult 


-  In fact ,  pricing has the power to affect  customers perceived value of products 


-  ,  SMR: Is price like  product feature then? ,  Ariely: Thats  good way to think about it 


-  If something is cheap we expect it to be cheap ,  and the amazing thing is that we can even experience it as cheap 


-  If you got  discount for something ,  every time something un-perfect happened you might say ,  Oh ,  its because the product was cheap 


-  ,  SMR: So managers need to consider how they want their product to be perceived when setting its price 


-  ,  Ariely: If youre the cheap product in the market and you want that image ,  theres no problem 


-  But if you want  different image ,  you should consider very carefully your pricing strategies 


-   think the new price for the iPhone is too cheap 


-  But all of  sudden you can buy the phone for $200 and  think that this price will diminish the value of this amazing touch screen 


-  ,  SMR: So the cheaper price will affect how consumers experience the iPhones touch screen? ,  Ariely:  used to think of that touch screen as an amazingly expensive feature 


-  Now  think of it as  much cheaper feature 


-  The interesting thing here is that ,  when people dont think about it ,   pricing discount translates into lower efficacy 


-  But if we get them to think about it carefully ,  it doesnt have that effect 


-  ,  SMR: So with the iPhone ,  because Apple didnt make greater efforts to explain the lower price ,  consumers will somehow think the quality is less than that of the original product? ,  Ariely: Thats right ,  at least in some very primitive ,  nondeliberative sense 


-  People would not say ,  Apple made this worse ,  but theres  chance that they would think of it as second best 


-  ,  SMR: Should Apple have better explained the lower pricing ,  for example ,  by saying that the manufacturing cost has decreased because of the technology learning curve ,  all the while stating that the quality of the product is the same? In other words ,  you want customers to consciously think of why  product is now being offered at  discount 


-  That is ,  does Coke need Pepsi and Pepsi need Coke because they provide that frame of reference for each other? ,  Ariely: When your product is by itself ,  consumers will have difficulty evaluating it ,  and as  consequence ,  fewer people will buy it 


-  You can think about many products like that 


-  ,  SMR: So would you agree with  GM strategy in which you create all these product brands so that consumers can compare Buicks with Chevrolets and Cadillacs and Pontiacs and so on? ,  Ariely:  am not sure about that ,  because what you dont want to do is create too many choices and get consumers confused 


-  ,  SMR: In other words ,  people are easily confused? ,  Ariely: But there are two important factors 


-  But confusion is very important when theres  default of not doing something ,  such as when an item is not on your shopping list 


-  The second factor is the amount of effort that people want to put into making  choice 


-  But if youre dealing with something important ,  people will pay more attention ,  and theyll be more likely to persist despite their confusion 


-  ,  SMR: And  suppose another factor is the ease of comparison 


-  How difficult is it to compare products? How much do you need to know to compare them? How important is the decision ,  and what is the default? All of those factors together will determine the complexity of  decision 


-  Again ,   said ,  Im very happy for you ,  but that is not an answer 


-  ,  SMR: It probably didnt cross the guys mind that Bains interviewing process might be invalid 


-  The guy got really upset with me ,  but the point  was trying to make was actually very basic: To really test how good their interviews are ,  they must check their prediction ability and ,  even better ,  they should from time to time hire people that they dont think will work out well 


-  ,  Ariely: Yes ,   think they have to start being more rigorous and systematic in their approach 


-  Now think about that: Its incredibly expensive to put  pilot through training ,  and every year they take  few people who didnt do well on the test and put them through that training 


-  Its exactly like hiring the people you think will not do well 


-  In one sense ,  its very counterintuitive 


-  ,  SMR: Thats  tough sell for companies  having them purposely hire people whom they think will do poorly  because bad employees can wreak so much havoc 


-  Youve played with the first type the whole night ,  so you know how much money it gives ,  but youve played with the second type only  few times 


-  So you dont know if the first type is better than the second 


-   think many companies have  short-term perspective ,  and thats why they dont invest in learning 


-  But the other thing to understand is that current hiring practices are awful; many companies might be better off going to  university like MIT and hiring students at random 


-  You showed that when  waiter takes orders sequentially from people in  group ,  after the first person orders  particular entree ,  the others in the party will be less likely to order that dish because they dont want to be seen as copycats 


-   wonder if that happens  lot in business meetings in which people give their opinions about  proposal by going sequentially around  table 


-  Its unbelievable how everybody feels the need to say something in meetings ,  even if its only very slightly different from what someone else said 


-  We wanted to investigate why ,  when you take good people and put them in  room ,  they make bad decisions as  group 


-  And the question is: How can you use technology to prevent that? How can you ,  for example ,  eliminate excessive conformity and obedience? ,  SMR: What does the software do? ,  Ariely: We had multiple versions ,  and one of the problems we investigated was the presence of an authority figure: When your boss says ,  I think we should do  ,  how likely are you to vote for  different option? Another thing we investigated was conformity: If five people say the same thing ,  will you be more likely to follow suit? So we created basic technological tools for voting 


-  For example ,   might be able to allocate my vote to you if  think youre  big expert on the particular topic at hand ,  but you wouldnt know that  had allocated my vote to you ,  etc 


-  ,  SMR: Did the software allow changes in the rules so that ,  instead of needing  majority of votes ,  you need three-quarters? ,  Ariely: Exactly ,  yes 


-  For example ,  we could present them with 10 things they needed to make decisions about and give them 100 points ,  and then they would have to allocate those points among the 10 issues 


-  ,  Ariely: Groups are important to share information ,  but when people need to make decisions ,  theyre not good 


-  We thought the software was very good ,  but no company ever wanted to try it with us in  real experiment 


-  ,  SMR: Why the reluctance? ,  Ariely:  think group decision making is one of those things that companies have huge confidence in 


-  Groups are not helpful in getting people to make better decisions ,  but theyre helpful in getting people to feel more confident about the decision theyve made 


-  You havent actually said anything that she doesnt know 


-  And  think that while everybody understands this in their social lives ,  they dont understand it in the employer-employee relationship 


-  And  think its  crucial lesson 


-  On the other hand ,  they want to motivate employees to go beyond the call of duty so they want workers to feel that the employer-employee relationship is more than just economic 


-  And if  dont pay you with cash in an envelope but simply move the money to your bank account ,  then the relationship is even less direct 


-  Now presumably you would be better off taking the cash ,  because you might want to go to the North Carolina shore instead of to the Bahamas 


- com? Under which condition would you be more loyal?  think its the vacation ,  and thats the trick: There are things that are financially inefficient but are socially and motivationally efficient 


-  By the way ,  isnt it amazing that the thing that Microsoft fears most is an organization of people who work for free?  mean ,  just think about that 


-  ,  SMR: So do you think that businesses will move toward organizations like Linux that are more community based than market driven? ,  Ariely:  think its about the meaning that people derive from their labor 


- 40 for the next and so on ,  and people could decide when they wanted to stop 


-  In essence we were asking ,  what is the marginal value of your labor? For one group of people ,  when they finished  robot wed ask ,  Do you want another? and if they did ,  wed give them the parts and take the completed robot and put it in  box 


-  The other people were able to find small meaning in even something as trivial as building Lego robots ,  and that sustained them 


-  Now ,  that for me is an incredible insight  to understand how little meaning you need to add to peoples work to increase their motivation 


-  You want employees to feel that theyre doing something important ,  that theyre making  contribution ,  and from that perspective Linux has  much better story than Microsoft
