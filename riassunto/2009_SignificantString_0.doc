- Sustainability is garnering ever-greater public attention and debate 


-  The subject ranks high on the legislative agendas of most governments; media coverage of the topic has proliferated; and sustainability issues are of increasing concern to humankind 


-  ,  However ,  the business implications of sustainability merit greater scrutiny  and scrutiny of  different kind than the green-oriented focus thats most common 


-  Will sustainability change the competitive landscape and reshape the opportunities and threats that companies face? If so ,  how? How worried are executives and other stakeholders about the impact of sustainability efforts on the corporate bottom line? What  if anything  are companies doing now to capitalize on sustainability-driven changes? And what strategies are they pursuing to position themselves competitively for the future? ,  To begin answering those questions ,  we conducted  year-long inquiry that involved in-depth interviews with more than 50 global thought leaders ,  followed by the Business of Sustainability Survey of more than  , 500 worldwide executives and managers about their perspectives on the intersection of sustainability and business strategy ,  including their assessments of how their own companies are acting on sustainability threats or opportunities right now 


-  The survey will be conducted annually ,  in order to track changes in how companies are thinking and acting 


-  ,  This article can contain only the high-level findings and highlights from the interviews and survey 


-  For  complete look at the survey results as well as more extensive reporting and analysis ,  go online to the MIT Sloan Management Reviews Web-based guide to all the articles ,  results and data reports yielded by the project 


-  ,  There ,  as here ,  you will find not only answers but ,  equally interestingly ,  questions that are coming to the fore as sustainability concerns of all kinds reshape management practices and strategy 


-  Why is the business case for sustainability-related investments hard to build ,  even when opportunities seem apparent? What particular capabilities and characteristics must organizations cultivate in order to compete most effectively in the new ,  sustainability-altered landscape? How will the relationships among companies ,  communities ,  individuals and governments be changed by sustainability issues ,  and what opportunities does that present? ,  First ,  though ,  the immediate questions: What are executives thinking and doing about sustainability-driven concerns right now? Whats impeding their attempts to both capitalize on opportunities and defend against threats? ,  Heres what our thought-leader interviews and corporate executive survey revealed 


-  ,  When managers and executives refer to sustainability ,  what do they mean  and how important do they think it is? The survey revealed that there is no single established definition for sustainability 


-  Companies define it in myriad ways  some focusing solely on environmental impact ,  others incorporating the numerous economic ,  societal and personal implications 


-  Yet while companies may differ in how they define sustainability ,  our research indicates that they are virtually united in the view that sustainability ,  however defined ,  is and will be  major force to be reckoned with  and one that will have  determining impact on the way their businesses think ,  act ,  manage and compete 


-  Over 92% of respondents told us that their company was already addressing sustainability in some way 


-  ,  Nor does sustainability appear to be an ephemeral strategy concern ,  if we can judge by how little the view of it has been affected by the pressure of the economic downturn 


-  )  ,  Indeed ,   number of thought leaders shared their belief that the downturn has accelerated  shift toward  greater corporate focus on sustainability  particularly toward sustainability-related actions that have an immediate impact on the bottom line 


-  At the same time ,  several survey respondents lamented having to meet higher than normal criteria for sustainability investments 


-  ,  Opinions diverge on some aspects of sustainability 


-  Although the points above reflect  strong convergence of views on the overarching question of sustainabilitys impact on business ,  significant divergence in opinion arose regarding particular aspects of sustainability 


-  ,  Self-identified sustainability experts viewed the topic differently than those who considered themselves novices in the area 


-  We asked survey respondents to rate their experience with sustainability by classifying themselves as either  sustainability expert ,  an individual with some experience or  novice 


-  In  number of cases ,  the perspectives held by these three groups were at odds 


-  ,  It is noteworthy that experts views on the points above were largely consistent with those of the thought leaders we interviewed ,  with experience being the common denominator between the groups 


-  Simply put ,  the more people know about sustainability ,  the more thoughtfully they evaluate it and the more opportunity they see in it  and the more they think it matters to how companies position themselves and operate 


-  ,  As an overall group ,  survey respondents held different opinions from those of the thought leaders we interviewed 


-  On average ,  the thought leaders had more experience with sustainability than the survey respondents ,  so it was not surprising that their views diverged on several aspects of sustainability  particularly on the topics drivers and benefits 


-  The major points of contention included the following: ,  By  wide margin ,  survey respondents identified the impact on  companys image and brand as the principal benefit of addressing sustainability 


-  ( See What Are the Benefits of Action? )  But thought leaders rarely cited this factor  ( or when they did ,  they described it as  second-order benefit )  ,  emphasizing instead  broad continuum of rewards that were grounded more in value creation  particularly sustainabilitys potential to deliver new sources of competitive advantage 


-  Several thought leaders offered other provocative ideas about the potential benefits of addressing sustainability 


-  For example ,  some thought leaders suggested that leadership in sustainability might be viewed as  proxy for management quality 


-  The group of so-called first-class companies in sustainability ,  as identified by survey respondents ,  is populated by the usual suspects often highlighted in business articles ,  reports ,  books and sustainability indexes 


-  In aggregate ,  these companies are demonstrating that  sustainability strategy can yield real results 


-  Our survey and interviews demonstrated that there is  large degree of consensus regarding the potential business impact of sustainability 


-  And our research further confirmed that there are stirrings of activity throughout the business realm 


-  On the one hand ,  more than 60% of respondents said that their company was building awareness of its sustainability agenda 


-  On the other hand ,  most companies appeared to lack an overall plan for attacking sustainability and delivering results 


-  Many of their actions seemed defensive and tactical in nature ,  consisting of  variety of disconnected initiatives focused on products ,  facilities ,  employees and the greater community 


-  While these efforts might be impressive on some levels ,  they largely represented only incremental changes to the business 


-  ,  Clearly ,  companies can do more to connect their stated intent in sustainability with business impact  and they can do it in  way that maintains explicit links to the bottom line over both the short term and long term 


-  But why arent they ,  given that they believe sustainability will materially affect their business? ,  Many thought leaders and survey respondents viewed sustainability as  unique business issue ,  both strategically and economically 


-  They embraced the following principles: ,  These principles make sustainability  uniquely challenging issue for business leaders to manage and address effectively 


-  Second ,  companies struggle to define the business case for value creation 


-  Our survey revealed  pervasive lack of understanding among business leaders of what sustainability really means to  company 


-  This shortcoming results from several underlying information gaps 


-  ,  All of these issues point to  critical need for  thorough and structured gathering and sharing of basic facts about sustainability as  first step toward helping managers to be more decisive in the choices they face 


-  ,  Some companies have difficulty modeling the business case  or even finding  compelling case  for sustainability 


-  Most survey respondents who considered themselves experts in sustainability ,  as well as most thought leaders ,  said that their company had found  compelling business case  one that reflected multiple tangible and intangible costs and benefits  for sustainability 


-  ( See How Sustainability Affects Value Creation for  summary of sustainabilitys potential impact when viewed through the lens of shareholder value creation 


-  )  ,  The majority of survey respondents ,  however ,  disagreed: Almost 70% of overall respondents said that their company did not have  strong business case for sustainability 


-  Of these ,  22% claimed that the lack of  business case presented their company with its primary barrier to pursuing sustainability initiatives 


-  ,  Why do companies struggle in their efforts to develop the business case for sustainability? Our survey uncovered three main challenges that trip up companies 


-  The first challenge is forecasting and planning beyond the one-to-five-year time horizon typical of most investment frameworks 


-  But in practice ,  calculating the costs and benefits of sustainability investments over time frames that sometimes span generations can be difficult with traditional economic approaches 


-  Companies find it difficult enough to identify ,  measure and control all of the tangible facets of their business systems 


-  So they often do not even attempt to model intangibles or externalities such as the environmental and societal costs and benefits of their current business activities and potential moves in sustainability 


-  Factors contributing to uncertainty include potential changes in regulation and customer preferences 


-  Strategic planning ,  as traditionally practiced ,  is deductive  companies draw on  series of standard gauges to predict where the market is heading and then design and execute strategies on the basis of those calculations 


-  But sustainability drivers are anything but predictable ,  potentially requiring companies to adopt entirely new concepts and frameworks 


-  ,  Many thought leaders and survey respondents with experience in sustainability believe that clarifying the business case for sustainability may be the single most effective way to accelerate decisive corporate action ,  since it gets to the heart of how companies decide where they will  and will not  allocate their resources and efforts 


-  Indeed ,  survey respondents overall cited outdated mental models and perspectives as the top internal roadblock to addressing sustainability issues 


-  ,  The third major obstacle cited is measuring ,  tracking and reporting sustainability efforts 


-  ,  Some of these barriers ,  it should be noted ,  will accompany any major change effort in corporate strategy and operations 


-  But they are intensified in the case of sustainability ,  given the topics unique economic and strategic challenges and companies limited experience with it 


-  ,  As they confront the barriers to pursuing and achieving sustainability ,  many  if not most  business managers are struggling to understand where their companies are ,  where they need to go and how to get there 


-  They do ,  however ,  share  consensus view that sustainability will have an increasingly large impact on the business landscape going forward 


-  Thought leaders and executives who self-identify as experienced with sustainability issues point out the following emerging realities: ,  The experiences of executives already wrestling with sustainability-driven business issues suggest that companies need not make large ,  immediate investments in new programs 


-  The findings reveal instead that what is essential is that companies start to think more broadly and proactively about sustainabilitys potential impact on their business and industry  and begin to plan and act
