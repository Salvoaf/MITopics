- Knowledge networks are collections of individuals and teams who come together across organizational ,  spatial and disciplinary boundaries to invent and share  body of knowledge 


-  The focus of such networks is usually on developing ,  distributing and applying knowledge 


-  ,  Knowledge networks are as old as human commerce ,  as knowledge was often implicitly exchanged in the production and exchange of goods and services 


-  However ,  in recent years ,  Web-based collaboration has streamlined the identification and distribution of codified knowledge ,  at lower cost and over greater physical distance 


-  The knowledge network has been trumpeted as  model for innovation and scale  one that capitalizes on the agility and reach of human connections while integrating practical insight into the day-to-day work of network members 


-  Some emphasize that members are simply linked together by interdependent exchange relationships while others call for formalized roles ,  routines and metrics 


-  Whats clear is that knowledge network leaders can influence members behavior through network design and facilitation 


-  And that can mean the difference between magnetism and fizzle ,  between knowledge sharing and hoarding ,  between inspiration and cynicism 


-  ,  We sought to better understand the leverage that network leaders have 


-  Much recent writing in both the academic and popular presses about knowledge networks has focused on their outcomes and products ,  such as knowledge diffusion ,  new knowledge creation ,  influence and intercompany and interpersonal connectivity 


-  However ,  there is considerably less attention paid to how leaders systematically initiate and monitor members values and behaviors ,  for example ,  by reframing inherent conflicts of interest 


-  The question we asked was: How do leaders balance emergent ,  voluntary interdependent exchanges with the practicalities of achieving goals? ,  Our initial research ,  funded by the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation ,  focused on how knowledge networks could improve the spread of evidence about childhood and maternal nutrition 


-  )  We used that research to develop  model of knowledge networks ,  and later validated our model in organizations outside the international health space 


-  These different examples provided  good test for the model: At ConocoPhillips ,  knowledge networks are an intermediate good ,   means to an end and  vehicle to create products or drive efficiencies 


-  At Womens World Banking ,  the creation and diffusion of knowledge is the product  the value Womens World Banking brings to market 


-  We realize that the future of our company will be born out of  web of human conversations ,  explained Dan Ranta ,  ConocoPhillips director of knowledge sharing 


-  Connecting our knowledge workers purposefully gives our company  greater opportunity to create regular ,  sustainable business value 


-  We wanted to know if specific purposes and named outcomes call for different network designs 


-  Is the networks primary purpose knowledge development  ( for example ,  through convening ,  brokering or funding knowledge creation )  or the diffusion ,  scaling and absorption of ideas by knowledge network participants? Depending on the answer ,  what leadership model and convening process work best? ,  Answers by knowledge network leaders ,  consultants and researchers to these questions of designing for outcomes fall into distinct categories 


-  We saw some network goals that were externally focused ,  collective and product-oriented  such as group coordination and knowledge-capital publication 


-  ,  When coordination is  key goal ,  the network coordinates and leverages members existing knowledge activities through its structures ,  incentives and norms 


-  ,  When learning and innovation are important goals ,  the knowledge network commissions ,  accumulates and distributes knowledge for its members consumption ,  or as  general public good 


-  Project Zero team members convene the knowledge network several times annually in Cambridge ,  Massachusetts  ( as well as asynchronously )  


-  Co-created knowledge products are then published outside the community for public consumption 


-  ,  When translation and local adaptation are primary network goals ,  teams join the knowledge network to identify and adapt knowledge to their specific local challenges 


-  They dont simply remix or reframe ideas but become networks themselves ,  supporting each other back at home through their common experience and vocabulary 


-  ,  When this is an important goal ,  individuals join the network to develop ,  accumulate and adapt knowledge to support their own and their colleagues work 


-  Support of individual members is the most common goal of the corporate knowledge networks we examined 


- org ,  founded in 2000 ,  is an approximately  , 400-member virtual knowledge network that individuals in the international development field can join regardless of their organizational level or accomplishments 


-  ,  Freedom for an individual to ask questions without manager scrutiny and peer criticism is  central goal of the knowledge network models for both ConocoPhillips and Womens World Banking 


-  ConocoPhillips ,  meanwhile ,  promotes network membership as part of the onboarding process for new employees; the companys knowledge networks help new and experienced hires connect up and down the ConocoPhillips hierarchy from the start 


-  ,  Meeting any of the four goals of  knowledge network requires members to act by capitalizing on the cohesion ,  conversation and connectedness of the network 


-  We sought to understand the larger effects that influence knowledge network performance 


-  Borrowing from the organizational learning field ,  we studied the knowledge network through the lens of what is called  leverage framework 


-  ,  Outcomes can be described as meeting the four knowledge network goals of coordination ,  learning/innovation ,  translation/local adaptation and support of individual members 


-  ,  Behaviors are those that are conducive to outcomes: cohesion ,  demonstration of trust ,  connection sharing ,  using  common technology platform and making investments in collaboration ,  such as taking time out to answer fellow members questions 


-  In  successful knowledge network ,  members identify with the network and its aspirations ,  readily share their connections inside and outside the network and are committed to moving knowledge sharing to the platform so that everyone can benefit 


-  For example ,  ConocoPhillips network members use  discussion forum called Ask  Discuss to ask questions and conduct problem solving through the platform 


-  Highly successful knowledge network leaders that we interviewed saw design as either positive leverage or an Achilles heel 


-  They explained the relationships between design choices and the dynamics they sought and took pains to influence those dynamics 


-  In fact ,  they saw themselves as social artists ,  continually tweaking the knowledge network design 


-  ,  Experienced knowledge network leaders that we interviewed endeavored to create  consistency between structures  ( such as operating model ,  charter and technologies )  and strategy  ( such as purpose ,  network composition and learning context )  


-  They used visible performance information and incentives  ( such as reputation ,  recognition and sense of belonging )  to inspire ,  motivate and redirect the behaviors of the members 


-  We identified eight design dimensions of knowledge networks 


-  ( See Knowledge Network Design Questions to Consider for the questions to ask about each design dimension 


-  )  ,  Successful knowledge network leaders can describe the mechanisms through which network activities will have an impact on members and organizations 


-  ,  For example ,  ConocoPhillips senior leaders have gone on record endorsing cross-organizational knowledge sharing of their Networks of Excellence as critical to innovation in the companys exploration and production process 


-  Outcomes can be solving  specific problem or combining forces and knowledge 


-  Similarly ,  Womens World Banking launched the design process of its Leadership Community by conducting consultations with microfinance leaders to determine which knowledge network goals resonated most closely with their needs and to model  core value and goal of the community  leaders as experts and drivers of their own learning 


-  High-performing knowledge network leaders we interviewed thought deeply about how to trade off showcasing experts with supporting members who were stepping into the vulnerability of learning 


-  The leaders did this with  deep understanding of the disparities of knowledge in their membership 


-  For example ,  they had experts share and mentor ,  with learners asking questions where there were clear knowledge differences 


-  ,  Knowledge network leaders position the knowledge network or network program among other operations or competing organizational models 


-  ,  By contrast ,  Womens World Bankings network includes Alumni Circles that are private ,  in order to enable senior leaders to freely share challenges they face within  trusted group 


-  However ,  when posting resources on matters pertaining to the whole community ,  members may  ( and often do )  share knowledge assets outside the Alumni Circles ,  for the benefit of all network members 


-  For example ,  there may be core team members  ( including managers of content ,  membership ,  events or measurement )  as well as small project teams or working groups that assemble for just  few months to complete  task 


-  ,  Operating models for each of the four knowledge network goals could be quite different 


-  Network processes balance ad hoc knowledge sharing with more explicit innovation ,  authoring and publishing 


-  ,  Network leaders understand how online and real-time or live convenings serve to build cohesion ,  connectivity ,  collaboration and engagement 


-  In our research for the Gates Foundation ,  we found that despite much excitement about social media and collaboration portals ,  network leaders and researchers named real-time human connections  ( meetings ,  conference calls ,  video teleconferences )  as prerequisites for trust building and knowledge sharing 


-  The company is using  feed of knowledge network content in day-to-day process applications ,  such as purchasing 


-  ,  The core team members for ConocoPhillips networks are asked to prod discussions ,  periodically nudging ,  playing back or translating ,  in addition to asking probing questions 


-  In network leader Rantas words ,  they draw out the know-how ,  know-what and know-why to help others solve problems and learn 


-  Leaders address these delays between knowledge network behaviors and impacts by having  map that shows the pathway between inputs and outcomes 


-  Incentives include the extrinsic  ( community celebrations or letters or appreciation directed to managers or network members )  as well as the intrinsic  ( learning something new or solving  problem quickly )  


-  High-performing network leaders manage to minimize bureaucratic review and tie performance to incentives quickly so that members feel pride ,  connection and even healthy competition 


-  Network participation and knowledge-sharing rates roll up to functional and business unit performance metrics ,  which link to  discretionary portion of ConocoPhillips employees variable compensation
