-  Lured by the opportunity to use customer data to build customized and profitable relationships ,  companies have invested heavily in customer relationship management systems that quantify the value of transactions 


-  However ,  most CRM systems have been used merely to categorize customers into segments based on their current levels of profitability 


-  Customer relationship management has devolved into customer profitability management ,   one-dimensional ,  company-centric practice based on economics and costs that provides little insight into why and in what ways people form relationships with companies and brands 


-  That lack of relationship sensitivity has precipitated  new trend in which many companies use their CRM systems to identify and fire low-revenue ,  high-cost customers 


-  In  recent survey we conducted of 900 customers ,  30% said that they knew someone who had been cut loose by  company with which they had  commercial relationship 


-  We are not so nave as to think that companies should refrain from analyzing customer purchase data or the efficiency of marketing dollars spent 


-  However ,  we have found that basic information about customer lifetime value can be  limited and even misleading indicator of the status and potential of  customer relationship 


-  Although CRM programs may prevent customers from taking their business elsewhere ,  they are less effective at identifying the reasons to encourage them to stay 


-  Ironically ,  CRM programs themselves may actually contribute to the creation of high-cost ,  low-value customers 


-  However you look at it ,  companies are doing something wrong 


-  ,   dramatic shift in perspective is required ,  yet for managers who are willing to think more deeply about the relating part of CRM and their own roles in creating or destroying value ,  significant opportunities are available 


-  ,  In an effort to develop  deeper understanding of consumers relationships with brands and companies ,  we studied people who were in emerging ,  existing and terminated relationships 


-  CRM programs rely on purchase information and do little to address deeper relational needs 


-  Second ,  because relationships come in different shapes and sizes ,  companies need to be cognizant of the requirements of diverse types of relationships beyond the loyalty ideal 


-  As much as managers like to claim credit for profitable relationships ,  they also need to be willing to look inward to learn why relationships break down 


-  ,  Contemporary CRM systems look at customers as consumers ,  monitoring their purchase histories and calculating costs to serve 


-  Although metrics such as acquisition and retention costs ,  cross-selling potential and customer lifetime value provide economic insights that can advance the company agenda ,  they overlook the fact that the customer is first and foremost  person into whose life  meaningful brand may come 


-  There is  big difference between  system thats attuned to purchase and demographic data and one that takes into account what individual consumers are feeling ,  what they value and how they conduct their days 


-  You can know  purchaser by collecting purchase and demographic data ,  but to establish  relationship you really need to understand what makes the person tick 


-  ,  To appreciate the importance of deploying CRM systems capable of finding meaning ,  consider the way Peapod ,  the  


-  Internet grocer that is  subsidiary of Royal Ahold NV ,  treated  50-year-old customer well call Brenda 


-  As Brenda explains ,  It was  contract of help 


-  She first learned of the change at 1:00 one morning when she tried to schedule an online order for pickup; the company replied ,  unable to process request 


-  Her feeling was ,  Dont throw money at me 


-  Show me  matter 


-  Contextual clues may be scattered ,  but if  company pays attention ,  it can leverage them to build stronger relationships 


-  Of course ,  companies need to be listening for the right kind of data 


-  But to achieve differentiated advantage ,  companies need more robust data to assemble  more complete story of peoples needs and expectations ,  and how the brand helps them live their lives 


-  Developing this understanding involves scanning for ,  listening to and interpreting the subtle signals that customers send during transactions 


-  Bean and American Express train customer service reps to capture notes about customer interactions and to convert the information into  broad contextual understanding 


-  Bean representatives often recommend particular purchases based on specific information that the customer supplies  ( for example ,  that her son is really rough on his shoes )  


-  By adding contextual data obtained when talking with customers or when shadowing purchasers through service interactions or store visits ,  companies can expand their customer understanding and improve CRM 


-  ,  However ,  true understanding involves more than just developing insights that are specific to purchase and consumption 


-  It also means developing empathy for the individuals broader emotional life and understanding how an experience feels from the customers perspective 


-  Yet Virginie also harbored concerns about privacy and safety: The fact that strangers were picking out her groceries ,  coming into her home and sometimes making comments about items she purchased made her uncomfortable 


-  In Virginies view ,  Peapod broke an unspoken rule of their relationship ,   rule the company was oblivious to because it neglected to consider her emotional life 


-  Her concerns were never uncovered in Peapods consumer research 


-  ,  How could Peapod have known about Virginies concerns for privacy when she didnt discuss them directly with anyone during their various interactions? It wasnt that Virginie was unwilling to talk about her experiences; she shared her stories freely with us on multiple occasions 


-  Recognizing the inherent risks of being in the dark about things customers care about ,  some leading companies employ innovative market research methods to probe hidden concerns 


-  Harley-Davidson ,  the Wisconsin-based motorcycle manufacturer ,  has professional ethnographers on contract who live the Harley lifestyle 


-  Whatever the method ,  managers who are serious about understanding their customers need to find ways that go beyond analyzing purchase data to illuminate peoples lives 


-  ,  Todays CRM systems recognize that there are different kinds of customers ,  and not all them are created equal 


-  But in basing market segmentation on costs and lifetime values ,  companies fall into the trap of building strategies on relationship outcomes rather than on the inputs that create customer value in the first place 


-  Some address emotional or social needs; others are more utilitarian 


-  Although the range of brand relationships is quite varied ,  most companies focus on loyal brand marriages ,  despite the fact that there are several other types of emotionally vested loyal relationships ,  including best friendships ,  addictions and flings 


-  ,  We have found that there is profit potential in many different types of relationships; the trick is to understand the specific relationship contract 


-  Although best friendships and marriages occupy similar emotional space ,  they follow fundamentally different relationship rules:  marriage is  socially supported contract to stay together regardless of the circumstances;  best friendship ,  by contrast ,  is based on mutual interests and is voluntary 


-  Marriage partners erect barriers to exit and consider it within bounds to try to change the other  actions that violate the core principles of friendship 


-  ,  For many years ,  Harley-Davidson attempted to nurture brand loyalty through marriages with its customers 


-  This shift dictated new rules of engagement ,  which have guided Harley employees interactions with customers: Friends are equals: never support or convey hierarchies of power or control 


-  Never convey that you do not know or understand the other ,  as this calls into question the very intimacy upon which the friendship is based 


-  Be there when you are needed ,  for whatever reason 


-  The new guidelines have had ripple effects on everything from direct marketing communications to program offerings ,  training programs for community field officers and the types of customer databases in development 


-  ,  Our research has helped us develop  clearer understanding of the guiding norms for other categories of relationships as well 


-  For example ,  best customers like to see themselves as special and expect to be treated that way; they often have  biased accounting of the relationship ,  believing that they generate more profits than they actually do 


-  ,  Given the array of relationship categories ,  what can leading companies do to negotiate and manage more profitable relationships with customers? First ,  managers need to have  good picture of the types of relationships in their customer portfolios 


-  CRM software and the customer data that feed it offer limited guidance on how to maximize value creation across different types of relationships: Most companies simply end up shifting resources away from customers with less revenue potential or high costs to serve to their more profitable customers 


-  To achieve real impact ,  managers need to know the types of relationships in their customer portfolio and the relative number of each type 


-  But motivating good customers and firing bad ones is just one aspect of relationship marketing  in our view ,  the easy part 


-  In our experience ,   high proportion of commercial relationships today are conflict-ridden ,  and when relationships become troubled ,  most companies are quick to blame the customer 


-  Effective CRM systems should help companies understand their own roles in shaping relationships ,  for good or for bad 


-  ,  Whether companies are willing to admit it or not ,  many unwittingly encourage bad customer behavior 


-  The telecom industry ,  for example ,  is famous for offering customers cash incentives to change providers 


-  At Peapod ,  delivery scheduling protocols and  growing customer base encourage customers to lock in delivery times ,  even if it means canceling at the last minute; that creates operational challenges for the company and increases costs to serve 


-  electronics retailer ,  looked at its role in encouraging customers to be bad 


-  Among the practices it identified were customers purchasing large quantities of low-margin products for resale; customers returning products only to buy the same items at lower used-product prices; and customers scouring the Internet for discounted offers so they could take advantage of the companys lowest-price pledge 


-  Best Buy management realized that blaming customers for these actions was unfair; after all ,  its own price promotions ,  store policies and sales tactics played an enabling role 


-  Its response was to revamp its product mix to deemphasize low-margin loss leaders and to redesign sales promotions to deter customers who were fixated on the deal 


-  It also curtailed offers to so-called abusive customers ,  purging them from promotional mailing lists 


-  Rather than helping unscrupulous deal seekers take advantage of loopholes ,  it now tries to nurture more profitable partnerships with  broad customer base 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  accepting responsibility for bad relationships is unusual; blaming the customer remains the norm 


-  When an airline customer is unable to attend an important meeting or event because  flight was canceled ,  the airline doesnt apologize 


-  Its view is that the customer should have traveled the day before 


-  However ,  theres an ironic twist that is particularly troubling: When managers decide to crack down on high-maintenance or opportunistic customers ,  we found that in many cases the individuals they decide to target are the very people the company worked hard to cultivate through its CRM 


-  We call this the best customer trap 


-  Best customers are  natural consequence of CRM programs that see platinum customers as the Holy Grail 


-  They are created when companies reward good customers with discounts ,  shower them with attention and special treatment and permit them to break rules 


-  Over time ,  as their demands and expectations increase ,  they often become more costly to serve ,  and ,  taken to the extreme ,  they become  profit drain 


-  The best customer trap is an extreme example of companies punishing consumers for managements own lack of relationship understanding 


-  ,  We found  prime example of the best customer trap at Filenes Basement ,  the legendary Massachusetts-based retail chain specializing in designer labels at discounted prices ,  now owned by Syms Corp 


-  This feature encouraged customers to purchase items they liked when they saw them ,  in hopes that they might find the other pieces in another store; if not ,  they would return what they bought 


-  One customer well call Norma was  dedicated Filenes Basement customer for more than 30 years ,  spending hundreds of thousands of dollars by her account 


-  ,  Over the years ,  Norma had been one of the Basements most regular customers 


-  She was  member of the Insiders Club ,  an honor afforded to only the best customers identified in the companys CRM database 


-  ,  But when management analyzed the data about Norma ,  they saw something different 


-  In her mind ,  she was trying to help her company 


-  ,  Based on our research ,  there are  lot more bad customer relationships than there are bad customers 


-  The more the retailers CRM outreach acknowledged Normas status with special offers ,  the more she expected 


-  The company that built Norma into  platinum-level customer slowly transformed her into  high-maintenance customer who was increasingly expensive to serve 


-  ,  Norma was not  bad customer because she was unprofitable: Her lack of profitability was  consequence of the type of relationship Filenes Basement negotiated with her ,  not  cause 


-  In fact ,  management created an expectation that contributed to the problem ,  then failed to negotiate  new ,  more realistic relationship 


-  It failed to communicate that the relationship had become abusive and that  new relationship contract needed to be forged 


-  In the 1990s ,  when companies such as banks ,  telecommunications and credit card companies gained access to reams of customer data ,  the priority shifted to finding better ways to increase customer equity 


-  If companies are to maximize the value of their customer relationships in the future ,  they will need to redefine how they think about customer value and how they measure it 


-  Rather than maximizing revenues on individual customers and minimizing their costs to serve ,  companies may find it more profitable over the long term to focus broadly on managing relationship equity: the option value of the total portfolio of relationships that their customers represent 


-  From the customers in committed ,  long-term partnerships with the company to those engaged in shorter-term flings ,  managers will need to look at every relationship category in the course of designing  CRM program 


-  ,  Managing relationship equity involves four distinct steps: analyze the portfolio of customer relationships; develop  relationship portfolio strategy; design appropriate strategies for each type of relationship; and track relationship health and performance 


-  ,  Analyze the portfolio of customer relationships 


- 10 Some companies have found it useful to employ ethnography and in-depth interviews to draw relationship insights from the deeper meanings customers assign to product categories or specific brands 


-  For example ,  critical incident interviews can uncover rules of engagement and how customers react when rules are broken 


-  In addition ,  surveys in which people rate brands in terms of relationship needs and motives ,  relationship dimensions ,  strength qualities or more general relationship profiles can help companies specify relationship contracts for their brands 


-  Rather than developing customized relationships for individual customers ,  the objective is to uncover and create meaningful relationship-based segments composed of people who connect with the brand for similar reasons 


-   relationship segmentation for Peapod ,  for example ,  might suggest  multipronged focus on three categories of customers: partnerships ,  friendships and best customers 


-  BMW ,  for example ,  has an opportunity to tap into the various relational needs of different groups of individuals with specific car models; it could promote the 740 luxury sedan as the steady partnership brand ,  in contrast to the Z3 Roadster aimed at people interested in  more exciting fling 


-  Frito-Lay has developed  companywide program to expose managers to this kind of relationship-centric thinking 


- 12 By identifying customers by relationship type as opposed to economic profitability ,  managers can deliver CRM that follows the actual contours of the relationship at hand 


-  Effective CRM requires  deep understanding of relationship fundamentals 


-  Strategies for relating to customers must take into account the diversity of relationships the company is managing and adhere to the rules governing each type 


-  Obviously ,  rules can have significant financial implications; its important to know which rules increase costs ,  which rules increase revenues and whether its possible to establish policies that are beneficial to both companies and their customers 


-  To develop strategic ideas ,  managers can reverse-engineer their best and worst relationships to understand what makes them succeed and fail 


- 13 Customer blogs and discussion forums can provide further information about the emotional tenor of relationships ,  the degree of brand self-connection ,  the interdependence of the customer and the brand ,  and degrees of intimacy or commitment 


-  Moreover ,  the brands performance as  relational partner can be assessed by scanning customer service complaint logs or online reviews to see how people perceive the brands actions and to understand which actions are supportive of the relationship and which are causing concern 


-  Rising percentages of adversarial relationships might encourage companies to renegotiate individual relationships or perhaps to consider another approach ,  such as  new public relations campaign 


-  ,  ,  Companies seeking to improve the overall value of their customer relationships cannot rely on the standardized solutions and off-the-shelf analytics that have defined the practice of CRM to date 


-  For most companies ,  the transition to  relationship-based approach will require  significant shift in mindset and practice 


-  Managers will need to expand the type of data collected by their CRM systems ,  customize CRM solutions to the specific types of relationships the company is managing and retrain customer-facing employees to be sensitive to the relational clues they receive and send 


-  Companies need to stop managing for the immediate economic return and start focusing on how they can build the long-term value of their relationships 


-  Companies that ignore the challenges of relationship building risk losing valuable customers to more relationship-savvy competitors
