- Good strategic thinking and decision making often require  shift in perspective  particularly in environments characterized by significant uncertainty and change 


-  Asking what if questions about the future may create discomfort ,  since answers are often not obvious 


-  But asking such questions also forces you to step back and challenge current assumptions that prevent you from seeing breakthrough solutions 


-  This article builds on our new book ,  Winning the Long Game: How Strategic Leaders Shape the Future ,  by focusing on the art of asking pivotal questions to improve strategic decision making 


-  had the opportunity to buy or license Xerox Corp 


-  Little to answer  key question: If  more reliable ,  cheaper and faster process for photocopying were available ,  how many more copies would people make in  given year? Since copies in those days could only be made from an original specimen ,  ADL set out to estimate the number 


-  This huge ,  overlooked opportunity could only have been foreseen if different questions had been posed 


-  ,  CEO Larry Page challenges leaders to anticipate the future better by not just asking what is or likely will be true ,  but what might be true ,  even if unexpected 


-  ,  Question One: How well do you understand the implications of broad market trends and less visible undercurrents for your business and for upcoming strategic choices? Entrepreneurs like Elon Musk from Tesla Motors ,  Steve Jobs from Apple and Jeff Bezos from Amazon became known for spotting unmet market needs and figuring out how to serve them profitably 


-  Weve found that leaders can learn to anticipate better by simply being more curious ,  looking for superior information ,  conducting smarter analyses and developing broader touch points with those in the know 


-  ,  In an interview on CNN ,  Musk was asked where his forward-thinking ,  innovative ideas come from 


-  Ever since he was in college in the early 1990s ,  Musk had  vision of commercializing electric vehicles for the mass market and was questioning how this could be achieved ,  given the historic pushback against this idea 


-  chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada ,  known as the father of the Prius ,  had reservations about electric cars: Because of its shortcomings  driving range ,  cost and recharging time  the electric vehicle is not  viable replacement for most conventional cars 


-  The challenge was to demonstrate that electric cars can be  mainstream product and to reassure consumers that infrastructure can be developed to give them the freedom and reliability of  regular car 


-  Well before others ,  Musk saw the possibilities and asked different questions 


-  ,  Strategic leaders are focused on the future and are masters at asking discerning questions and exploring ideas and options that are outside the mainstream 


-  They are wary of status quo views and prefer honest ,  transparent questions that focus on how much ,  or how little ,  is really known about the issue at hand 


-  Many studies emphasize the importance of strategic thinking and anticipation ,  while also lamenting the shortage of leaders who do this well 


- 11 Follow events in other regions and sectors ,  even if they seem unrelated to your business at first 


-  How might you engage your existing networks more systematically to stay on top of new developments? Join interest groups in adjacent businesses or areas to expand your worldview and examine questions you dont typically consider 


-  ,  Question Two: How thoroughly have you analyzed major external uncertainties and future scenarios that could significantly impact your business decisions? Leaders must not only understand the deeper trends but also the key uncertainties that can rock their world 


-  He asked board members to identify potential alliance partners ,  decide on an action relative to competitors and assess their hospitals readiness to execute the plan 


-  ,  Even though good tools exist to raise important questions about future uncertainties ,  time-pressured executives occupied with putting out fires or exploiting short-term gains arent always receptive to them 


- 15 The intriguing question is not why top executives at large rating agencies failed to acknowledge the elephant in the room but why some investors and analysts spotted the elephant sooner than others 


-  Strategic leaders ask questions about the external business environment that have far-reaching implications and then ask team members to scout the periphery for emerging trends 


-  ,  Question Three: Do you regularly seek out diverse views to see multiple sides of complex issues ,  and do you purposely explore important problems from several angles?  persistent problem for many teams is promoting diverse thinking and creative friction 


-  Leaders must always ask if the team has sought sufficient contrarian input and been exposed to all sides of an issue before reaching  decision 


-  You really dont need another you ,  she said 


-  Staying open to different viewpoints helps ensure leaders are not unduly hindered by decision traps and can instead open their eyes to information or solutions that they may not have previously considered 


- 17 Constructive dissent and debate encourages people to reexamine current assumptions to make room for creative thinking 


-  They were asked to provide tough questions ,  offer honest critique and put alternatives on the table 


- 20 ,  The opposite of using questions to promote divergent thinking is to coalesce around shared viewpoints or succumb to groupthink 


-   Then  propose we postpone further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop disagreement and perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about 


-  Amazon forms task forces of just five to seven people ,  which makes it easier to test ideas and guard against groupthink 


-  Like GMs Sloan ,  challenge teams if they agree too fast on  complex issue ,  and ask them to reflect more deeply and develop constructive disagreement 


-  Before meetings ,  ask someone to prepare the case against the prevailing view ,  and rotate this role 


-  Train people to question the status quo and get them to appreciate the benefits of such questioning 


-  Holliday wanted to know why 


-  The answer wasnt complicated: Orders for new cars were dropping as the number of  


-  mortgage foreclosures increased ,  and the economy was going downhill 


-  To test his fears ,  he engaged his team and asked for candid feedback 


-  Unlike Holliday ,  most dont ask tough questions because they filter out weak signals that dont fit their mental models 


-  When faced with complex issues and conflicting information ,  it is easy to fool yourself: If you torture the data hard enough ,  it will confess to almost anything! At Eastman Kodak Co 


-  ,  for example ,  leaders failed to ask the right questions soon enough to fully understand and act effectively on the signs that photography was rapidly moving to digital 


-  Sleep on the data ,  since the mind continues to process information when resting 


-  Each time DuPonts Holliday took  break ,  and then reengaged ,  he got  deeper understanding and asked better questions 


-  Try to leverage the power of visual thinking 


- 25 ,  Question Five: Do you generate and evaluate multiple options when making  strategic decision ,  and do you consider the risks of each ,  including unintended consequences? It may seem obvious that leaders should examine multiple options before making  big decision 


-  Yet in the heat of the battle ,  few leaders actually engage in creative options thinking 


-  Research shows that when people feel pressed for time ,  they become less flexible and will much prefer certainty to ambiguity 


-  They asked  critical question in the midst of the life-threatening storm: Are there other options? Rather than getting ahead of the storm or racing to shore ,  the Midnight Rambler saw  third possibility: sailing directly into the storm 


-  But its crew was the only one to ask  crucial question in the face of the storm: Are there creative options? ,  Major disruptions ,  such as the appearance of new or unexpected competitors ,  often lead to quick action with little reflection  akin to the fight-or-flight response of animals 


-  This makes us prone to the traps of narrow focus and inside-out thinking that limit choices 


-  To be competitive ,  CEO Reed Hastings decided to unbundle the streaming service from the traditional model and offer it at  lower price 


-  By not asking the right questions ,  Netflix failed to fully explore options that might be more flexible and user-friendly 


-  Always ask ,  What else might we do? ,   


-  He advised his students to be sloppy enough in their lab experiments to allow for the unexpected ,  but not so sloppy that they could not identify the reasons for their anomalous results 


-  His peers considered him brilliant but somewhat sloppy 


-  Suddenly ,  he noticed something different about one of them: There was  halo where  blue-green mold appeared to have dissolved the bacteria 


-  Many biologists might have missed the small irregularities ,  but Fleming knew bacterial growths as an artist knows the color spectrum; in fact ,  he had occasionally shaped colonies of Staphylococcus into portraits of his coworkers 


- 32 ,  Learning from mistakes has much to do with  leaders mind-set and the questions that he or she asks both before and after an unexpected event occurs 


- 33 ,  Few leaders are willing to give more than lip service to failure; most corporate cultures view missteps as crippling rather than as sources of innovation 


-  Teach team members to ask questions that elicit learning rather than defensiveness 


-  If anything ,  we do the opposite 


-  Television game shows reward contestants who know answers to preset questions  and usually very trivial questions at that 


-  Having encyclopedic knowledge may win you  million dollars on  TV game show or yield good grades in school ,  but it wont necessarily make you successful in todays complex business world 


-  In changing environments ,  the big prizes go to those who ask better questions and learn faster 


-  In organizations ,  this comes down to leaders teaching and coaching others to think more strategically and ask deeper questions 


-  If you think like everyone else ,  you are likely to be average 


-  The best strategic thinkers ,  leaders and entrepreneurs distinguish themselves by how they frame decisions ,  the kinds of questions they ask and their mode of inquiry
