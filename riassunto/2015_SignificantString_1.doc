-  The initial offering was 21 


- 25 euros per share ,  which represented  premium over the stock price at the time ,  and the supervisory and management boards of Tele Atlas announced their support of the offer 


-  But in autumn of that year ,  Nokia ,  which at that point was  leading cellphone manufacturer ,  announced an agreement to acquire Chicago-based Navteq ,  Tele Atlas main competitor ,  for an astounding price of approximately $8 


-  The control of cartographic databases suddenly became  strategic imperative in the GPS industry 


-  In reaction ,  TomToms main competitor ,  Garmin ,  tried to secure its access to what was now considered as  strategic resource by announcing an offer for Tele Atlas in October 2007 at  higher price of 24 


-  ,  However ,  the Tele Atlas acquisition proved to be an example of the winners curse  the idea that winners in auctions tend to overpay 


-  Moreover ,  TomToms sales declined as the company faced increasing competition from GPS-enabled smartphones; during the period from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2013 ,  TomToms revenues fell more than 40% 


-  Wazes business model was quite different from TomToms: Wazes cartographic data was directly collected from the users ,  at little cost ,  and Google acquired Waze in 2013 for  price in the neighborhood of $1 billion 


-  Seven years after the takeover of Tele Atlas ,  it is clear that TomTom paid too much for  resource that seemed strategic and rare at the time 


-  In this view ,  the essential pillars of strategic success are nonsubstitutable resources and inimitable capabilities ,  and competitive advantage stems from unique and scarce resources 


-  ,  However ,  TomToms example suggests that competing on unique ,  rare and inimitable resources can be risky ,  because acquiring and protecting such resources can be costly; after all ,  most companies in an industry are seeking to obtain them 


-  While strategic resources can yield superior competitive advantage ,  their cost can sometimes outweigh their benefits 


-  In this article ,  we contend that ordinary resources may play an overlooked but important role in successful strategies  and competing with ordinary resources can be  valuable complement to competing with strategic resources 


-  )  ,  In particular ,  the emergence of new business models4 that leverage  vast array of ordinary resources  particularly multisided platform business models5  raises questions about the relevance of the traditional strategic focus on scarcity-based approaches and unique resources 


-  ,  For example ,  Airbnb connects an abundant number of people who want to source out their empty rooms to hirers who are looking for  space for  couple of nights 


-  Airbnbs user-friendly website ,  plain and simple business model and 24/7 customer care service allow people to make use of empty rooms in their homes ,   resource once considered as relatively useless or trivial 


-  Airbnb is expanding its global reach ,  with  presence in 34 , 000 cities and more than 190 countries 


-  Its growth rate is astounding: In 2012 alone ,  the number of listings on the site grew by about 250% 


-  Airbnbs rapid growth indicates that the hospitality industry  an archetypal capital-intensive business  can be disrupted with  totally different approach ,  one involving leveraging underutilized ordinary assets 


-  Given the growth of Internet-enabled platform business models such as Airbnbs ,  it seems time to highlight the strategic value of ordinary resources 


-  ,  The theory behind competing on strategic resources argues that performance differentials between competitors are  direct consequence of their resources 


-  Businesses that hold higher-value resources  ( people ,  technologies ,  reputation ,  partnerships and so on )  should benefit from  competitive advantage if they can manage their resources portfolio properly 


-  As  consequence ,  in order to keep their strategic value ,  resources must be neither perfectly imitable nor substitutable ,  and businesses must carefully defend them 


-  This approach explains many successful strategies ,  and its theoretical significance is unquestionable 


-  However ,  under certain conditions ,  relying too heavily on strategic resources may lead to several risks  such as the bidding war TomTom experienced 


-  Considering the potential of ordinary resources is  way to mitigate these limitations 


-  ,  An ordinary resource is  common resource on the market ,  generally perceived as neutral in terms of performance 


-  While ordinary resources are not ,  in and of themselves ,   source of competitive advantage and greater performance ,  they are generally required for the business to function properly 


-  Examples of ordinary resources include compliance with ISO standards in the automobile industry; stores and salespeople in retailing; and websites and logistics competencies in e-commerce 


-  ,  There is  strategic trade-off between the high-risk/high-gain combination of strategic resources and the low-risk/low-gain pattern associated with ordinary resources 


-  In some circumstances ,  the value of  strategic resource can be captured by the resource itself ,  at the expense of the company using it: For example ,  highly talented stars can use their bargaining power to demand higher compensation 


-  This is notably the case in global industries where the value generated by top talent is readily visible and  profusion of online rankings keeps raising the bar; examples include entertainment ,  professional sports leagues and CEOs of large ,  publicly traded global companies 


-  ,  For instance ,  consider the compensation of top British professional soccer players 


- 10 However ,  in the meantime ,  many of the top clubs in the English Premier League experienced financial losses and/or debt 


-  More than 10 years ago ,  Gary Lineker ,  the former captain of Englands national soccer team ,  was already observing ,  Of course ,  players are taking too much money out of the game ,  but they dont dictate market forces 


-  For instance ,   French film producer recently brought to the fore the idea that French actors were paid too much compared to the revenues generated by movies ,  even in the case of blockbusters 


-  This situation results from the organization of the heavily subsidized French film industry 


-  Many management techniques ,  from Frederick Taylors scientific management13 to modern knowledge management approaches ,  specifically aim at codifying know-how in order to avoid the pitfall of excessive dependence on the specialized knowledge and skills of particular employees 


-  Management scholars Sumantra Ghoshal and Christopher Bartlett once wrote that the key function of management is to help ordinary people produce extraordinary results 


- 14 Creating extraordinary results with unique talents may be great ,  but it is not the general rule in management 


-  The TomTom case demonstrates that once  resource is collectively considered as strategic in an industry ,  access to it becomes  vital challenge ,  and rivals compete to obtain it 


-  Companies whose business models are built around strategic resources are prone to allocate  significant part of their efforts to controlling and securing higher-value assets ,  as exemplified by numerous patent wars in the electronics or the pharmaceutical industries 


-  ,  In contrast ,  ordinary resources are inexpensive ,  and since most businesses overlook their strategic influence ,  their cost usually has no reason to rise 


-  They can be acquired and secured at  comparatively low price ,  and even if they do not provide competitive advantage on their own ,  they may contribute to it 


-  Day-to-day business performance does not rely on uniqueness 


-  If all competitors in an industry attempt to be unique and to possess nonsubstitutable resources and inimitable competencies ,  most of them will fail in that attempt 


-  In truth ,  very few businesses possess unique resources and distinctive competencies that fit the environments threats and opportunities 


-  Focusing exclusively on strategic resources does not explain the everyday performance of the vast majority of businesses ,  which remain profitable and competitive ,  even if they only possess relatively ordinary assets 


-  ,  Gathering  group of executives in order to help them identify the core competencies of their own business  even with the assistance of  series of practical tools such as an activity mapping or  benchmarking process  can be  disappointing exercise 


-  If some companies do possess valuable brands ,  highly talented people ,  deep pockets or patented technologies ,  it does not necessarily provide them with  true competitive advantage ,  for some of their rivals often boast  similar resource portfolio 


-  For instance ,  in the pharmaceutical industry ,  dominant players such as Pfizer ,  Sanofi or Roche possess comparable assets: Little is truly unique in their R&D capacity or in their marketing approach 


-  However ,  this does not prevent those companies from reaching excellent levels of profitability 


-  If the possession of specific resources is the ultimate explanation for success ,  innovation poses  problem: Breakthrough ideas and groundbreaking processes can threaten years of patient accumulation of talents and assets 


-  As  consequence ,   by-the-book implementation of  strategic resource-based approach can lead to inertia 


-  If you are convinced your company possesses unique resources and core competencies ,  you will very probably try to defend and leverage them  and hesitate to implement any disruptive innovation that could jeopardize your strategic commitment 


-  By protecting carefully accumulated rare resources ,  businesses may repel innovation and change 


-  As regards Sony ,  why is it not an absolute winner in the MP3 industry? Sony literally invented portable music devices and pioneered digital music 


-  However ,  in order to protect its unique resources provision ,  it also vertically integrated by acquiring what became Sony Music Entertainment ,   global leader in the music industry 


-  This bold strategic move had  drawback: Once it owned  large music company ,  Sony became very reluctant to enter the MP3 business in the early 2000s ,  for this industry   least at that time  was heavily relying on peer-to-peer piracy 


-  Nokia made  similar mistake: By preserving its unique competencies in design and logistics ,  it refused to admit that with the launch of the iPhone ,  Apple had changed the game from  battle between devices to  war between ecosystems 


-  ,  On the other hand ,  there is growing interest in frugal innovations16 such as the low-cost ChotuKool fridge ,   tiny refrigerator using thermoelectric cooling 


-  The belief in the superiority of key resources may lead competitors to focus too much on  small part of the spectrum of available resources ,  which may restrain their differentiation capability 


-  ,  Ordinary resources can play an important role in creating  competitive advantage in at least two situations: ,  We will now explore these two scenarios 


-  ,  Strategic resources offer limited benefits if you cannot gain value from them 


-  Business models focusing on strategic resources usually underestimate the necessity of ordinary assets ,  day-to-day activities and common talents you must leverage in order to achieve the full-fledged potential of the few strategic resources you master 


-  Moreover ,  companies are usually unable to develop or gather strategic resources in every domain of their business 


-  Ordinary resources are  cheap and necessary way to leverage unique assets  and thus allow replication and scalability 


-  ,  In particular ,  the use of ordinary resources enables the duplication of  business model in many business units and/or in many countries 


-  If such replication is  key success factor ,  as it is in industries such as retailing , 20 extending  business model through the acquisition of ordinary resources is much easier  and much cheaper  than implementing  business model relying on unique assets 


-  ,  For instance McDonalds Corporation is the worlds largest chain of fast-food restaurants ,  with more than 36 , 000 restaurants in more than 100 countries 


-  It has achieved this impressive growth in only 60 years 


-  While  top brand ,  efficient processes and premium locations for restaurants are often seen as the main strategic resources of the company ,  the replication of McDonalds business model is only possible because the model leverages relatively ordinary resources ,  in the form of more than  


-  Millions of young adults worldwide got their first entry-level job with the company ,  helping to keep wage bills down 


-  Far from being the talented human resources described in human resource management books ,  most entry-level McDonalds employees are not highly qualified ,  are part-time workers and can be easily replaced 


-  While scalability  ( the ability of  business to grow and develop without major organizational barriers )  may be related to cultural and cognitive dimensions , 21 it also depends on the type of resources on which the business builds 


-  When they are used to leverage strategic resources ,  ordinary resources allow scalability 


-  ,  Ordinary resources  not just unique ones  can yield strategic benefits and eventually become the basis of competitive advantage 


- 22 They can play  central role in the emergence of new business models 


-  )  This evolution may give rise to drastic changes in the competitive landscape in  given industry and eventually lead to the emergence of new markets 


-  For instance ,  the creation of the low-cost business model in the airline industry by Southwest Airlines in the early 1970s is sometimes explained by  unique blend of operational constraints and entrepreneurial ingenuity 


-  However ,  it also derived from the fact that Southwest Airlines was endowed with relatively ordinary resources  ( access to small regional airports ,  old airplanes and  comparatively inexperienced workforce )  while it was lacking what were perceived at that time as strategic assets  ( hub airports ,  connections ,  diversified fleet of airplanes ,  etc 


- 23 As the example of Southwest illustrates ,  it is possible to develop extraordinary performance and to gain competitive advantage by combining and leveraging ordinary resources in new ways 


-  ,  Crowdsourcing and crowdfunding strategies are two new types of business models based on the development of  mass of ordinary resources 


-  The ability to leverage massive amounts of comparatively ordinary talents and trivial assets through  platform and its ecosystem is not only  game changer ,  it questions the very principles of by-the-book strategies 


- 24 For example ,  the sharing of small units of available resources by the crowd is  successful business model for the crowdfunding company Kickstarter 


-  The concept of Kickstarter ,  where potential investors can invest as little as $1 to finance innovative projects ,  has created an industry of its own ,  and many competitors are jumping on the bandwagon 


-  In this model ,  it is  crowd of people ,  their abundant little pennies and an ample number of competing projects that yield success  not unique assets ,  high fixed costs and unparalleled talents 


-  This collaborative platform has developed  unique value proposition: to transform good ideas into ready-to-market products 


-  If Quirky brings  product to market ,  the inventor of the idea and the community members who contributed to its development  called influencers  receive royalties based on product sales 


-  ,  Examples like Kickstarter and Quirky indicate that strategic success can derive from  platform that draws on an abundance of ordinary resources 


-  This suggests that ,  instead of only focusing on unique resources ,  executives should also focus on leveraging  vast supply of more mundane talents 


-  ( See Can You Leverage Ordinary Resources? )  As physicist and Nobel laureate Philip Anderson wrote in 1972 ,  More is different: Beyond  certain size ,   system is endowed with new capabilities that significantly differ from what its various constituents can offer 


- 26 In business ,  the traditional strategic paradigm ,  based on the tight ownership of competitive-advantage generating assets ,  loses its significance when the wisdom of millions of people are involved ,  when ordinary resources are combined to achieve extraordinary performance 


-  Here are the critical points of the more is different pattern in business: ,   


-  Platform business models harness the hidden value of ordinary resources 


-  In their benchmarking processes ,  companies focus on new capabilities and new resources ,  but they do not investigate the potential value creation from ordinary resources ,  existing knowledge and ordinary talents 


-  However ,  our examples show that innovative entrepreneurs can develop new services from  mass of ordinary resources 


-  The main challenge consists in developing and growing an attractive platform  which in that case is  true strategic resource  in order to capture scattered ordinary assets and talents 


-  It is the combination of the platform and the mass of ordinary resources that create sustained competitive advantage 


-  However ,  as  strategic resource ,  the platform bears all the risks we highlight: Exploiting  vast amount of data ,  people or initiatives can be costly; rare talents can capture value; protecting the platform can hinder innovation; and  focus on the platform as an asset can limit executives perspectives 


-  ,  According to author Chris Andersons famous long tail concept ,  it is time companies stop focusing so much of their marketing efforts on flagship products to the detriment of more ordinary ones 


- 27 We make  similar observation about the resources portfolio: Businesses should consider the long tail of resources and stop analyzing their resources portfolio primarily through the prism of uniqueness and scarcity 


-  Whats more ,  taking into account the implications of ordinary resources opens new business perspectives 


-  Acquiring and mastering unique resources undoubtedly yields competitive advantage ,  but it can be extremely costly ,  and building barriers to imitation can erode your future competitive advantage 


-  Focusing on unique strengths implies specialization ,  and if you try to become  one-trick pony ,  sooner or later the trick will be matched by competitors 


-  Innovations can undermine the market value of  portfolio of superior assets 


-  By focusing on securing unique resources ,  executives may jeopardize the agility of their business and their ability to sustain  competitive advantage 


-  For instance ,  consider how the Wikipedia anonymous crowd ,  with its improvised bricolage ,  outperformed Microsoft Encarta and its deliberately crafted strategy 


-  ,  By eroding established barriers to imitation ,  ordinary resource-based business models may disrupt the business landscape 


-  Instead of promoting secrecy and defending industrial property rights at all costs ,  powerful incumbents should reconsider the advantages their distinctive assets provide and contest the taken-for-granted assumptions that underlie their success 


-  Overconfidence and inertia lurk in the blind spot of some resource-based strategies ,  whereas frugal innovation and crowdsourcing-based approaches are gaining increasing attention 


-  Rapidly expanding platform business models raise questions about this bias ,  and it is time executives start exploiting the long tail of resources
