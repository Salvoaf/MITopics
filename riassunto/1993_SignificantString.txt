- Academics ,  executives ,  and consultants are virtually unanimous on the importance of speed as  competitive advantage and the need to achieve more rapid strategic decision making: ,  Perhaps the most prevalent focus on speed has been in new product development 


-  Japanese companies have been heralded as models of how to achieve time-based advantages in reaching the market 


-  Honda ,  Sony ,  Canon ,  and Toshiba ,  among others ,  have been cited for their abilities to reduce product development cycle times and to introduce  constant stream of new products or product improvements responsive to evolving customer needs 


-  and European firms also have adopted  time-based philosophy and are substantially reducing product development cycles 


-  ,  Benetton is  well-known example 


-  Management has recognized the extreme difficulties of forecasting demand for style and fashion and has built the firms competitive advantage on  production and logistics system that is enormously responsive to initial seasonal sales data 


-  Hewlett-Packard is also cited as  leading example of reduced time to market 


-  The advantages ,  according to former Chief Executive Officer  ( CEO )  John Young ,  are not only faster market access but also higher quality and lower costs: Doing it fast forces you to do it right the first time 


-  Other firms capturing competitors attention for reducing development times include Motorola ,  General Electric ,  and Boeing 


-  These firms have substantially reduced their time-to-market objectives  sometimes slashing them in half 


-  ,  Executives interested in reducing their firms product development cycle times have  rich set of guidelines and experiences from which to draw 


-  Some excellent books and review articles are available ,  and  reasonably coherent set of recommendations can be made 


-  ,  Much less attention has been given to market penetration cycle time ,  that is ,  the amount of time it takes to reach maximum sales potential for  new product 


-   major source of competitive advantage thus remains: to achieve reductions in the time-to-market acceptance 


-  Objectives similar to those formulated for product development might be developed in this area ,  for example ,  to reduce the market penetration cycle time by half 


-  Figure  shows the time line of product development and market penetration 


-  ,  In an earlier era ,  it was possible to build market penetration gradually 


-  Companies could roll out products by region ,  and competitive imitation took time 


-  Packaged goods firms ,  such as Procter  Gamble  ( P&G )  ,  Kraft ,  and Lever ,  typically test-marketed and then engaged in product launches to  sequence of regional  


-  markets 


-  National distribution was reached within about eighteen months 


-  Entry to other markets  usually Europe  came much later 


-  Skimming involves initially setting the price high to skim profits and then decreasing prices gradually to reach broader markets 


-  Polaroid is the classic example 


-  Penetration pricing means setting low prices to sell at high volume and quickly increase market share 


-  Texas Instruments in calculators is the usual example 


-  ,  In todays competitive environment ,  however ,  the firm rarely has the choice of gradual market penetration ,  regional rollouts ,  or price skimming 


-  One exception may be under conditions of high patent protection ,  as in pharmaceuticals  ( witness Wellcomes controversial pricing strategy for its AIDS drug ,  AZT )  


-  However ,  even in pharmaceuticals ,  shorter product life cycles challenge the firm to achieve market penetration quickly 


-  The objective is to achieve steep acceleration of the sales curve before further technological change dilutes the products potential 


-  ,  Rapid sales acceleration is especially needed in technology-based products ,  such as computers ,  where life cycles for products such as workstations have been shortening; sometimes it may be  matter of months before new competitive products appear 


-   similar pattern of shortening product life cycles for products as disparate as cosmetics ,  food ,  and pharmaceuticals has been documented 


-  ,  The concept of  market window also suggests the need for rapid market penetration 


-  Abell has argued that there are often limited periods when the fit between the markets needs and the firms competencies are optimal 


-  In product categories subject to rapid competitive change ,  the market window may be open briefly before it is too late to enter ,  due to competitive preemption 


-  For example ,  Federal Express pioneered in the  


-  market with reliable expedited shipments ,  but it missed the market window in Europe by using  rather disjointed market-by-market strategy 


-  DHL and others ,  who had entered Europe early ,  had built an insurmountable lead that Federal Express could not overcome 


-  ,  The net effect is that in the marketplace of the 1990s ,  new products must be introduced almost simultaneously worldwide 


-  If an idea is put on display or in test markets ,  it is likely to be co-opted by another firm and to appear in world markets before the innovators product 


-  Indeed ,  many firms now find that the value of test markets is overshadowed by the risks of revealing ones hand to competitors 


-  Consequently ,  were seeing more controlled testing with lead users or simulated test markets in laboratory settings 


-  ,  The disadvantages of test markets and regional roll-outs are well documented in P&Gs entry to the cookie market with its Duncan Hines soft cookies 


-  This product was test-marketed in Kansas City with enormous success 


-  However ,  competitors could read the results as quickly as P&G could and before it could build adequate production capacity and achieve national distribution ,  Nabisco and Keebler preempted and reached national markets before the Duncan Hines product 


-  Their advantage was the ready availability of production capacity 


-  Although this then led to  patent infringement suit that was settled to P&Gs advantage ,  the Duncan Hines product lost its momentum by entering markets behind Nabisco and Keebler and never achieved the promise that the Kansas City test market suggested 


-  ,  How can firms reduce market penetration cycle times? Drawing from research in innovation theory and diffusion theory as well as management practice ,   suggest the following guidelines ,  subject to some qualifications 


-  ,  There are potential advantages and disadvantages of being first to market ,  but the evidence is in favor of being  market pioneer  ( see Table  )  


-  Many pioneer firms gain lasting market share advantage and may remain the top brand in their product category over decades ,  especially in consumer goods 


-  ,  Recent research gives some sense of the potential advantage of being first to market 


-  ,  using simulated test market data for frequently purchased consumer goods ,  found that the second firm to enter  market could expect to do only 71 percent as well in market share as the pioneer and that the third firm to enter could expect to do only 58 percent as well 


-  The value of market pioneering in industrial products has also been documented 


-  Market pioneers tend to achieve substantially higher market shares: the early follower can expect to do only 76 percent as well as the market pioneer and the late entrant only 51 percent as well as the pioneer 


-  ,  The sources of these advantages are the barriers to entry erected against later entrants  assuming the pioneering product successfully fulfills customer needs 


-  Consumer advantage emanates from the ability of the pioneer to achieve awareness ,  reputation ,  trial ,  and brand loyalty before other firms enter 


-  If the new product successfully fulfills customer needs ,  trial levels decline substantially for later entrants 


-  Similarly ,  the pioneer has the ability to choose the most profitable market segments and to select the optimal product positioning 


-  The market pioneer may also take advantage of the insights provided by lead users ,  who are positioned at the front of market trends 


- 10 Market pioneers may also gain access to the most efficient distribution channels ,  achieve greater experience and scale advantages to reduce costs ,  and be able to assume price leadership 


-  And market pioneers may have the best opportunity to set standards in industries such as communications ,  where standards are important 


-  ,  Nevertheless ,  the market pioneer also faces some potential disadvantages 


-  The most important ,  of course ,  is that most new products fail 


-  Interestingly ,  this is often not taken into account in extolling the virtues of market pioneering 


-  Additionally ,  the firm that engages in product development ahead of later entrants encounters higher R&D costs and runs the risk of entering the market with  suboptimal product or  premature technology 


-   common scenario is the early market entrant that achieves rapid market penetration but cannot hold it as superior new products enter 


-  For example ,  General Electric quickly moved to  second generation CT scanner and took the market away from EMI ,   small  


-  Finally ,  although product life cycles have shortened ,  the takeoff point for some technologies is still slow 


-  The takeoff of fax technology ,  for example ,  came many years after product availability 


-  Some technologies ,  such as multimedia  combining computers and videodisks in an interactive mode  have been heralded by many analysts but have not yet reached takeoff 


-  The danger is that the first firm to market may not receive  return on investment for many years in technologies that are slow to take off 


-  ,  The bottom line ,  however ,  is that the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages 


-  Nevertheless ,  each new product introduction is unique ,  and companies must weigh the pros and cons of first entry and delayed entry 


-  Large firms often have been assumed to have the capability to overcome not being first to market ,  but this philosophy seems to be changing 


-  General Electrics CEO Jack Welch now advocates first-to-market advantage ,  and even market leaders such as AT&T have found it difficult to catch up in communication hardware when they have lost first-to-market initiative in new product categories 


-  ,  Can  faster takeoff be gained by announcing the new product to customers before market introduction? High technology products are frequently  ( and confidentially )  preannounced to key accounts ,  but what about broad announcements ,  such as IBMs preannouncement of its PS/2 personal computer some months before general product availability? ,  In  recent survey of marketing managers across  range of  


-  industries ,  51 percent reported that their firm preannounced its last new product or service 


- 11 The timing of these preannouncements ranged from one month in advance of product availability to twenty-four months ,  with the median being between three and four months 


-   rule of thumb is that if the product is to be preannounced ,  the timing should be as far in advance as the length of the customers purchase decision process 


-  For example ,  if customers take on average six months to make  decision on  new machine tool ,  then the product should be preannounced six months in advance 


-  Otherwise ,  the firms first sale will be some time after the products market introduction 


-  ,  Although  am focusing on preannouncements to customers ,  in certain cases preannouncing might also have value for preempting competitors 


-  Alcan Aluminum of Canada recently announced the successful production of  new aluminum composite material and emphasized its production capability: A scale of this magnitude continues to place Alcan in  commanding lead worldwide in the establishment of aluminum composite production capability and plant capacity 


- 12 Similarly ,  Glaxo announced in advance of market introduction that it had made massive investments in buildings ,  equipment ,  and human resources for its new biotech drug colony stimulating factor 


- 13 In both cases ,  these preannouncements could be interpreted as directed at competitors ,  to discourage competitive entry 


-  They were also strong signals of market commitment to potential customers 


-  ,  Table  outlines the logic of whether new products should be preannounced ,  focusing on customer ,  as opposed to competitor ,  issues 


-  Three categories are germane: market factors ,  customer behavior factors ,  and value chain factors 


-  ,  Preannouncing is desirable if the firm has low market share ,  competes in an industry with low competitive reactivity ,  has strong patent protection ,  needs to establish market standards ,  and could gain image and reputation value by preannouncing 


-  ,  In many cases ,  the sale of new products depends on the participation and commitment of other firms in the value chain 


-  Preannouncement may be necessary in order to build this participation 


-  Preannouncement is advisable when the product needs complementary products or the firm needs to build supply or distribution commitments 


-  Thus ,  as  firm is reaching the market with an innovation ,  it must already be planning improvements and replacements 


-  ,  The need for unremitting innovation resides first in the competitive environment 


-  Inevitably ,  successful new products engender imitation 


-  Building barriers to entry ,  especially patents ,  is highly desirable ,  but the ultimate defense is  strong offense: constantly raising the innovative ante 


-  In fact ,  if the firm prematurely pursues scale efficiencies as  barrier to entry ,  it may simply lock itself into  technology that becomes obsolete as the battle moves to second- or third-generation products 


-  ,  Consumer demands also necessitate unremitting innovation 


-   new product may be enthusiastically accepted ,  but consumers inevitably seek improved benefits 


-  Despite the acceptance of Sonys Walkman ,  consumers wanted it even smaller ,  lighter ,  in alternative designs ,  for sports ,  and so forth 


-  If Sony had rested on its laurels for even  few months ,  competitors could have seized the initiative  ( and to some extent did )  by capitalizing on this escalation process 


-  ,  Benefit modification  ( or repositioning )  may also be necessary for some innovations ,  especially to reach broader segments of the market 


-  But when microwaves were repositioned as  secondary method of cooking and their size was reduced to fit on the kitchen counter ,  they successfully penetrated the market 


-  ,  Enhancements involve minor changes in established patterns of consumption or production ,  usually within one generation of technology 


-  Enhancements may fine-tune the product to customer needs or add value to reach new market segments 


-  In some industries ,  such as consumer packaged goods ,  most of the innovation that takes place is enhancement 


-  But even in high-technology markets ,  enhancements can be  major source of profits 


-  ,  Migrations involve more significant changes in established patterns of consumption or production ,  such as development of  new generation of technology 


-  For example ,  whereas first generation CT scanners could perform head scans ,  second generation CT scanners could perform whole body scans 


-  ,  Inventions create new patterns of consumption or production  the first CT scanner ,  personal computer ,  or jet engine 


-  Inventions can totally change an industrys competitive structure ,  although their occurrence is occasional and difficult to predict 


-  ,  Boeing has successfully managed the innovation continuum ,  as shown in Figure  


-  Boeings enhancements take advantage of evolving technologies  ( in engines ,  avionics ,  and metal composites )  to keep the product up-to-date and extend its capabilities ,  thus potentially expanding its opportunities into new routes or segments and keeping competitors at bay by revealing no weakness 


-  Boeing has developed  stream of new generation aircraft ,  from the 707 to the 777 ,  which is now in early phases of production 


-  Boeing cannot run the risk of being late to market with such an invention ,  much as the Douglas Aircraft Company was late to market with  jet aircraft ,  the DC-8 ,  after leading the market for multiple decades during the propeller era 


-  The cost for Douglas was  loss of leadership and acquisition by McDonnell to become McDonnell Douglas 


-  Undue focus on either end of the continuum may cause problems 


-  For example ,  the firm may focus only on enhancements and miss the change to new technologies 


-  It may focus only on invention and go out of business before the product becomes  commercial reality 


-  ,  Market penetration requires the blanketing of the market with multiple products ,  positionings ,  and sometimes even multiple brands to occupy the spectrum of segmentation opportunities 


-  Hamel and Prahalad give the example of Toshiba in laptop computers: ,  The objective is to occupy the market and leave little room for competitive entry 


-  One study gives evidence of the danger of neglecting market positionings 


- 81 between share of the car market and share of models 


-  automakers have reduced the number of models in their lines in order to pursue standardization and cost efficiency ,  they have failed to meet  full range of customer needs and thus have lost market share 


-  Neglected market positionings may invite competition and limit the firms ability to substantially penetrate the market 


-  ,   company may also need to launch multiple brands in order to penetrate the market 


-  IBM has finally succumbed to market pressure and introduced Ambra   clone of its own personal computer that does not carry the IBM name  to its European operation 


- 16 The IBM brand name simply cannot cover the entire market ,  including the low end 


-  Procter  Gamble is  master at using multiple brands to achieve high levels of market penetration ,  whether in detergents ,  soaps ,  or even diapers 


-  The basic premise is that market needs are diverse and that multiple brands are necessary to occupy the set of product positionings that are available 


-  ,  Of course ,  there are disadvantages to multipositioning or multibrand strategies 


-  The most obvious is cost: creating multiple brands is expensive 


-  Possible confusion is another potential disadvantage; customers may fail to appreciate the subtleties among multiple brands 


-  There is also the risk of the firm losing focus and diluting its core brands 


-  Finally ,  many firms have achieved success by dominating  segment or  niche and choosing not to compete in the total market 


-  ,  Successful market penetration also depends on the ability to develop global alliances 


-   single firm usually lacks the resources ,  talent ,  and time to penetrate global markets before  product loses its innovative advantage 


-  ,  Alliances can afford broader market access 


-  General Mills has formed  joint venture with Nestl to gain better access to the European market for its cereal brands  ( see Figure  )  


-  In biotech drugs ,  Genetics Institute has formed alliances with European and Japanese partners to gain access to their markets 


-  ,  Alliances can also deepen market access 


-  For example ,  both Roche and Glaxo sold Glaxos anti-ulcer drug Zantac in the  


-  market 


-  Glaxo did not have  large enough detail force to cover the market and capitalize on the opportunity by itself 


-  In workstations ,  for example ,  many analysts believe that only two or three standards can survive 


-  Thus Sun is encouraging competitors to use its SPARC chip ,  and IBM is entering into alliances with Apple and Digital Equipment Corporation to use its RS-6000 chip 


-   high-tech firm that is not aligned with one of the dominant standards is unlikely to be able to participate in the market at all ,  as software is not going to be written for minor players ,  and customers are seeking compatibility and low switching costs 


-  Each company is seeking alliances to gain the edge 


-  ,  Not only must  company establish rapid penetration ,  it must also develop  tracking and diagnostic system to measure its success 


-  The key to rapid sales acceleration is moving customers quickly through the purchase decision process 


-  The company must be capable of tracking each customer  ( or segment of customers )  and monitoring progress toward purchase 


-  The basic process is as follows: When  new product is introduced ,  the firm must  (  )  build awareness among potential customers ,  (  )  move these potential customers to  favorable attitude toward the product ,  (  )  encourage trial ,  and  (  )  achieve purchase  ( repeat purchase ,  in most cases )  


- 17 Of course ,  sometimes phases are skipped or others added 


-  For example ,  marketers may provide free samples ,  especially in consumer goods ,  to short-circuit the decision process 


-  ,  It is critically important to track potential customers over time 


-  The firm needs to know ,  at any given moment ,  what percentage of the market has reached each stage 


-  Consider the introduction of  new product to the market on  January 1993 


-  ,  In this scenario ,  sales are being held back because of the inability to develop awareness ,  which is at the 35 percent level among potential customers 


-  ,  This scenario is somewhat more troublesome than low awareness because it might suggest  lack of acceptance for the product or service concept 


-  The firm may need to add more salespeople or trade demonstrations or change the communication campaign to better demonstrate the product benefits 


-  However ,  if consumers are reasonably informed and many are rejecting the product ,  the company may need to be content with  narrow segment ,  drawing customers from the 25 percent of the market with favorable attitudes 


-  Contact lenses ,  for example ,  tend to fit this profile; they have failed to convert  large profile of the population ,  despite product improvements such as soft and long-wearing lenses 


-  Alternatively ,  the product may need to be modified to reach  broader market 


-  ,  In this scenario ,  awareness and attitude have developed nicely ,  but the market is not converting to trial 


-  Common causes of this problem are  (  )  poor distribution the product is not readily available ,  (  )  pricing  the price is too high ,  and  (  )  communications  the advertising campaign is too focused on reach  ( exposure to many possible customers )  ,  when it should be focused on frequency  ( the number of ad exposures per potential customer )  


-  The new product is performing well on all stages except purchase or repeat purchase 


-  Either the product does not deliver on its promises or the products benefits have been oversold 


-  Sometimes ,  however ,   low repeat purchase rate is due to pricing or distribution; price reductions and expanded or better directed distribution may be helpful 


-  ,  In summary ,  achieving rapid sales acceleration means moving customers through the purchase decision process expeditiously 


-  This requires more than simply appropriating  certain level of marketing resources 


-  It requires  tracking system that decomposes awareness ,  attitude ,  trial ,  and purchase in order to develop informed diagnoses of what types and levels of marketing resources will be required at different points in time 


-  ,  Speed is  management imperative ,  especially in the domain of new products 


-  However ,  being quick to market is only half the battle 


-  An equally important challenge is to shorten the time to market penetration 


-   products chances of long-run sales success are enhanced if it can achieve rapid market access and penetration 


-  Successful new products are an invitation to market entry for other competitors 


-  As product life cycles become shorter and the speed of imitation increases ,  ongoing innovation is the only sustainable strategy for success 


-  ,  We are all familiar with the typical S-shaped product life cycle 


-  In general ,  firms want maximum sales acceleration; the objective is to penetrate the market and seize the competitive initiative 


-  ,   have made five recommendations for reducing market penetration time: ,  The era when firms had the luxury of slowly rolling out products may be gone 


-  Innovation advantage dissipates quickly ,  and imitation is rampant 


-   firm must design global penetration strategies before market launch 


-  If it does not achieve simultaneous market access ,  the opportunity is soon lost 


-  If it does not blanket the market ,  competitors will find entry gaps 


-  Characterized by the media mostly in terms of political turmoil ,  malnutrition ,  and AIDS ,  Africa seems inconsequential as  potential market or as  low-cost manufacturing source 


-  Yet several MNCs enjoy good ,  sustained profitability from their African operations 


-  In addition ,  substantial political and economic changes now underway in many African countries prompt  closer look at the business opportunities in this emerging continent of forty-nine very diverse nations 


-  ,  Our purpose here is to highlight these changes and to provide practical advice on business strategy ,  marketing ,  and organization to companies doing or considering doing business in Africa 


-  We focus on sub-Saharan Africa and therefore exclude the Arab countries of North Africa that are more often identified with the Middle East 


-  We studied  variety of firms ,  representing leading consumer ,  industrial ,  and service companies that are marketing and ,  in some cases ,  manufacturing in Africa 


-  ,  The commercial importance of Africa to multinationals is limited but increasing: ,  Despite these positive aspects ,  Africas poverty continues to constrain its economic attractiveness 


-  The rate of population growth continues to outpace gross domestic product  ( GDP )  


-  Kenyas population will double in the next eighteen years ,  but Kenyan food production in 1991 was 38 percent less per capita than it was forty years earlier 


-  In 1965 ,  when Ghana became independent ,  its GDP per capita was similar to South Koreas; today ,  it is less than 15 percent of South Koreas 


-  They need about one-fifth of their export earnings to service this debt; this is  significant drain ,  but less than the 25 percent that Latin America ,  South Asia ,  and the Middle East need to service their debts 


-  Sub-Saharan Africa is heavily dependent on foreign aid ,  which accounts for 10 percent of its GNP and absorbs 35 percent of all the aid to developing countries 


-  The regions share of world trade is less than half what it was  decade ago ,  partly due to declining world prices of commodities ,  which constitute 91 percent of their exports 


-  ,  The African countries that have achieved sustained economic growth are largely those blessed with commodities whose world market prices have remained strong 


-  Oil-rich Gabon ,  for example ,  has  higher per capita income than South Africa 


-  Few African countries have significantly developed their manufacturing sectors; for example ,  in the ten member states of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference  ( SADCC )  ,  only 12 percent of GDP is in manufacturing 


-  The food processing and textile industries dominate the manufacturing sector throughout sub-Saharan Africa 


-   vigorous informal economy of microenterprises generally exists as these populations struggle for their economic survival 


-  Half the FDI in African countries  compared to only 20 percent in non-African developing countries  continues to focus on mining and agriculture ,  reinforcing the commodity base of African economies 


-  Only  quarter of the FDI targets the manufacturing sector ,  with more emphasis until recently on inefficient import substitution than on production for export 


-  This pattern of FDI has limited the ability of African countries to capitalize on the generalized system of preferences  ( GSP )  that reduces tariffs mainly on industrial rather than commodity exports from developing to developed countries 


-  The developed world seems determined to retain protectionist tariffs and subsidies that limit imports of agricultural commodities and low-cost textiles ,  although the European Common Market does give preferential access to exports from its former colonies 


-  While some countries serve as important entrepts  ( such as Botswana between South Africa and the rest of black Africa )  ,  they are exceptions 


-  ,  Yet ,  as indicated by the statistics presented in Tables  and  comparing ten of the principal countries in sub-Saharan Africa ,  there are substantial differences in their economic profiles and their potential for growth and industrial development 


-  For example ,  in Zambias first open election in seventeen years ,  Frederick Chilubas movement for multiparty democracy defeated the incumbent ,  Kenneth Kaunda ,  who had been the nations leader since independence 


-  ,  Of course ,  this move to democracy does not necessarily guarantee greater stability ,  especially since political parties tend to represent particular ethnic groups ,  thereby fueling long-standing social animosities 


-  The turbulence and often violent clashes occurring during the political campaigns in Kenya ,  Togo ,  Cte dIvoire ,  and Angola reveal this instability 


-  Increasingly ,  donor nations and agencies are linking foreign aid to sustained economic reform and movement toward democratization 


-  This does not necessarily mean an immediate switch to  multiparty system but it has reduced corruption ,  improved human rights ,  encouraged more financial accountability ,  and fostered freer judiciaries and media 


-  All of these factors will create  healthier environment for foreign investment 


-  Governments are privatizing many of the government-owned enterprises ,  thereby creating interesting acquisition opportunities for foreign investors 


-  The governments are liberalizing their economies and these freer markets remove many of the costly and constraining regulations that restricted business development and fostered corruption 


-  As  result ,  Western governments and agencies are imposing tighter conditions on their economic aid and are significantly decreasing the military component of the aid they give 


-  In  time of economic recession in the industrialized nations ,  there is little political sympathy for foreign aid ,  particularly to Africa ,  which many see as  bottomless pit 


-  As an example ,  the  


-  House of Representatives recently rejected  $25 billion foreign aid authorization bill 


-  African governments are competing against each other and against the former communist countries of the East bloc for  limited supply of aid and will have to show sustained commitment to reforms if they want their aid to continue 


-  Recent indications of cooperation between South Africa and its neighbors include the establishment of South African trade missions in six of ten SADCC countries; South African officials visits to Nigeria and other African countries; coventures involving Eksom ,  South Africas electric utility ,  and the governments of Zambia and Zimbabwe in developing  regional power grid for southern Africa; and the South African Development Banks involvement in rebuilding the port of Maputo in Mozambique 


- 12 The lifting of trade sanctions on South Africa in July 1991 and the renewed availability of  


-  Eximbank credits in February 1992 should help to stimulate economic development throughout southern Africa 


- 13 ,  As part of the drive toward economic reform in many African countries ,  governments are relaxing majority local ownership and permit requirements for foreign investment ,  differential treatment of foreign and local companies ,  and restrictions on both the currency in which company capital can be held and on the repatriation of earnings 


-  For example ,  Morocco has recently enjoyed strong growth in foreign investment following passage of  law permitting majority foreign ownership 


-  ,  Many of the MNCs that have shown sustained interest in doing business in Africa have been mining and agricultural companies attracted by the continents rich natural resources 


-  Chevron and other petroleum MNCs have also had long-standing interests in oil exploration and production in Angola and West Africa 


-  Historically ,  these companies have focused on extracting the raw commodity and exporting it ,  but recently ,  some are investing in downstream processing to add value at the production site 


-  ,  Most MNCs do business in Africa simply by exporting goods made elsewhere and selling through local agents or distributors 


-  Demand is particularly strong for equipment in the mining ,  construction ,  food processing ,  textile ,  medical ,  materials handling ,  telecommunications ,  and computer industries 


-  Governments or third-party agencies sponsoring development projects ,  such as the African Development Bank ,  European Investment Bank ,  and the World Bank ,  typically request tenders 


-  The larger countries with higher per capita incomes represent the best targets for consumer product marketers 


-  ,  Larger MNCs with  long-standing record of doing business in Africa and making relatively simple products are more likely to set up subsidiaries with manufacturing plants in the larger country markets and may also license production to third parties in some smaller countries 


-  Johnson  Johnson ,  for example ,  makes consumer products in eight plants in Africa and has manufacturing licensees in two others 


-  Many European multinationals have operated in Africa since colonial times 


-  For example ,  since 1953 ,  Unilever has produced basic consumer goods in Kenya 


-  Some MNCs ship obsolete ,  lower-speed production lines from their Western plants to Africa when they set up local manufacturing 


-  The British company Booker McConnell has expanded its sugar and poultry output in Kenya through local subcontractors without taking ownership of additional land 


-  Beyond the obvious issues of market size ,  economic regulations ,  political stability ,  and sustained commitment to reforms ,  other criteria include: ,  By choice or in response to government regulation ,  many MNCs are involved in joint ventures with local businesses or governments ,  especially in the larger markets where they have manufacturing operations 


-  AIG insurance ,  for example ,  has three quite different arrangements in its principal African markets: ,   government parastatal owned 45 percent of Unilevers Kenyan subsidiary ,  East African Industries 


-  ,  The availability of private ,  nongovernment ,  joint venture partners or licensees is improving 


-  Typical is the Fakhry Group in Cte dIvoire ,   private family-owned holding company that now owns  construction firm ,   freight-forwarding business ,   supermarket chain ,  and factories making T-shirts and blue jeans 


- 15 The jeans company ,  Challenger ,  was launched when Fakhry licensed the Wrangler name in 14 West African countries and acquired Wranglers plant with its well-trained labor after the  


-  owner decided to shift from direct production to licensing 


-  Challenger manufacturing capability allows it to change its product line quickly ,  responding to the latest European fashions 


-  This has earned it  niche as  quick-delivery ,  low-cost supplier to European distributors 


-  Additionally ,  it has positioned itself in the West African market as  supplier of high-status jeans priced below the market leader ,  Levi Strauss 


-  Partly as  result ,  for example ,  the Nigerian government is investing in demonstration manufacturing projects using local raw materials; once viable ,  local investors will buy the plants as sole owners or majority partners in joint ventures 


-  ,   minority of MNCs have  long-standing tradition of marketing in Africa 


-  ,  for example ,  has had  presence since 1929 


-  In 1992 ,  it employed some  , 000 people ,  had its own operations in twenty-two African countries including plants in ten ,  sold its products in  further twenty countries ,  and generated $300 million in annual sales 


-  As  result of experience ,   persistent presence through good times and bad ,  strong financial controls ,  and good government relations ,  Colgates African operations are consistently profitable 


-  ,  How do companies like Colgate that are successfully marketing in Africa respond to the challenges and opportunities of the region? The following sections attempt to answer that question 


-  ,  Since the African continent in total represents  small market opportunity ,  most MNCs offer  selection of basic ,  versatile products ,  without local adaptation ,  from among the product lines they sell in the developed world 


-  Johnson  Johnson ,  for example ,  has found that its multipurpose petroleum jelly for moisturizing dry skin is an especially strong seller 


-  Half of AIGs business in the developed world comes from personal insurance sales ,  but in Africa ,  only 15 percent of its sales are from this source 


-  Personal life insurance policies tend to be short-term endowment policies used as savings vehicles and are marketable only in countries with moderate inflation 


-  Readers Digest adapts 20 percent of its editorial material for its African regional edition published in South Africa and substitutes African photography ,  where appropriate ,  to accompany the other 80 percent 


-  Other companies manufacture in African plants products that are especially designed to meet African consumer preferences 


-  Colgate-Palmolive ,  for example ,  makes and markets Protex antibacterial soap  in the shape of  ball rather than  bar  and Axion detergent paste only in Africa 


-  ,  Industrial marketers that do little or no manufacturing in Africa do not usually adapt their products 


-  User skill levels are such ,  however ,  that the best equipment to sell is that which is highly durable and reliable in harsh environments and ,  at the same time ,  easy to operate and easy to repair if necessary 


-  Selling equipment with bells and whistles of marginal importance to the basic functionality of the product may do more harm than good 


-  One Kenyan printing company chose to buy mechanical rather than electronic printing equipment because there was no local repair capability for the more sophisticated electronic equipment 


-  IBM ,  which sells its products in twenty-nine African countries ,  does not adapt its hardware ,  but does adapt its software 


-  IBM also operates Data Service Centers where African small businesspeople can run their own software on IBM hardware at relatively low cost 


-  ,  Because buyers are concerned about breakdowns and after-sales service ,  there is  widespread inclination to pay price premiums for well-known brands of industrial goods sold with value-added technical service and support in preference to low-price generic knock-offs from China or Hungary ,  for example 


-  This is especially so in the case of industrial equipment purchased for projects financed by international aid and development organizations 


-  Consumers in African countries ,  especially younger ,  urban residents ,  also tend to be aware of and loyal to well-known Western brands ,  even in the case of packaged goods that would be regarded as low involvement and subject to high private-label penetration in the developed world 


-  Some brand names have become so well-known that they are used as generic terms for the category; Colgate ,  for example ,  is the generic term for toothpaste for many African consumers 


-  As  result of long-standing selling efforts ,  brands from companies based in each countrys former colonial power retain dominance; for example ,  French brands of cigarettes are dominant in West Africa while British brands are strongest in East and South Africa 


-  Branded products will not automatically succeed when transferred from one African country to another due to important differences in consumer preferences 


-  ,  Some consumer goods companies offer similar pack sizes to those used in the West 


-  In the case of packaged goods companies offering multiple pack sizes ,  relative demand for each is driven by disposable income rather than household size 


-  Only the well-off minority enjoys the convenience of larger sizes; they are typically available only through urban supermarkets 


-  The smallest pack sizes are usually the best sellers ,  and in many countries ,  street hawkers break bulk further by selling ,  for example ,  individual tablets of medications or single cigarettes on street corners or through roadside stands 


-  ,  Marketers must remember that the product turnover rate ,  especially in rural outlets ,  is slow 


-  Without adding cost ,  packaging must be robust enough to protect products from heat and other poor storage conditions for long periods before they are sold to consumers 


-  There have been packaging shifts ,  particularly from tin to plastic ,  in response to cost differentials and consumer preferences 


-  ,  Storage conditions also influence the mix of products that companies can sell successfully 


-  Diet Coke is not marketed outside the tourist areas ,  not only because calorie consciousness is irrelevant to African consumers but also because the aspartame in the drink breaks down in sustained heat 


-  Margarine has  longer shelf life than butter ,  and sterilized milk packaged in Tetra-Pak containers has  multimonth shelf life 


-  ,  Most western goods are not manufactured in the African country in which they are sold but are imported from European plants or ,  in the case of some simple consumer goods and textile products ,  from other African countries 


-  Typically ,  an MNC will appoint an exclusive distributor in each market or enter into one or more distribution agreements ,  covering  subregion of several small country markets 


-  Any agreement must include  clearcut performance-based exit clause ,  along with the requirement that all shipments be paid for on an irrevocable letter-of-credit basis 


-  Hence ,  several MNCs ,  such as IBM and Nalco ,  have their own missionary salespeople and service technicians working in association with local distributors whose functions are often confined to the distribution of products 


-  The unpredictability of obtaining import licenses and delays in shipments reaching their final destinations from ports of entry often impair the delivery of customer orders 


-  However ,  better road and rail links offering more choice and ,  hence ,  lower costs are promised in southern Africa now that peace is returning to Mozambique and Angola 


-  Several Japanese auto companies maintain container ships full of cars and light trucks year-round in international waters off the East African coast; this permits  dealers order in any one country to be filled quickly and reduces the manufacturers financial risk of having valuable inventory in countries of uncertain stability 


-  ,  The main distribution challenge for consumer goods marketers is to ensure product availability in the fragmented and undercapitalized distribution systems that characterize African countries 


-  Among the objectives in Coca-Cola Companys Three  African strategy of availability ,  affordability ,  and acceptability ,  the principal challenge is the first 


-  Coca-Cola also finds expanded availability impeded by  periodic lack of capital that can prevent new bottling plants from being built 


-  Colgate-Palmolive and Johnson  Johnson both use van rancheros to carry their products to rural areas;  loudspeaker on the van announces its arrival to the locals 


-  For example ,  in West Africa ,  immigrant Lebanese and Greek traders have become increasingly important ,  and in East Africa ,  distributors of Asian descent often dominate 


-  One tobacco company achieved good distribution in Senegal by working through  team of Mauritanian distributors on sixty-day cash terms 


-  When  border dispute forced all the Mauritanians living in Senegal to flee ,  the company was able to reestablish its distribution through daily cash sales at the factory gate to Senegalese small businesses 


-  First ,  MNCs marketing locally manufactured goods may find that the benefit of lower labor costs is offset by higher costs for other raw material inputs ,  especially if they have to secure them from  government-controlled monopoly or ,  alternatively ,  import them 


-  This often means that extra inventories are needed in case they cannot obtain import licenses 


-  Second ,  distributors and business customers purchase in smaller volumes than in the West ,  so  quantity discount structure offering price breaks at lower volume levels must be developed 


-  Cargill and other multinational agricultural companies provide farmers with financing but require them to have  bank account through which monthly loan payments are remitted automatically to the lender 


-  Fourth ,  MNCs marketing less sophisticated products are likely to encounter an unexpected mix of competitors that often includes third-world multinationals for whom Africa represents  more important export market than for developed country MNCs17 ,  foreign government agencies seeking to dump excess capacity at rock-bottom prices ,  plus local entrepreneurs with low overheads as well as counterfeiters of branded products operating in the informal barter economy 


-  On the other hand ,  in many African countries ,  Citibank faces little competition even on the basic loans and letters of credit and ,  based on years of experience in selecting which risks to accept ,  makes good profits on six percent spreads between average loan and deposit rates 


-  ,  Despite  deteriorating transportation infrastructure in Africa ,  gray marketing  ( transshipment of goods purchased in  low-priced market to  high-priced one )  and smuggling are prevalent ,  particularly in the case of low bulk-to-value products such as cigarettes ,  pharmaceuticals ,  and cosmetics 


-  Economic volatility ,  high tariff barriers ,  and rapid currency swings make gray marketing both feasible and attractive to Lebanese and Asian expatriate traders 


-  The small West African country of Togo ,  for example ,  has long been  point from which distributors smuggle goods into Nigeria 


-  ,  Government price controls are less common and less broadly applied today than  decade ago; they are more likely to appear in French- than in English-speaking African countries 


-  There are fewer controls on consumer goods  ( except on the best-known ,  highly visible brands )  than on strategically important industrial goods and services such as computers ,  bank lending ,  and insurance rates 


-  Where price controls are present ,  most MNCs try to negotiate price increases to ensure that they can maintain contribution margins in case price controls are imposed or inflation grows more rapidly than expected 


-  If the company is marketing basic goods ,  the government resists authorizing price increases due to their political sensitivity 


-  Fixed prices in the face of rising production costs often puts an MNC in  negative margin situation ,  which is what Unilevers East African Industries encountered in 1992 in Kenya 


-  ,  Government regulations sometimes require artificial inflation rather than deflation of MNC prices 


-  ,  The communications mix that MNCs use in African countries is  function of three principal factors: the household penetration of various advertising media; the relative importance of trial versus repeat purchases; and the availability of and ability to execute different sales promotion techniques 


-  ,  Media penetration varies widely from country to country ,  as  function of the stage of economic development ,  literacy rates ,  urbanization ,  and level of government control 


- 18 These are the household penetration levels for three media in the adjacent countries of Uganda and Kenya: ,  ,  Some MNCs such as Coca-Cola use television advertising on  limited basis not only because of the modest household penetration but also because  high percentage of sets are black and white and ,  therefore ,  not very powerful in conveying image-building advertising 


-  Consumer goods MNCs find that radio is the most popular medium 


-  Even though they may have to produce commercials in multiple languages ,  they can develop locally tailored ads cheaply to incorporate the basic brand benefit message that most marketers need to communicate ,  thus achieving the highest household reach of any medium 


-  Another important advertising medium is the loudspeakers on the van rancheros that distribute products to rural areas and small towns 


-  Coca-Cola advertising ,  for example ,  often shows the beverage being consumed not on  free-standing basis but rather in conjunction with meals shared by large groups of family members 


-  Another campaign ,  this time by  bank in Cte dIvoire ,  claimed effectively: We offer customers the wisdom of the old world combined with the technology of the new 


-  Colgate also organizes movie trucks that visit rural towns and show open-air movies in exchange for  toothpaste carton or  soap bar wrapper 


-  ,  Business-to-business marketers use little advertising ,  even less in French- than English-speaking Africa 


-  However ,  merchandising brochures are important and should be of high quality ,  especially in the more developed African countries 


-  Business marketers typically find that personal selling coupled with demonstrations and/or trials are especially effective 


-  The vice president is usually not located in the region but rather at the MNCs European headquarters or in  European city such as Geneva or Rome with particularly good flight connections to the region and where the principal international aid organizations serving the region are also headquartered 


-  An exception is Johnson  Johnsons VP in charge of Africa and the Middle East 


-  From there ,  with the aid of fax communications ,  he can oversee twelve country managers in Africa ,  tap into the expertise of the world headquarters staff ,  and raise his regions visibility at corporate headquarters 


-  For example: ,  In Africa ,  most MNCs appoint young British ,  French ,  or American managers with an international perspective ,  an entrepreneurial spirit ,   strong finance background ,  and general management potential as country managers 


-  They usually compensate them on the basis of sales ,  profitability ,  and ,  unusually important ,  collection of receivables 


-  Except for the largest markets ,  MNC country managers in Africa are typically in their first general management positions and are responsible for  modest sales volume;  typical Colgate-Palmolive country manager in charge of Kenya ,  for example ,  would be responsible for  unit generating about $20 million in annual sales 


-  As  country manager ,  you have to instill in your customers that they owe you as an individual rather than the company 


-  The MNCs are able to attract high-quality locals because of the perceived prestige of working for such companies 


-  For example ,  African executives head East African Industries and Barclays Bank in Kenya 


-  Still others have entered government service in their home countries and become cabinet members or senior central bank officials ,  giving Citibank excellent access to top-level public policy-makers 


-  ,  Some MNCs ,  however ,  have cited difficulties in human resource development of blacks ,  particularly in South Africa 


-  ,  Whether and how to retain  marketing presence in South Africa are important dilemmas ,  but by no means the only ones confronting MNCs doing business in Africa 


-  MNCs divested their holdings in South Africa ,  but in such  way that they could still service existing customers and make new products available to the market 


-  AIG ,  for example ,  divested its South African company in 1987 but continues to provide reinsurance to the autonomous local company; AIG now acts ,  therefore ,  in the role of wholesaler rather than retailer 


-  ISM is the sole marketer of IBM products in South Africa 


- 20 ,  High-profile companies like IBM that sell  large percentage of their total volume to government agencies have to be especially sensitive to being seen as good corporate citizens 


-  IBM therefore supports many government- and development agency-sponsored projects throughout Africa ,  particularly those that help to develop small businesses and local entrepreneurship 


-  Between 1985 and 1992 ,  for example ,  IBM contributed $21 million to its South African Projects Fund ,  which supports economic development ,  legal reform ,  and education programs to benefit black South Africans 


-  Coca-Cola Company provides similar support; good government and community relations are essential to secure import licenses for concentrate and to reduce the likelihood of price controls 


-  Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive ,  meanwhile ,  work hard to develop local sources of chemicals and packaging materials of consistent quality 


-  And the MNCs play an important role in developing human resources through their company training programs 


-  For example: ,  The size of Africas economic pie is relatively small 


-  The opportunities for MNCs to increase trade with Africa and to exploit low-cost manufacturing as well as marketing opportunities are improving 


-  There are proven first-mover advantages 


-  Export ,  licensing ,  and even production opportunities exist for medium-size firms too 


-  Firms must recognize that Africas lower level of economic development creates not only  series of distinctive operating problems and challenges ,  but also significant needs and opportunities 


-  Products ,  services ,  and management techniques that have matured elsewhere can find new life in these young and untapped markets 


- Organizations increasingly rely on information technology  ( IT )  both to perform their day-today operations and as  source of new products and services 


-  The popular focus has been on hardware components ,  and that story has been overwhelmingly positive: the new technologies that come to market are cheaper ,  more reliable ,  and more portable than previous ones 


-  We commonly read that software is late ,  over budget ,  and of poor quality 


-  Specific examples of software in the news are almost always negative  microcomputer software vendors that deliver releases late ,  federal government systems projects that never reach the implementation stage ,  and the recent telephone system outage that was blamed on  Texas supplier who changed only three or four lines of the program 


-  Software production represents the single biggest obstacle to the successful use of IT in organizations; all precepts such as using IT for strategic advantage ,  reengineering the business ,  and informating the workplace become mere slogans if the necessary software is not properly delivered on time 


-   quick review of trade press magazines will reveal articles on such topics as computer-aided software engineering  ( CASE )  ,  rapid applications development ,  cleanroom software engineering ,  software factories ,  and object-oriented  ( OO )  approaches 


-  All of these represent software engineering process technologies ,  that is ,  means by which an application software product is created  ( hereafter software process technologies )  


-  The idea that process technologies in general are critical sources of economic success is gaining acceptance 


-  However ,  the problem with this rich set of software process technologies is that they may be technically incompatible ,  or ,  if not ,  then at least sufficiently expensive and requiring significantly large changes in an organizations operation that they are unlikely to be successfully adopted at the same time 


-  ,  How ,  then ,  can the chief information officer  ( CIO )  of  large business application development organization choose which ,  if any ,  of these new software process technologies to adopt? Unfortunately ,  the choice of  new approach is rendered very difficult by the lack of unbiased information sources 


-  ,  Moreover ,  many previous technologies have been so oversold that it is now sometimes difficult to tell legitimate enthusiasm from marketing hype 


-  These were supposed to solve many problems ,  not just software development ,  and they merited at least two cover stories in Business week over the past decade ,  perhaps the only software process technology to merit such general press attention 


-  However ,  according to Brooks and others ,  the gains delivered by this technology have been much less than promised 


-  For example ,  third-generation software languages such as COBOL ,  FORTRAN ,  and  are dominant over their predecessor second-generation assembly languages in that second-generation languages are now relegated to highly specialized portions of applications and are not chosen as the primary software process technology for programming if any other alternative is available 


-  ,  The reason that  CIO should care about sorting out which new software process technologies are likely to be dominant is that the costs of choosing  nondominant technology can be substantial 


-  In particular ,  even technologies that offer some technical advantages over their predecessors may not end up dominating because they fail to achieve  critical mass 


-  And once an organization commits to  technology that then fails to become dominant ,  it faces  number of additional problems ,  such as: ,  Given the significant learning and adoption startup costs ,  and the increased risk of failure ,  these additional burdens may make the adoption of  nondominant technology extremely expensive in the long run 


-  ,  The question remains: How can you choose tomorrows dominant software process technology from todays list of candidates? Arguably ,  the leading candidate at the moment is the object-oriented approach 


-  Although some of the key ideas of OO date back to late 1960s computer science research ,  it is in the past six years that OO has become  popular research topic and that commercial products have become widely available for its use 


-  The central ideas of OO fit well with previous advances in software engineering ,  and proponents argue that the approach lends itself to the assembly of previously developed ,  well-tested components into software systems ,  thereby avoiding the labor-intensive and less reliable approach of building everything from scratch 


-  ,  Will OO become the dominant software process technology of the future for in-house business application development? Our thesis is that for any software process technology to become dominant ,  it must first overcome  series of obstacles to adoptability 


-  ,  In the sections that follow ,  we describe these two points of view and apply them to three past software process technologies  ( structured analysis and design methodologies ,  production fourth-generation languages ,  and relational database management systems )  


-  We construct  framework that evaluates the likelihood of dominance based on the technologys adoptability for both individual organizations and for whole communities or industries 


-  ,  Why are some innovations adopted more rapidly than others? This simple question has been the subject of intense study by innovation diffusion researchers 


-  DOI researchers have typically studied the technology adoption decisions of individuals or organizations without taking into account community issues that strongly affect the innovations inherent economic value 


-  ( For example ,  widespread adoption of  software engineering process innovation increases the likelihood of the availability of complementary software tools 


-  )  Fortunately ,   second line of research ,  in the area of the economics of technology standards ,  is focused on the role of community effects on technology adoption 


-  ,  DOI research has been broadly defined as the study of how innovations spread through  population of potential adopters over time 


-  Other factors include the characteristics of the adopters and the means employed by vendors and change agents to persuade them to adopt 


-  ,  To address the broader question of the likely rate of adoption of  specific innovation across an entire population ,  one must look to attributes of the innovation itself Everett Rogers reviewed hundreds of diffusion studies and identified five generic innovation attributes that influence rates of adoption:  (  )  relative advantage ,  (  )  compatibility ,  (  )  complexity ,  (  )  trialability ,  and  (  )  observability 


-  ,  of consumer goods )  ,  Van de Ven and others have argued that innovation attributes also play an important role in adoptions by organizations 


-  In fact ,  these researchers maintain that innovation attributes take on  broader role in the context of organizational adoption of complex technologies ,  affecting not only the initial decision to adopt ,  but also the ease of traversing later stages of adoption such as implementation ,  adaptation ,  and routinization 


-  Hence ,  the analysis of innovation attributes provides  basis for assessing not only the likely rate of adoption across  population ,  but also the technologys comparative adoptability within individual firms  (  


-  ,  Table  briefly defines Rogerss five innovation attributes ,  tailored somewhat to better fit the context of organizational adoption of complex technologies 


-  10 With the exception of complexity ,  high values of the attribute are favorable to easier implementation within  given organization 


-  ,  The explanations for the relative advantage ,  compatibility ,  and complexity attributes are straightforward enough: organizations are more likely to be willing and able to adopt innovations that offer clear advantages ,  that do not drastically interfere with existing practices ,  and that are easier to understand 


-  Trialability and observability are both related to risk 


-  ,  Economists have identified several sources of increasing returns to adoption ,  but the three most applicable to software process technologies are learning by using ,  positive network externalities ,  and technological interrelatedness 


-  Learning by using means that  technologys price-performance ratio improves rapidly as  community of adopters  ( vendors and users )  accumulates experience in developing and applying the technology 


-  Positive network externalities  ( sometimes called network benefits )  means that the immediate benefits of use are  direct function of the number of current adopters 


-  ( The classic example here is the telephone network ,  where the number of people available to call depends on the number of previous subscribers 


-  )  Technological interrelatedness means that  large base of compatible products  and hence  large base of likely adopters  is needed to make the technology worthwhile as  whole 


- 12 Among them ,  Farrell and Saloner have noted that  group of adopters ,  facing  decision to adopt  new and technically superior standard ,  may still fail to adopt in numbers necessary to achieve critical mass because of each adopters reluctance to be the first to pay either of two early adoption penalties: transient incompatibility costs  ( because of delays in achieving  satisfactory network for the new technology )  and risk of stranding  ( because of failure to ever achieve  critical mass of adoption )  


- 14  well-known example of this situation is the persistence of the inefficient QWERTY layout for typewriter keyboards  ( designed in the late 1800s to slow typists down sufficiently to avoid key jamming )  despite the later invention of many superior keyboard layouts 


-  Hence the mere existence of  prior technologys installed base represents  drag on the communitys progress toward switching to the new technology because few adopters are willing to absorb the transition costs associated with joining  small ,  immature network 


-  When adoption requires large ,  irreversible investments ,  this reluctance grows even stronger because  substantial risk premium must be added to adoption costs to take into account the chance of being stranded should  satisfactory network never develop for the new technology 


-  Sponsors can tip the cost-benefit equation in favor of the new technology by actively subsidizing early adopters ,  by making credible commitments to develop the technology regardless of the initial adoption rate ,  and by setting standards that ensure that  single network will emerge around the new technology instead of  pastiche of smaller ,  potentially incompatible networks  ( with correspondingly diffused network benefits )  


-  Early in the development cycle ,  promising new technologies typically enjoy  kind of honeymoon period during which some firms join an immature network assuming that widespread adoption will occur later 


-  For example ,  in the software industry ,  data-oriented design methodologies emerged at the same time many organizations were beginning to view data as  shared corporation resource 


-  Such characteristics can lend an air of inevitability to  technology 


-  On the negative side ,  widely publicized adoption horror stories ,  substantial improvements to the existing dominant technology ,  or the rise of  new ,  even more promising substitute technology can cut the honeymoon period short 


-  The technology standards perspective ,  by contrast ,  sees adoption much more dichotomously: if  technology achieves critical mass within some reasonable period of time  ( during its honeymoon period )  ,  it will become dominant 


-  ,  The two perspectives described above have been useful in explaining adoption in many industries ,  but how accurately do they describe the speed and pattern of adoption for historical innovations in software engineering? ,  To answer this question ,  we examined three recent candidates for dominance in the realm of software engineering:  (  )  structured analysis and design methodologies  ( hereafter structured methodologies )  ,  (  )  production fourth-generation languages  ( 4GLs )  ,  and  (  )  relational database management systems  ( RDBs )  


-  Each of these innovations was intended to revolutionize  different segment of the software engineering discipline  analysis and design ,  coding and testing ,  and data management ,  respectively 


-  ,  In the mid-1970s ,  structured methodologies  ( such as DeMarco structured analysis and Yourdon/Constantine structure design )  emerged to replace the informal analysis and design practices of the day with an engineering style dedicated to rigorous procedures ,  formal diagrams ,  and measures of design quality 


-  These methodologies went beyond the mere adoption of  systems development life cycle and prescribed very specific schedules of tasks and activities 


-  ,  Although  wide variety of special- purpose 4GLs had previously existed ,  it was not until the early 1980s that  new breed of production 4GLs became commercially available 


-  Production 4GLs ,  unlike end-user query-oriented 4GLs like FOCUS and RAMIS II ,  are those languages such as Natural ,  ADS/Online ,  and IDEAL that were designed to support development of large-scale business systems ,   domain that was then dominated by COBOL 


-  ,  Commercial RDBs emerged in the early 1980s as an alternative to the hierarchical and network model databases such as IMS and IDMS 


-  Although RDBs and production 4GLs emerged concurrently ,  and some vendors bundled the two technologies together ,  most vendors took  mix-and-match approach wherein  production 4GL could be used with nonrelational databases ,  and  relational database could be accessed via 3GLs ,  especially COBOL 


-  For production 4GLs and RDBs ,  this window was the early 1980s ,  when they were slated to replace 3GLs and earlier database models ,  respectively 


-  Of the three technologies ,  only RDBs have proven to be dominant in the sense that they replaced the prior technology for new development activities 


-  It is unlikely that an organization would routinely proceed with developing  new application using an older generation  ( nonrelational )  database model ,  whereas organizations continually choose the older ,  third-generation languages for new development 


-  Many organizations still cling to ad hoc methods within the life cycle approach or have abandoned the life cycle altogether for prototyping approaches that make no use of structured methods 


-  ,  According to the DOI view ,  an innovations adoption rate and ease of implementation are largely determined by its degree of relative advantage ,  compatibility ,  complexity ,  trialability ,  and observability 


-  Although structured methodologies  ( like any legitimate candidate to dominance )  offered relative advantages over informal methodologies ,  relatively high complexity and relatively low compatibility ,  trialability ,  and observability raised substantial barriers to rapid widespread adoption 


-  ,  Structured methodologies were largely incompatible with the practices of most development groups because they overturned the craft-oriented values of experienced project managers of the 1970s ,  who had individually acquired an idiosyncratic array of guidelines during their apprenticeships 


-  They required adopters to learn an extensive new skill set ,  and they changed many standard work practices associated with project organization and developer-client interactions  ( such as requiring that greater resources be devoted to  projects analysis and design phases )  


-  ,  Structured methodologies were also difficult to put through  trial period because of significant upfront training costs 


-  But as the benefits of structured methodologies were mainly improved system maintainability and avoidance of development fiascoes ,  an extended trial period was needed to allow time for these benefits to unfold 


-  Finally ,  structured methodologies suffered from low observability because it was difficult to describe concretely how benefits such as higher maintainability were to be achieved 


-  ,  In summary ,  the DOI view would have suggested  slow and problematic adoption of structured methodologies ,  owing to relatively low compatibility ,  high complexity ,  low trialability ,  and low observability 


-  Vendors and the business press were reporting productivity gains of ten-to-one; indeed ,  one industry guru defined 4GLs in this way 


-  RDBs enjoyed the advantage of  respected theoretical foundation and near universal acclaim in the academic community as  simpler ,  more elegant data model that was also more robust to change 


-  Therefore ,  the relative advantages of production 4GLs and RDBs were perceived as being particularly high 


-  Adoption of production 4GLs and RDBs required  more straightforward substitution of new skills for old ,  with no major changes in work organization or reductions in autonomy for system developers 


-  Although some idiosyncratic 3GL skills were lost with production 4GLs ,  the effect was less severe than with structured methodologies 


-  Production 4GLs were intended to simplify programming by letting the machine do more of the work ,  which is not to say that production 4GLs were simple to use in some absolute sense ,  but rather that they were simpler to use than alternative languages like COBOL 


-  Likewise ,  RDBs were much simpler to use than first-generation database systems ,  with relatively intuitive select and join commands replacing arcane pointer references 


-  ,  Although production 4GLs and RDBs required upfront investments in software and training comparable to structured methodologies ,  it was possible to demonstrate value on  single pilot project 


-  As  result ,  the costs of experimenting with either technology could be kept at reasonable levels 


-  Finally ,  production 4GLs were highly observable because adopters could draw concrete comparisons between applications written in  production 4GL and  third-generation language  (  


-  RDBs ,  by contrast ,  suffered from lower observability because it was difficult to describe in concrete terms how they would achieve greater flexibility and data independence 


-  ,  The three technologies under discussion are all subject to increasing returns to adoption; they become much more valuable to individual adopters to the extent that others adopt 


-  Widespread adoption leads to faster maturation  ( learning by using )  ,  wider availability of qualified personnel  ( positive network externalities )  ,  and  larger array of complementary products and services  ( technological interrelatedness )  


-  Hence ,  the technology standards view is appropriate for analyzing the communitywide adoptability of these three technologies 


-  ,  When introduced in the early 1980s ,  production 4GLs were  textbook case of an innovation facing  monolithic installed base ,  namely ,  the COBOL programming language 


-  Forgoing the COBOL standard meant missing out on  large network of experienced personnel and compatible tools  (  


-  ,  database systems )  


-  ,  Adoption of production 4GLs required largely irreversible investments in staff training and software  specialized assets that lose most or all of their value should the investment project be abandoned later 


-  In the case of production 4GLs ,  many languages emerged  none supported by  dominant sponsor 


-  Production 4GLs even lacked  single authority figure to define exactly what capabilities  production 4GL should provide 


-  Production 4GLs were developed primarily by innovators in the commercial sector and suffered from  lack of scientific support or more objective boosterism from the academic community 


-  Perhaps more damaging ,  4GLs experienced some widely publicized adoption fiascoes ,  such as the infamous New Jersey Department of Motor Vehicles case 


-  RDBs faced an installed base of first-generation database systems ,  although not one so mature and ubiquitous as COBOL 


-  In addition ,  the first-generation database market was fragmented ,  meaning that the benefits associated with joining the network of any given database product  (  


-  ,  As with production 4GLs ,  RDBs and structured methodologies required largely irreversible investments in staff training 


-  Codd who clearly established the criteria for database management systems  ( DBMS )  to qualify as fully relational 


-  ,  Ed Yourdon and Tom DeMarco ,  among others )  


-  Although none of the three technologies was strongly sponsored in the traditional sense of  single organization encouraging adoption ,  RDBs and structured methodologies had widely recognized leaders defining the technology and proselytizing for widespread adoption ,  and they therefore rank relatively higher than production 4GLs on this dimension 


-  In addition ,  the strengths of RDBs  data independence and greatly simplified information retrieval  complemented industry trends toward more data-intensive applications 


-  Structured methodologies were certainly in line with the trend in the 1970s toward large-scale development projects ,  and they also escaped widely publicized disasters 


-  Therefore ,  production 4GLs rated the poorest on this dimension 


-  ,  To summarize ,  compared with production 4GLs ,  RDBs faced  much less well-established installed base and had the advantage of positive expectations and  strong sponsor to push forward  cohesive definition of the technology 


-  Therefore ,  the economics of technology standards view ,  although accurately reflecting the fate of production 4GLs ,  does not effectively discriminate between structured methodologies and RDBs and therefore would have been an inadequate single explanation of the ultimate dispositions of these technologies 


-  ,  To summarize ,  the DOI perspective rates production 4GLs highly but fails to take into account the effects of increasing returns to adoption present in software process technologies 


-  The economics of technology standards perspective rates structured methodologies highly but fails to consider the delays caused by low organizational adoptability 


-  The vertical axis reflects the DOI view of organizational adoptability 


-  The horizontal axis reflects the economics of technology standards perspective of community adoptability 


-  Production 4GLs diffused rapidly to  number of organizations but never displaced 3GLs as the dominant choice for new development ,  except possibly in some niche applications 


-  3GLs are still the language of choice for code generators ,  which may imply that  plateau has been reached for production 4GL adoption 


-  Structured methodologies ,  almost twenty years after their introduction ,  are still being adopted very slowly ,  as evidenced by the difficulty in introducing CASE tools that are tied to these methodologies 


-  ,   daunting lexicon has developed around object-oriented technology ,  partly because the object-oriented approach touches all aspects of software engineering and partly because many of the concepts associated with OO have no direct analogs in the world of conventional systems development  ( see Table  for  list of key terms )  


-  Yet the essence of the object-oriented approach can be captured by two principles for structuring systems: storing data and related operations together within objects  ( encapsulation )  and sharing commonalities between classes of objects  ( inheritance )  


-  ,  Designers achieve encapsulation by placing  set of data and all the valid operations on that data together inside  metaphorical capsule called an object 


-  The logic behind encapsulation is simple: as there is usually  limited number of sensible operations for any given data structure ,  why not restrict processing to only these operations and put them together with the data in one place? Although this seems reasonable ,  it is not how traditional systems are organized 


-  In  traditional system ,  the various operations associated with any given set of data  ( edits ,  calculations ,  transformations ,  update logic ,  and so forth )  are typically repeated ,  more or less consistently ,  in many otherwise independent application programs 


-  To take  simple example ,  variants on an update customer balance operation might appear in  billing program ,   cash processing program ,  and  credit processing program 


-  To take  particularly literal example ,   sporting dog inherits attributes  ( physical characteristics )  and behaviors  ( pointing and retrieving )  from its parents 


-  For example ,  suppose that employees are classified as hourly or salaried 


-  With inheritance ,   designer places common data and operations in  parent employee class and unique characteristics  (  


-  This avoids the need to either  (  )  create  single set of data and operations with extra logic to handle differences between kinds of employees or  (  )  create two separate and largely redundant sets of data and operations  ( one for each employee type )  


-  As with encapsulation ,  inheritance is rarely used in traditional systems development because conventional programming languages make it difficult to be implemented as  primary structuring principle 


-  These qualities in turn can drastically reduce system development and maintenance cost while improving system flexibility and quality 


-  For example ,  consider the different level of detail required to explain  combustion engine to  driver ,  mechanic ,  or physicist 


-  In fact ,  the structured programming movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s was largely an attempt to develop methods to improve the extent and quality of modularity in delivered systems 


-  The net result of high-quality modularity is to localize system functionality so that changes can be made to one part of  system without  cascade of related changes 


-  This cascade of changes  ( the so-called ripple effect )  can be devastating; in many systems ,  hundreds or thousands of programs may be interdependent because of program code redundancies or ,  more subtly ,  the sharing of common data 


-  (  seemingly minor change to the meaning or structure of data can ripple across all programs that share the data 


-  )  Encapsulation promotes  looser coupling of modules by disallowing sharing of data and limiting the range of module interdependencies to their external interfaces 


-  Although software reuse is perhaps the most persistently claimed advantage of object orientation ,  it has existed in one form or another since the early days of programming 


-  Encapsulation promotes information hiding ,  which reduces the burden of describing and finding reusable components   significant obstacle to reuse in  large-scale environment 


-  Each time  new class is defined in an inheritance structure ,  this implicitly enforces reuse of operations from the parents of the new class 


-  ,  Where does object orientation fit on the new framework? Is it more likely to become  dominant technology or to end up in the slow mover ,  niche ,  or experimental categories? To answer this question ,  we must analyze object orientation along the dimensions of organizational adoptability and community adoptability 


-  ,  Like production 4GLs and RDBs ,  object orientation rates highly on perceived relative advantage 


-  Proponents have argued that object orientation promotes abstraction ,  modularity ,  and reuse ,  all of which are long-standing objectives of the software engineering field 


-  It is fair to assume ,  then ,  that many potential adopters will develop favorable opinions of the advantages of object orientation based on positive reviews in the literature and their own assessments of the technologys potential merits 


-  Object orientation is  new development model and requires new skills in analysis ,  design ,  and programming that replace ,  rather than build on ,  those associated with conventional development 


- 17 In addition ,  several authors have noted that successful reuse requires marked changes in culture and values 


- 18 It has been observed that to maximize reuse ,  developers must learn to assemble applications using objects developed by others 


-  Furthermore ,  OO adoption as an organizations standard approach will likely require  restructuring of development teams 


-  Some proponents have suggested the need to institutionalize reuse through creation of  new function similar to data administration that administers and controls the common repository of reusable components 


-  To be successful with OO as  software engineering process technology ,  an adopter must absorb  new lexicon ,  new development methodologies ,  and new development tools 


-  The need to master such concepts as encapsulation ,  inheritance ,  information hiding ,  polymorphism ,  and many others beyond those presented in Table  represents  significant barrier to achieving an overall understanding of object orientation and its proper application 


-  As with the structured methodologies ,  production ROBs ,  and 4GLs ,  OO will require substantial upfront expenditures on software and training in order to conduct meaningful pilot projects 


- 21 In the meantime ,  adopters are likely to experience an initial productivity decline because of the extra initial effort to design modules for reuse 


-  The benefits of object orientation resist direct observation ,  and few organizations collect and track the software metrics required to demonstrate increased reuse ,  improved maintainability ,  or incremental improvements in productivity 


-  As  result ,  object orientation suffers from low observability 


-  ,  In summary ,  object orientation rates comparably with structured methodologies ,  the least favorable of the three previously reviewed technologies ,  on ease of adoption ,  with high relative advantage ,  but equal or lower ratings on compatibility ,  complexity ,  trialability ,  and observability 


-  ,  For object orientation ,  the rival entrenched technology is not just  language generation or  database model ,  but the entire procedural paradigm for software development 


-  New approaches have been proposed in every segment of software engineering: analysis  ( OOA )  ,  design  ( OOD )  ,  programming  ( OOP )  ,  and databases  ( OODBMS )  


-  Full object orientation also requires more extensive irreversible investments than production 4GLs or ROBs because of  substantially larger training burden and  wider array of potential software purchases  (  


-  For both these reasons ,   consortium can be  weaker sponsor than  single vendor or other source 


-  It appears well suited to event-driven graphical user interfaces ,  multimedia systems  ( voice ,  imaging ,  animation )  ,  and highly parallel processing  (  


-  These kinds of applications tend to require complex multilevel data structures and data encapsulation ,  both of which are difficult to implement within the procedural paradigm ,  but they play to the particular strengths of object orientation 


-  However ,  production 4GLs also had high positive expectations ,  reflected in their very name ,  which implied an inevitability to their replacing 3GLs 


-  ,  In summary ,  object orientation rates about the same as production 4GLs ,  the lowest of the previously reviewed software engineering innovations ,  from the economics of technology standards view 


-  Object orientation faces an even more thoroughly entrenched standard  ( the procedural paradigm )  and requires  more extensive investment in irreversible assets than production 4GLs 


-  While object orientation does appear to be better sponsored than production 4GLs ,  this sponsorship is in the form of  potentially fragile consortium 


-  This suggests that further development of the technology will be needed before widespread adoption will occur 


-  ,  The poor state of software development practice has engendered  large number of proposed process technology improvements 


-  Managers seeking advice on new software process technologies should learn from the lessons of technological change in other domains while recognizing the relatively unique features of software process technologies 


-  As we have shown ,  the framework offers an explanation for the adoption trajectory of previous technologies in analysis and design ,  coding and testing ,  and data management 


-  Object orientation ,  the latest widely touted software process technology ,  rates unfavorably on both scales relative to these prior technologies and thus is unlikely to become the dominant software process technology for large in-house business application developers without significant changes 


-  ,  What are the risks for the CIO of ignoring the framework when evaluating software process technologies? The primary risk associated with early adoption of niche technologies is being stranded on  technological spur away from the main track of technology development; the primary risk associated with early adoption of slow movers is implementation failure or the need to weather an extended period of transient incompatibility costs while waiting for  robust network to emerge 


-  Companies facing  wave of crucial new development projects that cannot feasibly be done with current technologies might consider  particularly well-suited niche technology  with the understanding that an expensive redevelopment or conversion may become necessary sooner  (  


-  Companies that are facing  major system replacement decision ,  that have  successful track record in adopting bleeding edge technologies ,  and that have the resources to support  robust internal training program might consider adopting  slow mover 


-  It will prove difficult to make the technology  routine part of software development 


-  The organization may end up locked into  stranded technology ,  finding it difficult to hire experienced staff: to purchase complementary tools ,  and in general to achieve the benefits that adopters of dominant process technologies enjoy 


-  ,  Having said this ,  in the immediate future ,  there will no doubt be  series of OO success stories  some genuine and others overstated for dramatic effect ,  as vendors and early adopters try to encourage  bandwagon 


-  Second ,  who did the development? Results achieved by handpicked internal stars or  team of industry consultants cannot be generalized to an entire IS development organization 


-  And finally ,  has the adopting company truly made the transition to routinized use ,  where OO has become the default technology for new applications? All too many software innovations end up as shelfware after promising pilot projects ,  because of the difficulty in replicating the success of one team across the entire organization 


-  ,  But isnt it desirable to be different from your competitors? Wouldnt being  first mover in adopting OO provide  competitive advantage as many proponents suggest? This is unlikely 


-  Publicly available technologies rarely provide  sustainable competitive advantage in and of themselves: they require mating with some other relatively unique organizational competence ,  otherwise all competitors would also adopt the technology and quickly close the gap 


-  ,  riding the internal learning curve sooner ,  building general innovative capabilities ,  and attracting leading-edge personnel )  could easily be outweighed by disadvantages  (  


-  ,  joining an immature network with high transient incompatibility costs ,  adopting an early and less favorable technology vintage ,  and experiencing  loss of trained staff to other companies )  


-  As  result ,  instances of first-mover advantages for corporate IS departments are likely to be rare 


-  ( For software vendors ,  however ,  an alternative scenario exists where heavy initial investment in OO could trigger  virtuous cycle of increased market share and resulting increased economics of scale 


-  )  ,  The framework we have described outlines the likely diffusion pattern at the time the ratings are performed 


-  The most appropriate time to perform the assessment is during the technologys first widespread commercial availability 


-  Having said that ,  such  move is probably unusual given the rapid arrival of new technologies and the inevitable loss of uncritical media attention typically bestowed on an emerging technology 


-  ,  On the positive side ,  better than expected growth in the demand for applications that fit well with the OO approach is likely to increase OOs relative advantage 


-  Thus  growth in multimedia applications and the demand for applications running in client-server environments would clearly help 


-  Favorable trade press coverage about OO success stories and the absence of widely publicized OO disasters would further improve the technologys observability and would improve the general level of expectations 


-  The ability of the Object Management Group to maintain the coalition and generate some initial successes on standards would solidify its position as external sponsor of the technology 


-  Additionally ,  wide-scale adoption of OO is threatened by growth from competing technologies ,  such as CASE  ( specifically CASE templates )  ,  which offers many of the same advantages of productivity ,  quality ,  and reuse 


-  Finally ,  the development of  newer ,  yet-to-be-announced technology could supplant the current interest in OO ,  riding the same wave of enthusiasm that currently benefits OO 


-  Some of these can be worked around with an appropriate adoption strategy ,  while others depend on communitywide actions beyond any individual adopting organizations control 


-  For vendors and other OO proponents ,  this framework offers  clear agenda for the future by outlining several avenues where an aggressive ,  coordinated effort is needed to lower obstacles to individual and communitywide adoptability
