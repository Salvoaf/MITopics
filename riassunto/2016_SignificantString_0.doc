- Business leaders are paid to make decisions and to ensure that those decisions are implemented in an appropriate and timely manner 


-  To do so ,  executives must clarify and determine their objectives ,  explore possible options ,  and evaluate which options are aligned with their goals 


-  ,  Many of the concepts and frameworks designed to help executives generate better choices are too complex or too specific to apply in day-to-day decision making 


-  In our experience ,  though ,  the real value of the matrix isnt just as an evaluation tool but also as  process tool that helps executives extend their decision frame beyond the obvious options and criteria and to think out of the box 


-  )  ,  By visually integrating the three aspects that are critical to making strategic choices  options ,  criteria ,  and trade-offs  the decision matrix provides executives with  tool that does more than simply help them evaluate  given set of options 


-  It also supports them at three key stages in the decision-making process:  (  )  framing key strategic questions and reformulating options and criteria ,  (  )  making concrete choices ,  and  (  )  engaging in dialogue with key stakeholders and communicating solutions 


-  Individually and collectively ,  people have difficulty passing up the first reasonable idea; they start analyzing the pros and cons instead of remaining in exploratory mode 


-  ,  The impulse to dive in makes sense for decisions that are urgent ,  low stakes ,  and reversible 


-  For other decisions ,  youre better off making [them] quickly ,  even if the decision is not the perfect one ,  and then adjusting down the road ,  rather than taking too much time 


-  One study found that in seven out of 10 cases the decision makers considered just one possibility 


-  The failure rate for these decisions was more than half ,  whereas when decision makers considered two or more options ,  the failure rate was less than one-third 


-  But determining the most important factors and the best ways to respond varies depending on the frame adopted 


-  For example ,   marketing specialist is liable to perceive  situation and the key stakeholders quite differently from someone working in finance; each person is likely to consider different criteria and options that will ultimately influence the choices he or she makes 


-  More concretely ,  executives are prone to develop myopia with regard to both the options and the criteria under consideration 


-  They are typically not even aware they have framed the problem in  particular way 


- 10 The country manager for Australia wanted $20 million from headquarters to pursue  new business opportunity there 


-  When the investment proposal was turned down ,  the manager considered resigning but was persuaded by her team to explore other ways of going after the opportunity ,  such as partnering with another organization 


-  Within  few years ,  the multinational decided to buy back the flourishing Australian operation and gave its management team  more prominent role in the region 


-   better framing would have been How can we pursue this opportunity in ways that are acceptable to headquarters? Fortunately ,  things worked out 


- 11 Adding one more option can prevent teams from becoming polarized and enrich the discussion by making people feel less inhibited about criticizing the preferred option 


-  However ,  Shells decision makers didnt appreciate the importance of public perceptions and emotions  they viewed the issue as  Scottish or U 


-  ,  To illustrate how the decision matrix can be used to stimulate out-of-the-box thinking ,  lets examine how an executive might evaluate  job offer or promotion within his or her existing company  something we have worked on with hundreds of executives 


-  When presented with  new opportunity ,  most executives start by weighing the professional issues  the proposed pay ,  title ,  and responsibilities ,  especially if there is no need to relocate 


-  In the process ,  though ,  many fail to think about other aspects of staying put versus switching jobs that could influence both how successful they will be in the new job and their overall satisfaction with life 


-  )  At first ,  Don viewed the decision as just  question of whether or not to accept the promotion ,  but after he visualized his matrix of options and criteria and discussed the choice with colleagues ,  several other options surfaced ,  including leaving his current employer and working at another local company ,  relocating to  different geographical area ,  and exploring job opportunities outside the corporate sector 


-  As he considered these options ,  additional criteria emerged 


-  Thinking about leaving the company brought into focus the personal benefits of his current situation that he would forfeit if he left; leaving New Zealand raised questions for family members 


-  Whereas Don was initially stuck with  myopic option set and unclear about what he wanted ,  introducing new options and criteria allowed him to step out of his overly narrow framing 


-  Out-of-the box thinking is not just about coming up with fresh options but also about gaining clarity on key evaluation criteria 


-  ,  Although Dons initial impulse was to accept the promotion ,  he ultimately decided to remain in his current job ,  with new responsibilities ,  additional autonomy and flexibility ,  and better compensation 


-  ,  By structuring and visualizing the option and criteria spaces ,  Don was able to clarify his thinking and identify what he wanted 


-  At the same time ,  he came to understand that certain career aspirations didnt align with his personal goals 


-  Most importantly ,  he saw that there was no silver-bullet solution that addressed all of his issues and that whichever option he chose would entail difficult trade-offs 


-  ,  Dons decision-making process around these difficult trade-offs is representative of what happens in other situations where decision makers attempt to take into account  broad range of views that need to be expressed ,  integrated ,  and evaluated 


-  To expand the decision frame in  systematic way ,  executives need to understand two concepts: mental buckets and golden cuts 


-  One effective way to expand your thinking is to ask: What if neither of these options were available?15 Presented with this question ,   person we worked with who was considering two job offers replied: Id become  mountain guide 


-  ,  Mental buckets are vehicles for clustering similar ideas into related yet distinct categories 


-  While brainstorming is  common way for teams to generate lots of ideas ,  at some point ,  ideas need to be organized 


-  For example ,  the possibility of noncorporate jobs highlighted factors such as time with family and job security that had previously not been part of the equation 


-  You may ultimately conclude that it doesnt make sense to think about noncorporate jobs 


-  ,  Every decision process for an important strategic decision should begin by examining the most difficult trade-off ,  something we call the golden cut 


-  We ask people: Where do you feel the most torn? or What dilemma is most difficult to resolve? For an executive contemplating  job switch ,  different first cuts might open up vastly different option spaces ,  such as staying in the current industry versus entering  new industry ,  remaining in the same geographic location versus moving to  new location ,  or continuing to work versus early retirement 


-  To find the golden cut ,  decision makers may need to reframe the problem by moving either up or down  level to identify the underlying tension 


-  For example ,  in the job search example ,  one level away from the corporate versus noncorporate decision is the choice between having  job and not having  job  which might be relevant for an executive envisaging early retirement or for someone who has sold his or her company 


-  Only later did he realize that his first cut was misplaced  it didnt reflect the requirements of his family ,  particularly his wife 


-  This allowed him to reconsider his perspective on the relevant decision criteria 


-  For instance ,  if you start  conversation about  potential new job using financial versus nonfinancial criteria ,  you might get instant pushback from family members who fear that their perspectives are not being considered 


-  If ,  on the other hand ,  you first point out that there are both family-related and personal objectives that need to be taken into account ,  it might lead to  more constructive conversation around different options and their respective trade-offs 


-  Being mindful about choosing and communicating the first cut on the criteria dimension is likely to create more openness and willingness to engage; the relevant criteria will be highlighted at the beginning rather than as an afterthought 


-  ,  Visualizing options ,  criteria ,  and trade-offs in  decision matrix and broadening the decision frame by pushing option and criteria spaces in systematic ways doesnt guarantee better outcomes 


-  More specifically ,  by helping executives work through their challenges in  more structured and systematic way ,  using  decision matrix to expand the decision frame can enhance decision making at three levels: clarifying your thinking; engaging your team; and generating buy-in from the larger organization 


-  ,  Using  decision matrix contributes to problem solving by rendering your thinking visible 


- 16 Articulating poorly defined thoughts and committing them to paper helps executives capture and organize their thinking and declutter their minds 


-  To this end ,  the matrix provides decision makers with an effective way to store relevant information so that they can devote their cognitive resources to the critical task of evaluating the relative merits of different options 


-  ,  Scholars have noted the importance of visual cognitive artifacts  ( such as mind maps ,  SWOT analyses ,  and decision matrices )  that extend the capacity of the brain to process information 


-  Once this underlying strategic logic becomes evident ,  it is easier to review and ,  if need be ,  reconfigure the frame by adding or changing options and criteria 


-  The goal isnt to quantify each option to the decimal point but to make sure that the priorities are organized correctly and that the reasoning is robust 


-   good way to do this is to score the options against each variable ,  with  plus or  minus sign for expected positive or negative outcomes and  zero or  question mark for neutral or unknown outcomes 


-  The scores signify  presumed causal relationship between the various options and the various criteria  allowing decision makers and other interested parties to think through why particular choices are expected to lead to particular outcomes 


-  It can serve as  starting point to share your preliminary options and criteria ,  to explore issues outside your own awareness ,  and to clarify what needs to be true for each option to be the best choice 


-  When used that way ,  the matrix accelerates the transition from individual to collective sense-making 


-  It offers an efficient way for others to grasp the scope and crux of the problem and to verify that everything important has been considered 


-  The matrix provides an antidote to self-censorship by maintaining  clear record of the factors considered and the presumed connections between choices and outcomes ,  enabling people to push back on any assumptions that are unfounded or incomplete 


-  When organizations begin applying the decision matrix ,  for example ,  its often the case that one option seems way better than the others 


-  It allows you to say ,  We already discussed this trade-off  but we decided to dismiss it 


-  It helps to keep everyone on the same page and builds  sense of participative involvement that is important for understanding ,  buy-in ,  and cascading the message to others 


-  ,  Beyond enriching the quality of decisions and sense of involvement ,  the decision matrix can also be useful for communication 


-  Having worked through the matrix ,  its often easier for decision makers to advocate  particular course of action knowing that ,  on balance ,  the choice was carefully considered 


-  However ,  if you can familiarize yourself with its underlying logic ,  you are going to have  much easier time explaining your strategy and dealing with potential objections 


- 18 Decision makers are often taken aback by the opposition they meet when they announce big decisions; stakeholders may doubt that other options were properly considered 


-  The matrix enables decision makers to share  sense of the deliberations and the way the decision matured 


-  In particular ,  it offers different communication options ,  depending on how controversial  decision is and how much pushback is expected 


-  ,  For relatively straightforward decisions where low opposition is expected ,  leaders can directly present their chosen option and explain why the decision was made 


-  It is better to first outline the most relevant options ,  discuss the trade-offs ,  and only then explain why  specific option was chosen 


-  Although some people may continue to disagree ,  this approach underscores that decision makers have considered  broad range of options and that the pros and cons of each option were acknowledged and sincerely debated 


-   sense of fair process increases the likelihood that critics ,  while potentially still disagreeing with the final outcome ,  will at least understand and respect why  particular decision was made 


-  Explaining the criteria and candidly highlighting their inherent conflicts and tensions  for instance ,  meeting short-term targets and securing long-term growth  helps people recognize from the outset that there may not be any easy answers or options 


-  ,  Even in situations where the decision ultimately proves incorrect ,  the matrix provides  record of the core thinking 


-  It reminds people of the options and arguments that were considered 


-  This information is critical for understanding where things went awry: Did you forget options ,  miss out on important criteria ,  or go wrong in the evaluation? Pinpointing why  decision didnt lead to the desired outcomes is  first important step for making better decisions in the future 


-  You dont need to use  decision matrix to expand the decision frame to make short-term operational decisions  for the effort required ,  the payoff will be too limited 


-  But for decisions that are strategic and ambiguous ,  and where internal alignment is important ,  expanding the decision frame can stimulate creative thinking ,  and the matrix can clarify which priorities ,  criteria ,  and trade-offs make sense
