- With apologies to Peter Drucker ,  it is no longer simply what you measure that determines what you manage 


-  Its how you discover what to measure that determines how you manage 


-  In industry after industry ,  we see innovative measurement systems leading to innovative metrics and new organizational behaviors that drive superior outcomes 


-  More organizations are recognizing that benchmarking and executive expertise dont always determine the best key performance indicators  ( KPIs )  


-  These data-driven companies employ predictive analytics such as machine learning ,  along with leadership acumen ,  to identify and refine key strategic measures 


-  More finely tuned measures lead to better alignment of behaviors with strategic objectives 


-  ,  Increasingly ,  business leaders are asking their teams: Do our metrics fully capture what drives value creation in our business? How can we use technology to improve our system of measurement  that is ,  how we create ,  assess ,  and use our metrics  to better discern these drivers and identify better KPIs? They are rethinking their approaches to measuring success ,  to developing metrics ,  and building organizational alignment 


-  ,  In the technology sector ,  for example ,  losing talent can constrain growth ,  and ,  conversely ,  retaining talent can enable growth 


-  Identifying and addressing attrition risks is therefore  strategic matter 


-  ,  For most of its long history ,  IBM relied on management intuition and HR data to assess attrition risks  until Diane Gherson ,  IBMs chief human resources officer at the time ,  recognized that predictive analytics could do  better job of supporting the companys retention efforts by helping managers focus on the talent the company needed most 


-  Under her guidance ,  IBM created  machine learning algorithm that can better assess which employees are preparing to leave the organization and offer recommendations to managers about what to do to keep them 


-  The algorithm analyzes dozens of variables and millions of data points to deliver an analysis that is far more accurate than pure management intuition 


-  Managers use the algorithm to identify the individuals to target for development conversations about cultivating skills and careers within IBM 


-  The algorithm delivers perspective to managers and workers alike about skills and career development opportunities that connect with strategic needs across the IBM portfolio ,  in areas like cloud computing ,  AI ,  and quantum computing 


-  ,  Whats more ,  the tool has helped change the content ,  tenor ,  and effectiveness of manager-worker communications 


-  Most managers now choose to accept the algorithms recommendations ,   dramatic change from when it was first introduced 


-  As of early 2019 ,  the improvement in attrition had saved IBM nearly $300 million 


-  In short ,  predictive analytics has changed not only how the company measures and manages attrition; it has also improved the alignment of behaviors  ( such as conducting development conversations )  with IBMs strategic objectives to improve skills and increase retention 


-  IBM would not have improved its retention outcomes to the extent it did had it relied on the old way of measuring and managing attrition ,  via management intuition and HR data 


-  ,  Predictive analytics can do more than improve the achievement of executive-determined objectives 


-  It can also create new success indicators ,  transforming how companies define performance 


-  Organizations that obtain substantial financial benefits from AI are 10 times more likely to change their KPIs because of AI than other organizations 


-   ride-sharing business offers  case in point 


-  ,  Early on ,  engineers at the ride-sharing company designed an algorithm to maximize revenue by matching driver supply and customer demand 


-  The algorithm looked at all the possible combinations of riders and drivers and picked the combination that would maximize revenue based on the ride being requested ,  where the driver was located ,  and all of the system dynamics 


-  Then ,  as engineers began using AI to test other ways to maximize revenue ,  one model discovered that optimizing conversion rates  the percentage of times  user actually ordered  ride after opening the app  would deliver more ride requests in the future 


-  More ride requests meant measurably more revenue than what resulted from the companys former emphasis on matching supply and demand 


-  Combining the best human insights with the computing prowess of machine learning ,  the company improved on  key strategic metric 


-  ,  The company continued to use its method for matching drivers and customers ,  but its approach to maximizing revenue now included efforts to increase ride orders after users opened the app 


-  It improved app usability ,  ran marketing campaigns to increase ride orders ,  and set new KPIs for ride orders 


-  The companys choice of measurement tools  such as machine learning  preceded its choice of metrics ,  not the other way around 


-  This approach ,  what  call predictive alignment ,  offers  fresh perspective on the changing nature of strategic measurement and aligning organizational behaviors with strategy 


-  In what follows ,   discuss several examples of predictive alignment ,  illustrate how this approach contrasts with traditional alignment approaches ,  and recommend several practical steps about how to advance predictive alignment in your organization 


-  ,  Predictive analytics can help identify new leading indicators of future customer behavior 


-  With these new indicators ,  new perspectives on customer behavior become possible ,  enabling new ways to create value for customers and businesses alike 


-  It can transform what business performance looks like 


-  At Experian ,  the credit reporting agency ,  executives recognized that customer conversion   traditional metric in its business  had become less effective at predicting desirable outcomes 


-  Under the aegis of the chief marketing and revenue officer ,  the company began using predictive analytics to establish  new set of metrics for consumer intent ,  engagement ,  and loyalty 


-  ,  While many Experian reporting mechanisms continued to measure conversion rates for transactions and orders ,  none of the new metrics pointed to  dollar amount or count orders 


-  Adding these metrics required  fundamental change to the companys culture 


-  One executive told us that the company spent two years changing the culture from one that was chiefly transaction-oriented to one that focused on understanding consumer intent and consumer values 


-  This shift prompted  new set of questions: How often do people come back? When they come back ,  what features do they use? How often do they lock and unlock their credit reports? The answers to these questions enabled Experian to prioritize investments among various features 


-  The shift also transformed the role of analytics in the strategic measurement process from one that simply reported on lagging indicators to one that also discovered  ( and defined )  leading indicators ,  such as customer engagement scores 


-  ,  With new metrics and  deeper understanding of the factors driving performance ,  organizational behaviors align around these new insights ,  setting off  virtuous cycle of learning ,  KPI creation ,  organizational behavior shifts ,  increased learning ,  and so on 


-   case in point is  coaching app from HR services company ADP ,  which emails feedback to workers who choose to use it 


-  This machine learning-based tool improved productivity among users at the company by an average of 10% 


-  More than 130 companies currently use  version of this tool 


-  Besides helping users ,  the coaching app provides managers with data about their direct reports use of the tool 


-  If using the tool becomes  leading indicator of future performance ,  additional analytics can determine which managers encourage or support employees to use it effectively 


-  Management might then be evaluated ,  in part ,  on whether they follow recommendations generated by machine learning about how to support these employees 


-  The coaching app becomes the source of new measures that beget new management KPIs that enable new management behaviors 


-  ,  To see the difference between predictive alignment and more traditional alignment approaches ,  consider Robert Kaplan and David Nortons work on the Balanced Scorecard 


-  Their approach offers what is arguably one of the most sophisticated analyses of the role of learning in strategic measurement 


-  ,  Decades ago ,  they argued that effective strategic measurement systems like the Balanced Scorecard incorporate second loop learning to refine and adapt strategic ,  functional ,  and individual KPIs by questioning underlying strategic assumptions and detecting and correcting errors in these assumptions 


-  For example ,  in Kaplan and Nortons Balanced Scorecard approach ,  strategic learning consists of gathering feedback ,  testing the hypotheses on which strategy was based ,  and making the necessary adjustments 


-    strategic feedback system should be able to test ,  validate ,  and modify the hypotheses embedded in  business units strategy 


-  Plus ,  it doesnt matter how hypotheses are tested and validated ,  just that they are 


-  ,  This approach fails to recognize the potential for large discrepancies in the quality of methods for testing and validating strategic assumptions 


-   strategic measurement system that lacks  predictive analytics capability may not effectively test strategic assumptions ,  including hypotheses about what drives KPI outcomes 


-  In the predictive alignment model ,  it matters how you test strategy-related assumptions: Simply having  strategic measurement system that tests ,  validates ,  and modifies strategic assumptions is not enough 


-  To combat this challenge ,  GE Healthcare uses KPI outcome data to develop new ,  more predictive KPIs for optimizing returns on marketing investments 


-  As one GE executive explained ,  Its actually boiling out the KPIs from the data rather than setting the KPIs to be measured 


-  Well try to derive KPIs from the data and then use that in order to do analysis for targeting purposes ,  in order to drive commercial impact 


-  Less sophisticated analytics ,  or management intuition ,  would not have effectively tested the assumptions underlying GEs marketing KPIs 


-  ,  Whats more ,  the Balanced Scorecard approach explicitly states that KPIs are set by senior leaders 


-  Predictive alignment is essentially  hybrid approach in which KPIs are both determined by senior leaders  ( ex ante )  and emerge from analytical efforts after strategy is set  ( post facto )  


-  If management focus and ,  for example ,  performance management systems are too rigidly bound to predetermined KPIs ,  this can subvert alignment around new KPIs  ( via delay and misallocation of resources )  


-  KPIs that emerge from predictive analytics applications require an entry path into an organizations overall strategic measurement system 


-  Leaders taking this approach to strategic measurement should keep the following directives in mind: ,   


-  With predictive alignment ,  managers are accountable not only for their performance on  given set of metrics ,  but also for how well the strategic measurement system itself can test existing strategic assumptions and formulate new strategic hypotheses 


-  Developing an analytics capability that can test and learn is itself an important objective ,  and its critical to support that with sufficient investment 


-  The upshot: Leaders need to hold themselves accountable for developing strategic measurement systems that can deepen their understanding of factors driving KPI outcomes ,  generate new KPIs ,  and adapt to new KPIs 


-  For legacy companies in particular ,  that requires  (  )  investing in new analytical capabilities;  (  )  designing new processes that coordinate analytical insights ,  KPI adjustments ,  and new operational behaviors; and  (  )  identifying managers who will lead these investments and create these processes 


-  The risk of organizational misalignment increases with unequal access to advanced analytics 


-   member of an analytics group for  professional baseball team who focused on stadium concessions bemoaned the unequal distribution of analytics talent and resources at his organization 


-  Unequal access to analytics can intensify cultural divides ,  foment worker dissatisfaction ,  and undermine alignment of worker behaviors with strategic outcomes 


-  Just as traditional alignment approaches have focused on cascading and linking key metrics ,  predictive alignment encourages the distribution of analytical tools  ( and expertise )  across organizational functions to measure progress toward  ( and reassess the utility of )  these metrics 


-  Include data specialists when developing metrics 


-  Leaders accustomed to sitting down with different levels of management to articulate metrics that advance  given set of goals should begin to include data specialists  ( such as chief data officers ,  business intelligence executives and analysts ,  or data scientists )  in these conversations 


-   key challenge is to integrate data experts with business managers who independently set key performance metrics 


-  ,  Oberweis ,   midsized dairy operation based in Illinois ,  was looking to expand its high-end dairy delivery service business to the East Coast 


-  As in past years ,  the CEO brought together his executive group  composed of veteran operations managers in charge of trucks ,  drivers ,  and milk transfer stations  to plan strategy and set revenue targets 


-  However ,  unlike in past years ,  the CEO introduced the team to  business analyst in the marketing department who persuasively argued that  different customer segment would drive more revenue 


-  The group subsequently shifted its growth plan ,  adopting new indicators of success 


-  Just as significantly ,  Oberweiss veteran operations executives began to seek out the data team to help with other issues after seeing the benefits of its customer segmentation insights 


-  Embracing predictive alignment changes strategic assumptions and metrics that realign organizational behaviors toward strategic goals 


-  Including data specialists does far more than help companies identify the right data to include in leaders dashboards 


-  Leaders need data specialists to help identify the right data flows and create governance systems so that data required for key metrics has  consistent meaning across organizational silos 


-  ,   companys system of strategic measurement is typically built to support objectives determined by leadership 


-  In this approach ,  how you measure is less important than what you measure 


-  Ultimately ,  what you measure  whether it is tracked in dashboards or mapped in three dimensions  reflects how you compete and align behaviors to strategic objectives 


- 11 ,  With predictive alignment ,  however ,  how you measure also reflects how you compete and align behaviors with strategic objectives 


-  Using predictive analytics can expand the purpose of strategic measurement: It enables the discovery of new ways to drive growth ,  in turn enabling new metrics and new behaviors 


-  Customer lifetime value or attrition means something quite different ,  and is more valuable ,  if you measure either with machine learning and big data sets 


-  Divorcing alignment efforts from  machine learning or predictive analytics program risks not only poor strategic execution but also suboptimal planning; it can be  competitive disadvantage 


-  Investing in how you measure can ensure that what you measure matters
