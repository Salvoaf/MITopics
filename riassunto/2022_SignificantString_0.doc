-  Even in organizations that pride themselves on rapid iteration and experimentation ,  most truly novel ideas either stall out at some point in development or lose their originality along the way 


-  How do you defy those odds? By adjusting collaborative behavior to meet the idea wherever it is in its journey from mind to marketplace 


-  ,  That journey entails four phases: idea generation; concept elaboration through tests or prototypes that flesh out the idea and assess feasibility; internal promotion to get the sponsorship needed to move forward with  product; and implementation ,  which involves finalizing plans and specifications ,  creating the product ,  and delivering it 


-  In my nearly 20 years researching creativity and innovation ,  Ive found that as an idea progresses from phase to phase ,  its collaborative requirements change 


-  )  Here ,  well look at how those needs shift and how innovation managers can help people adapt accordingly instead of relying on go-to connections and patterns of behavior 


-  ,  If novel ideas moved in  straight line from conception to completion ,  it would be easier for them to gain traction 


-  When this happens ,  an idea is likely to be stripped of its novelty so that  more mundane version can move forward with less resistance 


-  Novel ideas are inherently risky 


-  Thus ,  high-potential novel ideas tend to devolve into safer ,  less inspiring ones that ultimately get the green light 


-  By taking  more adaptive approach to creative collaboration ,  your organization can increase its odds of bringing truly new ideas to market 


-  Lets begin by examining the core collaborative needs of each phase of the ideas journey 


-  This builds cognitive flexibility ,  priming minds to make novel connections that lead to original ideas 


-  During idea generation ,  exposure to alternate points of view neednt be immersive 


-  ,  To understand why ,  think about the people you interact with most frequently or consider to be friends 


-  Although such relationships provide comfort and support ,  they are less likely than weaker ties to expose you to new ways of thinking 


-  ,  Close friends may actually be too supportive during the idea generation phase 


-  In another study ,  London Business School professor Pier Mannucci and  invited both friends and strangers ,  on campus and in the surrounding community ,  to come into our research laboratory so we could observe their conversations after assigning them  task: Generate and develop novel decor ideas for  university bookstore 


-  Participants worked alone and submitted their own ideas ,  but they were randomly assigned to talk to two strangers or two friends ,  one at  time ,  before they began their focused brainstorming 


-  We found that friends showed support by building on one anothers ideas  and people went forward with those ideas ,  even when they were not very creative 


-  Strangers ,  in contrast ,  exchanged  greater variety of ideas in their conversations ,  and people came up with more novel concepts as  result 


-  Even though participants deemed ideas more useful when they came from strong-tie interactions ,  independent raters judged the solutions generated by weak-tie interactions more creative 


-  We may intend to pursue novel ideas with equal rigor no matter who or where the initial spark comes from ,  but weak ties provide an edge 


-  ( Well go into detail later about how to do that and how to meet collaborative needs in other phases 


-  )  Its best to encourage one-on-one interactions rather than group discussions this early in the idea journey ,  when letting many flowers bloom makes it easier to find the freshest ones 


-   considerable body of research shows that teams generate fewer and lower-quality ideas than the same number of individuals working alone 


-  One problem is that people have difficulty simultaneously paying attention to teammates new ideas and coming up with their own 


-  Teammates tend to produce similar ideas when brainstorming together ,  and they get distracted by social niceties like taking turns when others are expressing themselves 


-  Ideally ,  innovators should engage in one-on-one interactions with weak ties to stimulate creativity and then generate ideas alone to maximize originality 


-  Activities include lab testing and prototyping to give the idea shape and assess its viability; they do not involve creating detailed blueprints or CAD drawings 


-  ,  For elaboration ,  the core collaborative needs are support and encouragement  the same behaviors that stifle creative generation 


-  Though beloved by its creator ,   highly novel idea inevitably has flaws that are clear to others 


-  But at this point ,  detailed critical feedback can prematurely squash the idea by highlighting barriers and undermining confidence in its potential before  fair case can be made for it 


-  The creator may take the criticisms personally ,  abandon the concept ,  and avoid sharing highly novel ideas again ,  not wanting to be perceived by decision makers and colleagues as being too far out there 


-  ,  Because of these risks  and because there isnt yet evidence that the idea could really take off  the creator needs courage to persist 


-  So keeping the idea moving through the elaboration process requires  constructive stance and positive developmental feedback in the form of suggestions and observations 


-  ,  Close friends can be excellent sources of support and encouragement in this phase by serving as creative confidants 


-  Friends tend to listen with an open mind ,  and even if the rough concept seems flawed to them ,  they are likely to provide encouraging advice and feedback that could help shape the idea into something with staying power rather than pick it apart 


-  In the study that tasked people with generating bookstore decor ideas ,  friends who provided input extended and built upon ideas rather than offering new ones 


-  For instance ,  they suggested additional color combinations or technological capabilities 


-  With this kind of feedback ,  creators were more likely to move forward and even expand the ideas novelty 


-  But when strangers continued to offer new ideas during the elaboration phase ,  creators abandoned their own ,  perhaps taking others contributions as  signal that their own ideas were flawed 


-  ,  Managers may be tempted to act as creative confidants ,  especially if they have  close relationship with the ideas creator ,  but they are not the best source of feedback and support during elaboration 


-  Research shows that they are less equipped than peers to recognize  creative ideas downstream potential 


-  The managers role usually emphasizes evaluating ideas through the lens of prior experience and knowledge ,  leaving little room for open inquiry and exploration 


-  And creators may assume that managers are always in evaluation mode ,  even if they dont mean to be 


-  ,  Although collaborative needs shift from strangers or acquaintances during generation to friends during elaboration ,  the two phases do have something in common: an emphasis on input from individuals rather than teams 


-  Groups social dynamics create unnecessary threats to creative ideas during elaboration 


-  For instance ,  our desire for social acceptance and our tendency to make sense of things based on social cues from others may cause team members to coalesce around  particular position that could summarily squash  novel idea while its still being defined 


-  When people dont contribute directly to the testing and prototyping ,  they can more easily focus on giving encouragement and support rather than providing tactical assistance ,  and they arent as inclined to engage in overly critical evaluation 


-  And anyway ,  the prototyping and feasibility studies dont require as much collaboration as the more extensive development work later ,  during implementation ,  when  team is useful and necessary to create detailed blueprints ,  for example ,  and to solve technical and specification issues that arise 


-  ,  The main activities during the promotion phase include selling the idea internally and seeking approval to blueprint ,  create ,  and deliver the finished product 


-  The creator or business manager pitches the idea to key gatekeepers ,  such as innovation panels or top management teams ,  who can provide political support and resources 


-  Persuading people to invest in novel ideas with minimal precedent is difficult ,  especially when many ideas are vying for support 


-   rich body of research ,  inspired by sociologist Ronald Burts structural hole theory about networks ,  confirms that brokers are well positioned to capture attention for ideas because their connections give them access to people and information that others dont have 


-  Their status as go-to sources of knowledge confers legitimacy and power 


-  The key is connecting those disparate pockets of people so that the idea and the opportunities associated with it will have more touch points throughout the organization 


-  ,  In addition to expanding the ideas reach ,  network brokers can help describe ideas in  way that will resonate for  variety of potential backers 


-  They speak the language of these circles and understand what matters to them 


-  ,  Once the creator has the necessary go-ahead and funding ,  the idea moves to the implementation phase ,  where the main activity is executing on the prototype or refined idea 


-  In addition to building and delivering the product ,  this often involves finalizing the plans that will allow you to fully realize the concept: developing detailed engineering specifications  ( such as CAD drawings )  ,  sourcing the materials ,  and outlining the logistical operations 


-  Of course ,  this work takes different forms in different fields  it doesnt always look like traditional product development 


-  ,  The primary collaborative need during this phase is for  shared vision that will motivate team members to persevere and overcome obstacles by giving each of them  sense of ownership 


-  To understand the optimal collaborative patterns in the implementation phase ,  think about how cliques work: In these dense groups of friends ,  each member has  direct association with every other member 


-  Theres no need for  network broker 


- 10 Members of  clique enjoy  great deal of trust and cooperation 


-  Their tightly woven relationships give them leverage to bring in line any behaviors that are contrary to group norms and expectations 


-  And positive sentiment is high: It feels good to be part of such  cohesive unit 


-  ,  Product teams can apply the same principles  trust ,  cooperation ,  social correction ,  and group cohesion  to implement an idea 


-  When individual members know they can rely on one another ,  are confident about one anothers intentions ,  and feel an intense commitment to the group and its work ,  they can embrace the creators vision and advance it in lockstep 


-  ,   call for teams that resemble cliques may seem like an invitation to engage in classic groupthink   cognitive trap that is associated with  strong desire for belonging and leads team members to fixate on the merits of  single idea ,  without noticing its flaws or raising alternatives 


-  Groupthink does cause problems during the generation phase ,  where  variety of perspectives begets novel ideas 


-  But during implementation ,  the focus is on getting things done; its time to converge on the chosen idea and make it work 


-  While cohesive teams with  shared vision can handicap idea generation ,  they generally have an edge with execution 


-  Plus ,  research shows that they are also quite capable of critical evaluation and objective decision-making once their high-level vision is established 


- 11 So  tight-knit team can think critically while building out detailed specifications and implementing ideas  and make better decisions as  result 


-  If group members all understand and support the goals of the project ,  theyll more effectively share information ,  work together ,  and overcome obstacles 


-  ,  Changing collaborative behaviors to meet shifting needs requires collaborative flexibility ,  but most of us rely repeatedly on our strongest relationships ,  no matter where we are in the idea journey 


-  In studies of  live-action role-play troupe and individuals in the lab ,  people disproportionately thought of their closest ties during idea generation ,  when these ties are not optimal ,  and tended to stick with the same ones during elaboration ,  even if they had large networks 


- 12 In fact ,  this tendency increases the more network ties one has 


-  There is no chance of talking to the right people if we dont even think about them in the first place ,  so innovation managers must help employees develop greater collaborative flexibility to meet the needs of the moment  and provide settings where this skill can be exercised 


-   offer several suggestions 


-  ,  Create spaces for independent thinking and exposure to different perspectives 


-  When youre just entering the generation phase ,  try to avoid asking teams to come up with novel ideas together 


-  Instead ,  have individuals generate ideas on their own before discussing them with the group so that independent ,  original thinking isnt immediately thwarted by the impulse to conform 


-  ,  Sometimes ideation naturally falls to teams  when  visibly joint effort is needed for buy-in ,  for instance 


-  If thats the case ,  invite outsiders to attend discussions and empower them to ask questions 


-  Even naive questions from someone with no stake in the problem or project at hand can push the team to process early ideas more objectively ,  nudge team members to reconsider closely held views ,  and lead to creative outcomes 


- 13 ,  You can also consider  team rotation program ,  where newcomers visit groups as guest members for  single meeting or for several weeks 


-  It takes guest members away from their regular responsibilities ,  but not for long  and organizations that commit to continuous innovation must carve out time to work on unfamiliar or unspecified challenges 


-  Give employees opportunities to share problems in need of creative solutions with colleagues beyond their immediate circle 


-  Think of structural ways to do this 


-  For instance ,  you might create an idea board or council ,  staffing it with  rotating assortment of members who listen to challenges people are puzzling over and offer observations from an outsiders point of view 


-  This sharing opportunity is good for the presenter ,  who might not otherwise be heard ,  but also for the board members ,  who gain exposure to employees and parts of the business they may not know well or at all 


-  Pixar has adopted  similar model: It assembles brain trusts of directors so that other directors can present challenges theyre facing with works in progress 


- 14 ,  Idea boards can also solicit solutions to problems they have identified ,  and they need not interact face to face 


-  Internal web-based problem-solving competitions are one way of sourcing ideas from colleagues far and wide who are unfamiliar with  particular problem or project and can provide fresh insight 


-  Once innovators have identified an idea theyd like to explore ,  encourage them to seek early input from close allies 


-  Recall that sharing highly novel ideas involves personal risk 


-  When no established precedent exists ,  others may think the originator of the idea is ill informed or lacks grounding or credibility 


-  As  manager ,  you can model this behavior by sharing ideas of your own with members of your inner circle and openly debriefing your team on what youre learning and gaining as  result 


-  For instance ,  you might ask an employee with  constructive disposition to serve as your groups creative confidant for raw ideas 


-  You would want to select someone who likes to encourage others and help build ideas rather than suggest new ones or dive into  premature critical evaluation  or at least train this person to provide the optimal balance of support and feedback 


-  It should be someone whose informal evaluations or impressions of the creator would not become an unintended barrier  maybe  trusted peer in another department ,  for example  ( if that persons manager is amenable and perhaps interested in having one of your team members help their group in  similar way )  


-  The idea is to provide an easy ,  psychologically safe way for people to spend  few moments sharing  core concept with  receptive listener so they can elaborate on the idea before sharing it more widely in the organization 


-  ,  What if the idea is simply  bad idea? Should the creative confidant encourage an idea that will never work? Yes! Organizational psychologist Jennifer Mueller ,  in her book Creative Change ,  describes the inherent difficulty of spotting and embracing high-potential creative ideas 


- 15 As mentioned earlier ,  managers in particular have trouble identifying these ideas ,  given their tendency to go into evaluation mode 


-  If you want to encourage novel ideas ,  its better to risk letting some bad ideas move forward into prototyping than to abandon good ones prematurely 


-  Save the critical evaluation for later ,  during promotion ,  once the idea has enough substance to weather the scrutiny needed to make  persuasive case ,  and during the early stages of implementation ,  when specifications are being finalized 


-  ,  Ideally ,  collaboration becomes more intensive as new ideas progress from concept to product 


-  Although innovators do need exposure to others for creative inspiration ,  that exposure should be constrained early on: During idea generation ,  one-on-one interactions with strangers or acquaintances promote open-mindedness and originality 


-  During elaboration ,  when ideas are half-baked and sharing them is risky ,  close allies and friends can give innovators support and encouragement to help them persist in the face of uncertainty 


-  As an idea moves to internal promotion ,  innovators have to connect with more and more people  in various pockets of the organization  to secure the resources and buy-in to proceed with  product 


-  Once novelty has survived development ,  getting in sync is the point  its what brings the idea home 


-  ,  As  manager ,  you can create the conditions to meet the shifting collaborative needs of innovators 


-  It doesnt require an organizational overhaul ,  though it is largely  structural challenge  mainly  matter of helping people make the right kinds of connections at the right times 


-  When thats happening consistently in  business ,  truly novel ideas have  fighting chance to make it to market
