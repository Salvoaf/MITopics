- No question ,  in  competitive global landscape ,  collaboration allows companies to serve exacting clients more seamlessly ,  respond more quickly to changing environments ,  and innovate more rapidly 


-  But when an organization tries to boost collaboration by adopting  new formal structure ,  technology ,  or way of working ,  it often adds  steady stream of time- and energy-consuming interactions to an already relentless workload ,  diminishing instead of improving performance 


-  ,  Think about the consequences at an individual level: Its not unusual to feel as if we are just starting our work at   


-  Thanks to the plethora of technologies that keep us connected ,  increasingly integrated global operations ,  and the need for  multidisciplinary approach to deploying complex products and services ,  the problem has snowballed over the past decade ,  with collaborative time demands rising more than 50% 


-  Most knowledge workers and leaders spend 85% or more of their time on email ,  in meetings ,  and on the phone 


-  Employees struggle with increases in email volume ,  the proliferation of new collaborative tools ,  and expectations of fast replies to messages  with deleterious effects on their quality of work and efficiency 


-  Research tells us that simple distractions like checking  text message fragment our attention more than we realize ,  and more consuming distractions  such as answering an email  can cost us more than 20 minutes to fully regain our focus 


-  ,  Even though employees are acutely aware that theyre suffering ,  most organizations dont recognize whats happening in the aggregate 


-  We can track an airline receipt down to two decimal places and create  whole infrastructure around compliance ,  but we have no idea how effective networks are or where collaborative time is being spent ,  lamented the CIO of one company we studied 


-  With increasing pressure on organizations to become more agile ,  there is also  greater tendency to swamp employees with collaboration demands in pursuit of  networked organization 


-  We have found that people have ,  on average ,  at least nine different technologies to manage their interactions with work groups 


-  The result can be overwhelmed and unproductive employees ,  sapped creativity ,  and employee attrition 


-  ,  Fortunately ,  it is possible to improve collaboration efforts with the help of analytics 


-  Perhaps the first industry to do so was professional basketball ,  where quantitative analysts realized that some players scored relatively little but somehow made their teammates more successful 


-  Similar analysis has been deployed by professional soccer teams to identify what patterns of passing were most effective for scoring goals under particular circumstances 


-  But the benefits of understanding patterns of collaboration can be reaped in all kinds of organizations 


-  Using analytics to make collaborative activities more transparent helps companies identify and exploit previously invisible drivers of revenue production ,  innovation ,  and employee effectiveness 


-  Analytics enables better management of what has become an enormous yet hidden cost for organizations ,  one that employees arent equipped to manage on their own 


-  ,  In our research on collaboration over the past decade ,  we have seen some effective uses of analytics emerge in two industry consortia ,  where weve identified whether collaborations are driving value or unintentionally consuming resources 


-  These organizations have gone beyond documenting simple collaborative activities  who talks to whom at what frequency  to systematically relating collaborative activities to key outcomes 


-  ,  In particular ,  we found five main ways in which companies derive value from collaboration analytics 


-  First ,  they scale collaboration effectively by deploying targeted analytics to connect critical roles  ( for instance ,  project leads and first-line leaders )  and to link employees engaged in similar work who are distributed across functions ,  units ,  or geographies 


-  Second ,  organizations improve collaborative design and execution by understanding how networks cross hierarchies and team structures ,  and by replicating drivers of success 


-  Third ,  they use collaborative analytics to drive planned and emergent innovation through networks that cross capabilities ,  markets ,  or functions 


-  Fourth ,  the insights they glean from analytics allow them to streamline collaborative work by diagnosing and reducing collaborative overload and removing unnecessary routine decision-making interactions 


-  Fifth ,  companies engage talent by using collaboration analytics to identify social capital enablers of performance ,  engagement ,  and retention 


-  Scaling collaboration effectively 


-  Most organizations have developed deep talent in knowledge-intensive core capabilities ,  but its much less common that those individuals with expertise are systematically connected to one another 


-  They can be far-flung throughout the organization ,  often distributed across functions ,  geographies ,  and P&Ls ,  which means that no single leader or unit is responsible for deriving benefits from their collaborations 


-  As  result ,  scale benefits are often very limited 


-  ,  Collaboration analytics ,  however ,  can maximize the benefits of scale in three key areas: ,  Take ,  for example ,  General Electric ,  which has an enormous knowledge base in its more than 300 , 000 employees around the globe ,  across nine businesses 


-  Prior to 2015 ,  GEs efforts to link distributed pockets of expertise were uneven 


-  We had bright spots where cross-business expertise sharing was working ,  but we were not consistent within and across segments 


-  Leaders saw the opportunity to improve collaboration across the company through new analytics-powered expertise communities 


-  The goal was to enable expertise integration in  natural way that would require little effort from the experts involved 


-  ,  Ranta and his team first developed  quantitative model to predict whether  given community was ready to share its expertise globally ,  on the basis of data collected about successful knowledge-sharing communities elsewhere in the company 


-  They calculated scores that reflected the maturity of collaboration among community members ,  their degree of mutual commitment to success ,  the extent to which their local technological environment would support  global community ,  and the level of support for  global community within their organization 


-  When the model predicted that  community was ready ,  Rantas team included that community in  new knowledge-sharing architecture featuring discussion spaces where experts could interact globally 


-  Those that were not ready were steered instead toward smaller and more focused structures ,  such as mission-based teams 


-  ,  GE used analytics to predict which community member would have the right expertise to answer each kind of question and ,  through industrial-scale software ,  to automatically distribute questions to the appropriate community experts 


-  For community management purposes ,  GE generated real-time analytics of collaboration patterns to identify the employees who were most engaged and making  difference across locations 


-  ,  As  result of this work ,  GEs expertise is becoming easier to tap ,  wherever it resides 


-  For example ,  GEs Renewable Energy business ,  with approximately 43 , 000 employees ,  has deployed 27 communities to connect individuals across hundreds of technical discussions that span geographical and business boundaries ,  collectively producing  vast array of solutions and learnings 


-  In one year ,   , 172 internal collaborators collectively solved  total of 513 customer problems ,  resulting in more than $1 


-  million of cost avoidance in productivity 


-  Analytics powers our processes ,  minimizes the human cost of helping each other out ,  and lets us tap into the thickest vein in the gold mine of sharing ,  which is human generosity and professional pride ,  Ranta noted 


-  Improving collaborative design and execution 


-  Team-based structures are common in organizations ,  but employees assigned to too many teams end up slowing efforts and creating significant disruption if they burn out and leave 


-  Collaboration analytics can help leaders determine where team structures are most effective ,  informing in-house training and generating best practices that help replicate those networks and tune teams for agility and speed 


-  ,  Lateral collaboration is particularly challenging in investment banking firms 


-  Despite often advocating  one firm culture ,  the hierarchies that grow under  partner often lead employees to concentrate all of their efforts within their teams ,  while time constraints further limit their ability to learn about solutions available from other partner silos 


-  This can lead client-facing teams to focus on selling their own solutions rather than integrated ,  holistic solutions that command higher margins and improve client retention 


-  ,  Executives at one global investment bank realized that this partner-silo structural dilemma was preventing their firm from catching up to industry leaders 


-  Through  network analysis ,  an analytics team quantified the number of revenue-producing ties among midtier team leaders to understand where integrated offerings based on bundles of skills were  and were not  happening 


-  The team discovered an asset that had been overlooked: mid-tier employees who enabled others to cross-sell services 


-  Compared with other employees ,  these hidden integrators had three times as many ties across partner groups ,  and their connections were almost five times more likely to link poorly connected teams 


-  Financially ,  these hidden integrators accounted for more than six times the average cross-selling revenue 


-  ,  But it turned out that in spite of their tremendous value to the firm ,  these hidden integrators were actually at risk 


-  Analytics revealed that they were underappreciated: Their impact on cross-selling was largely invisible to the company and not counted toward revenue generation 


-  Leaders quickly adjusted the compensation system to acknowledge their critical contributions 


-  ,  Perhaps most important ,  analytics revealed that these valuable integrators were successful in different ways 


-  Some integrators specialized in enabling many smaller transactions ,  so the firm freed up their time for this 


-  Other integrators excelled at enabling much larger transactions  ( more than $15 million )  ,  but because these occurred much less frequently ,  these employees had to be managed and rewarded differently for their longer-term efforts 


-  Driving planned and emergent innovation 


-  Innovation is inherently  social process ,  grounded in the creative friction that comes when people with different types of expertise and experiences pull one another in unexpected directions and arrive at something entirely new 


-  Understanding where an organization should stimulate innovation by building networks that bring together people with different kinds of expertise is not something best left to chance 


-  Collaboration analytics can uncover silos across capabilities that  if better integrated  could spur innovation and translate creative ideas into production-ready offerings 


-  ,  General Motors used collaboration analytics to do just that 


-  Radically new business models are emerging in the automobile industry for shared mobility ,  autonomous driving ,  electrification ,  and connectivity 


-  But despite these investments in GMs human capital ,  executives also recognized the importance of social capital ,  or the networks of ties that connect employees and amplify their individual capabilities 


-  To produce  dramatic increase in the companys agility and innovativeness ,  GM focused on creating what then-chief talent officer Michael Arena termed adaptive space   network of connections that link the entrepreneurial pockets of innovation within the company to its traditional execution-focused operational elements 


-  This began to chip away at historic silos 


-  Creating adaptive space required interventions around four different kinds of networks: idea discovery ,  concept development ,  innovation diffusion ,  and organizational disruption 


-  Although all were important ,  lets focus on the second stage  concept development  in which promising ideas were rapidly developed into emergent innovations 


-  ,  Arena asked the internal analytics team to study the networks of two development groups that transformed ideas into novel prototypes 


-  Collaboration analytics derived from network data revealed that the more successful group had  clustering coefficient  ( the degree to which  group consists of small ,  tightly knit subgroups )  that was more than two times higher than that of its less successful counterpart 


-  That way ,  they were able to concentrate on perfecting one thing at  time and make rapid ,  focused progress 


-  Through these ties ,  team members tasked with one aspect of development shared their advancements with members from other clusters in ways that helped combine local innovations into  functioning ,  broader automotive concept 


-  Interestingly ,  while the successful network had more internal ties ,  its members had fewer external ties to potential idea sources in industry or academia ,  so they were free from outside distractions that could hinder their focus on the task at hand throughout development 


-  The less successful development group had more external connections ,  which were valuable in enabling discovery of new insights but often led the team to hedge their development bets by simultaneously pursuing multiple different possibilities 


-  ,  The combination of acquiring skilled employees and ensuring that these individuals are properly positioned in the network has enabled GM to adapt faster to the disruptive forces that surround it 


-  Streamlining collaborative work 


-  As employees spend more of their time in meetings ,  on phone calls ,  and on email ,  collaboration analytics can play  powerful role in identifying where excessive connectivity is draining time ,  slowing speed to market ,  or hurting employee morale 


-  Collaboration overload can beset specific individuals or roles ,  and collaboration analytics can identify the situations where some people are collaboratively far less efficient than others in the organization 


-  Sometimes overload is created through excessively inclusive decision processes 


-  In general ,  overload occurs when more than  quarter of the people who interact with any individual employee report  ( through an internal survey )  that they cannot improve their own performance without more access to that individual 


-  ,  Perhaps nowhere is streamlining collaborative work more important than in the commercialization of new pharmaceuticals 


-  Commercialization occurs after most of the enormous investments required to develop  new drug have been made but before the product hits the shelves 


-  It is extraordinarily time-sensitive ,  with  single days delay costing the company millions in lost profits 


-  But drug commercialization is also incredibly collaboration-intensive ,  requiring orchestration among regulatory affairs ,  medical affairs ,  R&D ,  sales ,  marketing ,  legal ,  advocacy ,  manufacturing ,  and many other functions 


-  ,  Streamlining collaboration can have  direct and immediate effect on the bottom line 


-  The leader of  drug commercialization unit in one pharmaceutical company we studied discovered that truth after using collaboration analytics to identify opportunities to increase efficiency of routine decision-making ,  which often seemed to be taking too long 


-  The analytics team asked each member of the commercialization group to answer  series of questions about his or her network of collaborators ,  including how much time each spent in routine versus nonroutine decisions 


-  Armed with data about the estimated delay these types of decisions caused ,  the team used text analytics to calculate which categories of decisions delayed the process the longest 


-  ,  Focusing on each area of opportunity for improvement ,  leaders and their staffs drafted guidelines for optimal decision-making ,  in some cases developing decision-flow schematics to ensure that all parties involved knew the best sequence and timelines 


-  They revised governance principles and trained employees to push responsibility and accountability down in the organization 


-  ,  The analytics team also discovered significant variation in how much time individuals spent collaborating with certain roles within the unit and preparing for those interactions  ( what we term collaborative efficiency )  


-  Statistical analyses identified four specific roles in which individuals were acting in ways that they may have believed to be efficient but that did not adhere to any standardized best practice 


-  Those who were most efficient in those roles consumed only  small amount of time from each person in his or her network ,  while those who were least efficient consumed many times as much 


-  Subsequent calculations revealed that improving the latter groups efficiency could have  catalytic effect on the entire organization 


-  Simply bringing it up to average could free up more than 17 , 000 hours of collaboration time annually in the rest of the organization  the equivalent of almost nine full-time employees 


-  ,  With these insights ,  the unit was able to recoup thousands of hours and shave time off the overall commercialization process 


-  Analyzing collaboration in this way showed that changes were possible and desirable ,  and provided the diagnostic insights to help other groups in the company discover new and better ways of doing their jobs 


-  ,  Using survey-based data about collaboration is not the only way to glean useful insights about  companys collaboration inefficiencies 


-  Its also possible to extract collaboration data from existing digital sources ,  such as meeting and email data ,  as  by-product of other behaviors 


-   leader in the secondary mortgage market ,  employed  passive data collaboration analytics engine that enabled its analytics team to easily identify opportunities for streamlining 


-  One unit seemed particularly effective ,  and analysis of passive collaboration data revealed how those employees behaviors were different from others in the company 


-  This group had created  culture of empowerment and strong working relationships among employees 


-  For instance ,  they spent 56% less time in approval-related meetings and 29% more time on approval-related emails 


-  They also worked with greater autonomy ,  spending 20% less time in meetings where their supervisor was present 


-  And they were more focused when in face-to-face collaborations ,  having 40% fewer meeting conflicts and sending 18% fewer emails while in meetings 


-   rapidly developing set of collaboration analytics applications has emerged as  natural extension of the people analytics functions in organizations 


-  For instance ,  companies are doing the following: ,  Booz Allen Hamilton provides  rare example of the use of predictive collaboration analytics to not just anticipate but also improve employee retention 


-  The company had already developed  predictive attrition model based on data such as demographic attributes ,  work characteristics ,  level in the organization ,  length of service ,  and compensation and benefits 


-  The model pinpointed key attrition drivers and identified employees at greatest risk of leaving the company who might benefit from targeted interventions 


-  ,  Data suggested that the risk for turnover was highest following an employees transition to  new role 


-  Further analysis revealed that how an employee managed networks shaped the odds of leaving after  transition 


-  Mapping data about the size ,  reach ,  and quality of each employees collaboration network against attrition data uncovered different insights at specific tenure bands 


-  The analysis contradicted much of the traditional advice about networks  ( for instance ,  that  big network is always  good network )  


-  ,  Five categories of network-based factors distinguished employees who departed within two years of joining the company from those who stayed 


-  ( See Network Drivers of Retention at Booz Allen Hamilton 


-  )  The people who stayed were those who created more energy in their interactions with others ,  helped others find  sense that their work had purpose and mattered ,  generated pull  ( or demand )  for their talents ,  created diversity of thought through broader networks ,  and connected with  strong peer cohort 


-  On the basis of these findings ,  Booz Allen implemented  new onboarding program that focused on the specific network dimensions that were most likely to increase retention 


-  Follow-up analyses confirmed  significant improvement in retention as  result of the new collaboration training 


-  ,   second example involves using collaboration analytics to more efficiently and effectively assess performance management   key driver of employee engagement12  at  


-  Gore  Associates ,  an R&D-based product development company 


-  The companys flat ,  latticelike organizational structure empowers associates to decide which leaders to follow and also makes them directly accountable to members of their teams 


-  Without traditional bosses to evaluate performance ,  team members rate one another on their contributions  ( impact and effectiveness )  ,  which is combined into  ranking of all associates within their areas across the company 


-  The ranking system is then used to determine associates compensation 


-  The companys global growth meant that many associates were working on multiple colocated and virtual teams ,  with any single team aware of only  small slice of an associates performance 


-  As  result ,  evaluating contributions could take many days to complete for  single associate ,  particularly for those individuals who were central to the networks of performance in the company 


-  ,  Gore began to explore  more streamlined ,  two-pronged approach ,  using collaboration analytics 


-  First ,  automated surveys empowered individual associates to nominate network contacts who knew their contributions best 


-  An algorithm ingested all this collaboration data and revealed which associates were in  position to compare pairs of other associates 


-  All this typically took each associate 15 to 20 minutes to complete rather than hours or days 


-  Analytics run on the aggregated data set then produced rankings for all associates in the company 


-  Conservatively ,  we estimated 10 , 000 hours  year that our approach saved ,  but in reality ,  it was probably several multiples of that ,  noted team member Willis Jensen 


-  Equally important ,  the new process was still well aligned with the companys empowerment culture 


-  ,  Despite widespread agreement that collaboration is critical to achieving desired business outcomes ,  organizations have been flying blind on how to maximize that value under specific circumstances 


-  Too often ,  well-intended collaboration initiatives have actually been counterproductive ,  sliding into overload for key employees 


-  With collaboration analytics ,  we can begin to shed light on who needs to collaborate with whom about what ,  what types of collaboration yield particular results ,  and how collaboration affects employee satisfaction ,  performance ,  and attrition 


-  ,  Far beyond traditional analytics that simply provide descriptive ,  visual models of who talks to whom ,   new generation of collaboration analytics is emerging ,  with more predictive and prescriptive capabilities 


-  These analytics use advanced methods ,  including machine learning ,  to identify key data without requiring extra effort from employees and to relate collaboration metrics to  variety of business performance measures 


-  They have the potential to ensure that initiatives designed to help make your team more productive dont backfire spectacularly 


-  ,  These new approaches are putting collaboration analytics on an even plane with other important analytical tools in organizations 


-  They are bringing the decision-making power of data and analytics to human cooperation at work 


- Count-offs at the beginning of musical performances ,  whether verbal  ( One ,  two )  or symbolic  ( with  baton or  snap )  ,  are  fixture of live collaboration for musicians 


-  Conductors use them to establish tempo and feel ,  and to provide guidance on how to interpret the written rhythms  the patterns of sound and silence  that the ensemble is about to play 


-  ,  Similarly ,  in the workplace ,  leaders help set the beat for their organizations and teams collaborative efforts 


-  For at least  century ,  they have done this largely by planning working-group meetings ,  huddles ,  one-on-ones ,  milestone reports ,  steering committee readouts ,  end-of-shift handoffs ,  and so on 


-  Through 30- ,  60- ,  and 90-minute calendar meetings scheduled weeks in advance to prevent conflicts and at odd times to accommodate global team members ,  they have established the patterns of active interaction  ( sound )  and individual work  ( silence )  that form the rhythms of their employees collaboration 


-  Organizations now have  treasure chest of digital tools for collaboration  Slack ,  Teams/Skype ,  Chatter ,  Yammer ,  Jive ,  Zoom ,  Webex ,  Klaxoon  that they didnt have before 


-  ( The global collaboration software market was $8 billion in 2018 and is projected to double to $16 billion by 2025 


-  )  Add to that email ,  texting ,  and messaging ,  along with the meetings that havent gone away ,  and the math is telling: Research shows that executives spend an average of nearly 23 hours per week in meetings  ( up from less than 10 hours 50 years ago )  ,  while McKinsey estimates the average knowledge worker spends 65% of the workday collaborating and communicating with others  ( including 28% of the day on email )  


-  So collaboration has gone omnichannel 


-  ,  Indeed ,  given how hyperconnected most people are now at work ,  one might question whether they even have  rhythm of collaboration ,  not because they lack sufficient interaction  ( sound )  but because they lack any absence of it  ( silence )  


-  That observation prompted us ,  as researchers ,  to ask: Should organizations have  rhythm of collaboration that alternates on and off ,  or is more simply better ,  as people tend to assume? ,  Our findings suggest that alternation is essential for work that involves problem-solving 


-  As collaborative tools make interaction cheaper and more abundant ,  opportunities to think without interaction are becoming more expensive and scarce ,  yet they remain critical 


-  In fact ,  our research shows that when people trade  rhythm of on-and-off collaboration for always-on connectivity ,  they coordinate and gather information more effectively ,  but they produce less innovative ,  less productive solutions 


-  ,  Thats troubling ,  given current trends in the workplace 


-  By achieving more and more connectivity ,  humans are becoming  bit like passive nodes in  machine network: They are getting better at processing information but worse at making decisions from it 


-  In other words ,  weve designed organizational communication to make it harder ,  not easier ,  for human beings to do what were being told we need to do in the next decade or two  that is ,  differentiate our capabilities from the growing capacities of big data ,  automation ,  and AI 


-  ,  It takes more leadership  not less ,  as the trend toward flatter organizations and teams might lead us to believe  to create an effective rhythm that alternates between rich interaction and quiet focus 


-  Here ,  we explore what that means in practice for managers and draw on examples from organizations weve studied to illustrate how you can avoid common problems and establish an optimal collaborative rhythm for your team 


-  ,  When we solve problems collaboratively  whether were making strategic decisions ,  fixing operational glitches ,  or generating ideas  we engage in two categories of actions:  (  )  gathering the facts we need to generate and develop various potential solutions ,  and  (  )  figuring out the best solutions 


-  ,  Academics are not strangers to the study of problem-solving 


-  There is  large body of research about it ,  with contexts including recreational venues like adventure racing4 and escape rooms ,  simulated laboratory experiments ,  and real-world field research in the workplace 


-  But most of the research has focused on individual rather than collective problem-solving 


-  Even among studies of collaboration ,  few have looked into how much we want to have 


-  ,  So we headed to the laboratory to explore that question 


-  In our first study ,  we randomly assigned individuals to 51 16-person organizations  some more connected by technology than others  and asked each organization to solve  complex problem: Divine the who ,  what ,  where ,  and when of an impending terrorist attack  ( akin to the famous Clue whodunit game but with higher hypothetical stakes )  


-  Each organization used  platform not unlike the collaborative tools used in workplaces today: Through their computers ,  individuals could search for information ,  share it with one another ,  and contribute theories about solutions while the platform tracked all behavior 


-  ,  We found that connectivity had different effects on the fact-finding and figuring stages of problem-solving 


-  The same connections that helped individuals collaborate in their search for information also encouraged them to reach consensus on less-than-perfect solutions ,  making connectivity  true double-edged sword 


-  If we were to describe this trade-off more generically ,  it is the question of whether the task primarily requires coordination or imagination 


-  If there are acute coordination needs  ( for instance ,  avoiding redundant effort by ensuring we dont all look under the same pillow for the keys )  ,  then always-on connectivity is helpful 


-  If imagination is more critical ,  then always-on connectivity can make it nearly impossible to manage the creativity of multiple minds ,  which requires  balance between allowing those minds to learn from one another and enhancing the capacity of each one to generate fresh ideas 


-  Too much communication ,  and all the minds end up in the same place ,  focusing on the same types of solutions 


-  ,  Does that have to be the case? Do organizations and teams need to choose between being great at fact-finding and being great at figuring? ,  To further investigate ,  we returned to the laboratory ,  this time with the goal of directly asking whether deliberately choosing  rhythm of collaboration  ( that isnt always on )  could help 


-  We asked  number of three-person groups to solve whats called the traveling salesperson problem 


-  ,  For decades ,  academics have been using the traveling salesperson problem to study complex problem-solving ,  in part because the set of all possible solutions forms what is called  rugged solution landscape: If you were to visualize all options as paths up  mountain  ( where the altitude reached is the measure of success )  ,  getting from  good solution to  better one might require you to hike back down the mountain and climb  very different path 


-  So myopic decision makers  ( as we all inevitably are )  risk getting stuck at  low peak because they didnt see the higher peak before they started climbing 


-  This happens in the traveling salesperson problem because the choice of which city to visit next is constrained by the other choices made in ones route 


-  To find  better solution ,  one must often go back and reconfigure those decisions 


-  ,  In our version of the traveling salesperson problem ,  people attempted to solve it under one of three conditions 


-  The members of one set of groups never interacted with one another ,  solving the problem in complete isolation; members of another set constantly interacted ,  as we do when equipped with always-on technologies; and members of the third set interacted intermittently 


-  ,  Consistent with our previous study and other research , 10 we anticipated  and found  that the groups with no interaction were the most creative ,  coming up with the largest number of unique solutions ,  including some of the best and some of the worst in terms of total distance traveled to visit each city and return back home again 


-  In short ,  when isolated ,  they produced  few fantastic solutions but ,  overall ,   low average quality of solution due to so much variation 


-  ,  We also anticipated  and found  that the groups with constant interaction were the most consistent ,  producing  higher average quality of solution but finding the very best ones much less frequently 


-  In other words ,  when always on ,  they produced less variable but more mediocre solutions 


-  ,  Groups that interacted intermittently  with  true rhythm of collaboration  broke the trade-off ,  capturing the best of both worlds rather than succumbing to the worst of either one 


-  They preserved enough isolation to find the best solutions at least as frequently as the groups with no interaction ,  but also enough collaboration to maintain an equivalently high average quality of solution compared with the groups with constant interaction 


-  ,  Learning was  key factor: During periods of separation ,  people naturally struck out on their own and tried new and diverse approaches to the problem  but when they came together again ,  they could learn from these different solutions 


-  Even if the new solutions people found on their own werent effective overall ,  they often included  useful idea or two that could be learned from and recombined with other solutions 


-  In this sense ,  intermittent interaction created the conditions for collective intelligence ,  rather than relying on  few leading individuals to come up with the strongest ideas 


-  ,  Even people with the best solution at any given point in the experiment did better in an intermittent environment 


-  They were exposed to new ideas from their peers that they could use to improve their already good solutions 


-  And of course ,  people with worse solutions could adopt the best solution in the group as  new jumping-off point for their next period of solo solving 


-  ,  By contrast ,  people who interacted constantly had many opportunities to learn but fewer ideas to learn from ,  given how closely they hewed to group consensus 


-  Those who never interacted generated more  ( and more diverse )  ideas ,  but their isolation prevented learning from occurring 


-  ,  There are two key lessons for managers in those results 


-  First ,  when it comes to solving complex problems ,  collaboration yields diminishing returns  beyond  certain point ,  the average quality of solutions does not improve from more interaction 


-  Second ,  too much collaboration has its costs  you drive out the diversity of thought that is helpful for creating the best solutions 


- 11 ,  Clearly theres value in having  rhythm of collaboration rather than always-on interaction 


-  But how do you choose one and then put it into practice? Whats the equivalent of  musicians count-off by the leader of an organization or team? Here are  few approaches that seem promising in light of our research 


-  ,  The light switch approach: Turn it off  in cycles 


-  As with so many things ,  collaboration technology has simultaneously solved one problem  ( too little interaction )  and created another  ( too much )  


-  Our research and that of others12 suggests that its important to find opportunities to unplug not just off-hours but also during work 


-  Many of us eagerly anticipate the time we get to spend in the quiet car of the train ,  on an airplane with no Wi-Fi ,  or in  cabin that is just  bit too remote to be on the grid 


-  Leaders can provide that kind of time in the workplace ,  too 


-  While people are getting used to putting smartphones in  box on their way into  meeting  ( to focus on one form of collaboration versus another )  ,  more and more organizations are also creating coordinated unplugged times for heads-down work 


-  ,  Flicking the collaboration light switch is something that leaders are uniquely positioned to do ,  because several obstacles stand in the way of people voluntarily working alone 


-  For another ,  knowing what their teammates are doing provides  sense of comfort and security ,  because people can adjust their own behavior to be in sync with the group 


-  Its risky to go off on their own to try something new that will probably not be successful right from the start 


-  But even though it feels reassuring for individuals to be hyperconnected ,  its better for the organization if they periodically go off and think for themselves and generate diverse  if not quite mature  ideas 


-  Thus ,  it becomes the leaders job to create conditions that are good for the whole by enforcing intermittent interaction even when people wouldnt choose it for themselves ,  without making it seem like  punishment  ( such as  time-out from childhood )  


-  ,  In some companies ,  unplugging is enabled by physical spaces and norms that prohibit collaboration 


-  Meditation rooms and meditation coaches ,  for example ,  are on the rise  not just at Apple ,  where Steve Jobs introduced the 30-minute daily meditation break ,  but also at companies as varied as Google ,  Nike ,  Pearson ,  and Nationwide 


-  At Amazon ,  instead of jumping right into  collaborative review of bullet points on PowerPoint slides ,  meetings may start with people sitting silently while reading  memo ,  discussing the topic only after everyone is done reading 


-  ,  But its not enough to provide space and permission for quiet focus 


-  Cathy Engelbert said she realized how closely people watch leaders for cues when an employee leaving the company  ( someone she didnt even know )  said that she didnt want to be like Cathy Engelbert ,  working and available to interact with colleagues at all hours 


-  The employee had inferred this  correctly or incorrectly  from repeatedly seeing that Engelberts instant messaging status was online at night 


-  Unless leaders themselves visibly unplug ,  meditation rooms and their ilk may become the latest equivalent of the dot-com foosball table ,  getting used by people who are the most likely to be laid off during the next downturn 


-  ,  Other companies are placing stricter limits on the time colleagues can spend interacting 


-  At the Italian headquarters of one of the worlds top fashion houses ,  the office goes dark at 5:30  


-  ,  forcing an end to the workday 


-  In part ,  the CEO tells us ,  that is out of respect to the families who await his employees arrival home 


-  But it also signals an end to collaboration and  start to individual time ,  something cherished at  company that depends so heavily on creativity 


-  may be an unrealistic cutoff in many settings ,  leaders can apply the same basic idea in more targeted ways ,  for  shorter period of time or even staggered across individuals or teams ,  as was the case with Boston Consulting Groups Predictable Time Off initiative 


-  One of the most seminal academic studies of work time in the 1990s showed how  software engineering team could reduce their feelings of having  time famine and improve productivity by instituting  policy of mandated quiet time ,  when interruptions were prohibited 


- 14 Today ,  that simply means having work time when all our collaboration tools are turned off ,  taking us back to the days when we naturally had an ebb and flow of collaboration  individual work time punctuated by scheduled meetings and calls 


-  ,  Agile approaches to teamwork incorporate some of this intermittent cycling ,  given that they are organized into short sprints during which groups of people focus on solving  particular problem 


-  Harvard Business School professor Andy Wu and his coauthor Sourobh Ghosh have termed this iterative coordination 


- 15 The challenge is that ,  as one executive at  large financial institution told us ,  our sprints have gotten so compressed together that there is no downtime in between them 


-  Plus ,  just because  team is sprinting doesnt mean others in the organization wont interrupt individual members of the team with collaboration needs that have nothing to do with the sprint 


-  ,  Hackathons also involve intense collaboration for relatively short ,  predetermined periods of time 


-  Because they are often organization-wide events  or at least everyone in the organization tends to know about them  they are somewhat more immune to interruption by colleagues ,  especially when they are sponsored by senior leaders  ( which provides implicit permission for out-of-office auto replies )  


-  But hackathons offer space and time for collaborative innovation  not for quiet ,  individual work 


-  Leaders must find other ways of bringing that into employees day-to-day rhythm by literally or figuratively flicking off the lights at regular intervals 


-  ,  Executives have been counseled to be collaborative leaders and to set the example at the top that they want to see in the rest of the organization 


- 16 They have taken this message seriously ,  transparently devoting more and more of their days to in-person and online collaboration 


-  By role modeling such ubiquitous use of collaboration technology ,  business leaders have helped define an era of always-on collaboration 


-  It is now time to role model  more sustainable ,  productive rhythm of collaboration 


-  ,  Even some of the tools creators are advocating this approach: Ryan Singer ,  one of the first four employees at Basecamp ,   maker of project management software ,  has written  book  ( collaboratively online )  based on 16+ years of watching companies struggle with project-based collaboration 


-  In it ,  he writes that there can be an odd kind of radio silence during the first phase of effective project work ,  because each person has their head down getting oriented ,  finding the best approach ,  and engaging in exploration  doing what he calls legitimate work 


-  He claims that it is important for managers to respect this phase [because] asking for visible progress will only push it underground 


- 17 ,  The Fitbit approach: Track it to hack it 


-  It will not come as news to anyone that workplace collaboration tools do not just enable collaboration ,  they also track it 


-  The result of all the time we spend collaborating online ,  and increasingly in person ,  is  stream of digital exhaust that defines whats recently been termed relationship analytics 


-  )  ,  This goes beyond weekly reports on how much screen time weve had ,  instead capturing each individuals precise rhythms of collaboration with others in the organization 


-  For example ,  Microsoft now offers two tools that use email ,  calendar ,  contacts ,  and other Office 365 data to provide insights about collaboration: MyAnalytics  ( for individuals )  reports on how responsive you are to collaborators emails  ( on average and with specific individuals )  ,  reminds you to book focus time before meetings take over ,  highlights the impact of your after-hours emails on others ,  and so on; and Workplace Analytics  ( for an organization )  uses the same data ,  anonymized ,  to shed light on overall collaboration trends 


-  Ambit ,   spin-off of the team at the Stanford Research Institute that developed Siris voice algorithms ,  captures your voice profile and then ,  during times of active collaboration ,  can track in real time how well you and your collaborators take turns  ( total number of turns ,  average turn length ,  longest turn length )  and how each of your voices will be perceived by others  (  so-called tonal analysis that shows when each collaborator sounds fearful ,  angry ,  joyous ,  sad ,  analytical ,  confident ,  or tentative )  


-  Your device will remind you to make your collaboration more intermittent when your solutions seem to lack sufficient diversity and encourage you to come back together and learn from one another when enough diversity has been generated 


-  Artificial intelligence may help us improve our collective intelligence by coaching us on how to regulate our collaboration 


-  Just as our Fitbit encourages more physical activity by making our current activity levels visible ,  these tools affect our collaboration behaviors by making those visible 


-  ,  The design approach: Create enlightened collaboration tools 


-  Both solutions above rely on us to change our own behavior ,  and thats hard 


-  If it were easy to regulate our rhythms of interaction ,  we wouldnt be sleeping with our smartphones 


- 19 But the same tools that permit us to become addicted to interaction can ,  if designed well ,  also help us make it intermittent rather than constant 


-  Consider Slack ,   tool that was initially designed on the premise that all communications would be visible to the entire organization ,  encouraging immediate responses and constant connectivity 


-  Under tremendous pressure from its user base ,  Slack soon changed its stance and created private channels ,  which now account for  majority of the collaboration in most work spaces 


-  It also created  status function that allows you to signal when you are offline for one of any number of reasons 


-  Indeed ,  while we are not aware of any social enterprise software programs that initially offered  feature allowing users to indicate whether they are available or not ,  nearly all of them have such  feature now 


-  These changes allow for more off time and give tacit permission for more intermittent involvement 


-  ,  The next generation of these programs is trying to go  step further by improving the rhythms of collaboration in live meetings rather than replacing them 


-  Matthieu Beucher ,  founder and CEO of Klaxoon ,  intentionally developed Klaxoon with this goal in mind ,  because meetings themselves can be sources of intermittent interaction 


-  Heres how it works: Meeting participants connect to Klaxoon with their own devices  ( cellphones ,  iPads ,  laptops )  even if they are colocated 


-  They then select an activity  ( brainstorm ,  poll ,  questions ,  decisions ,  and so on )  that supports the groups immediate task or objective 


-  Depending on the activity they select ,  the tool sets  particular rhythm of collaboration 


-  In some cases ,  information and ideas are visualized for all to see immediately; in others ,  data is stored so that the group can make decisions after  period of reflection or ,  at the very least ,  after everyone in the meeting has contributed their views 


-  Beucher likens each meeting to  new song and says Klaxoon is designed to provide different tools to improve collaboration for different parts of the song 


-  As Klaxoon has evolved ,  it has given users more room for intermittent interaction 


-  For example ,  it now allows people to turn off the user-identification and time-stamp features so that they can collaborate on their own terms and avoid judgment ,  by peers or bosses ,  about when or how much they are or are not collaborating 


-  ,  The promise of the design approach to balancing separation and connectedness  of using technology to create constraints that permit ,  nudge ,  or enforce intermittent interaction  is to make creative and productive skunk works types of teams routine rather than rare self-organized phenomena 


-  For this approach to come into its own ,  however ,  we need to know more than we do today 


-  In general ,  the world has asked technology companies to create tools that enable collaboration as much as possible  and thats what theyve done 


-  How to enable intermittent collaboration is  different problem to solve 


-  The best ideas for doing so are most likely yet to come  perhaps after technology companies learn more about how the customers who buy and use their products create their own work-arounds to add intermittency to these tools 


-  ,  Sociologist Georg Simmel once wrote ,  Usually ,  we only perceive as bound that which we have first isolated in some way 


-  If things are to be joined they must first be separated 


-  Intermittent collaboration may be not only productive but also inherently human 


-  ,  And yet ,  to achieve it ,  we must overcome our equally human impulses to stay connected in  world increasingly marked by omnichannel collaboration 


- 20 Leaders can play  significant role in providing the policies ,  data ,  and tools to establish  productive rhythm of communication 


-  To return to our music analogy ,  leaders essentially do the conducting  but every team member affects how the collaborative rhythm is played 


-  Unless individuals feel safe to intermittently disconnect and see that behavior modeled and rewarded by the leaders around them ,  theyre more likely to stay too connected ,  no matter what their managers say they expect and what kinds of tools and opportunities they provide 


- Even though traditional companies find much to admire and learn from in the cultures of born-digital companies ,  some born-digital qualities are cause for concern 


- com ,  for instance ,  launches new businesses quickly and drives repeated efficiency gains in operations 


-  However ,  it is less admired for what can be seen as uncompromising relationships with publishers ,  partners ,  localities ,  and workers 


-  Uber is revered for its ability to innovate services with agility 


-  But many observers are dismayed by the ways it has seemed to dismiss regulators ,  exploit drivers ,  and ,  in  set of highly publicized incidents ,  fail to protect workers and customers from harassment 


-  ,  When Jonas Samuelson became CEO of Stockholm-based home appliance maker Electrolux in 2016 ,  he wanted to reignite innovation and growth by building  faster ,  more digital-ready organizational culture 


-  Yet many of the practices of Silicon Valley did not seem appropriate for his 100-year-old company or the social and business culture of Scandinavia 


-  Samuelson couldnt ask 55 , 000 employees to work 70-hour weeks and couldnt incentivize them with millions in stock options 


-  He couldnt fire people just because their core skills started to age 


-  He couldnt constantly redesign the companys processes and products  Electrolux makes hardware ,  not software ,  and customers expect to keep their products for many years 


-  However ,  he could drive  culture shift that would energize employees to generate more innovation and profitable growth 


-  He believed strongly that this could change Electrolux for the better without losing what was already terrific about the company 


-  Many companies are trying to embrace aspects of digital culture without exposing themselves to the less desirable elements of Silicon Valley startups 


-  Consumer electronics and appliances giant Haier has spent years transforming its culture in pursuit of greater speed and innovation while maintaining the efficiency and stability of its traditional manufacturing and logistics processes 


-  KBC Bank is adapting to fight fast-moving fintech entrants while complying with strict European privacy and employee protection regulations 


-  Leaders of Schneider Electric are pushing culture changes to play  major role in the rapidly evolving internet of things while still being  reliable provider of devices upon which thousands of office buildings and data centers depend 


-  How can  company become more agile and innovative without alienating its best employees or wrecking the best of its existing practices? And what does it mean to have  digital-ready culture? ,  Weve been studying these questions for the past three years 


-  )  Based on our findings ,  weve developed  framework to guide traditional companies in any industry 


-  It then involves adopting or refining  set of digital-ready practices ,  grounded in these values ,  which will shape employee actions and organizational performance 


-  ,  Contrary to much thats been written ,  incorporating the best of digital culture into  legacy culture doesnt mean sacrificing integrity ,  stability ,  employee morale ,  or  companys heritage 


-  And traditional companies arent the only ones that can benefit from this framework 


-  The insights also apply to startups striving to become mature and thriving businesses for the long haul 


-  This workplace truism is particularly useful for leaders contemplating  significant culture shift 


-  Often described as the way we do things around here ,  culture is  set of values and norms that guides human interactions 


-  Its present in the espoused values of management ,  the unspoken assumptions of employees ,  and the commonly accepted behaviors that have helped an organization succeed in its chosen environment 


-  The bad thing about culture is that it can root  company in past practices that no longer fit  changing world 


-  ,  Culture is harder to change than strategy ,  because much of it is unconscious 


-  Whats more ,  leaders need to understand  companys prevailing culture before seeking to modernize it 


-  If they suddenly direct people to do things that run counter to deeply held values ,  rational discussions can quickly devolve into moral diatribes 


-  But  few core values ,  such as high performance ,  freedom and responsibility ,  and context over control ,  drive the practices that power the companys innovation and growth 


-  Boston-based software company HubSpot has  similarly thick culture code deck ,  but  few characteristics stand out 


-  The company commits maniacally to its mission and metrics 


-  It always strives to obsess over customers 


-  The company is radically and uncomfortably transparent and asks employees to be unreasonably selective about our peers 


-  These dictums reinforce  hard-driving ,  constantly innovating workplace culture 


-  Company leaders worked extensively to shift from solely rewarding people for their individual contributions to recognizing the importance of leveraging the work of others 


-  Other important changes include championing curiosity ,  actively seeking to drive greater diversity and inclusion ,  and fostering  one company approach over  confederation of fiefdoms 


-  ,  We reviewed the management literature on culture ,  examined published frameworks and stories of digital companies cultures ,  and interviewed dozens of executives to identify  small set of self-consistent values and practices of digital culture 


-  We then conducted  survey of more than 500 digital and traditional companies to validate the culture framework and assess how the various elements of digital culture correlate with different types of self-reported performance 


-  )  ,  Recognizing the immense scalability of digital solutions ,  digital leaders typically focus on creating impact ,  assuming that profit will follow 


-  At their best ,  these companies revolutionize how people and organizations interact ,  reinvent industries ,  and break the power of entrenched gatekeepers 


-  Speed helps companies stay ahead of competitors and keep up with rapidly changing customer desires 


-  Openness encourages employees to challenge the status quo and work with anyone who can help them achieve their goals quickly 


-  Autonomy gives people the freedom to do whats right for the company and its customers without waiting for formal approval at every turn 


-  Together ,  these values can foster an engaged ,  empowered workforce where employees feel  personal responsibility to constantly change the company  and often the world 


-  ,  The values of high-performing digital companies frame their essential practices: rapid experimentation ,  self-organization ,  data-driven decision-making ,  and an obsession with customers and results 


-  )  Our research shows that these practices reinforce one another when theyre all in place ,  creating  unified culture that is an effective expression of the four key digital values 


-  ,  Heres one way to look at this: Autonomy means that workers have the latitude to focus on the tasks that they believe matter most to customers 


-  So why dont successful digital companies turn into unmanageable collections of solo artists reaching for the moon? By valuing openness and striving for big impact ,  these companies encourage people to seek out relevant data and expertise wherever it resides 


-  To achieve speed and impact ,  workers self-organize quickly to conduct experiments and achieve their goals ,  without worrying about  collaborators title ,  function ,  or organizational affiliation 


-  Moreover ,  openness ,  even to counterpoints or critical perspectives ,  leads to individuals and teams having more information and producing more effective solutions 


-  The emphasis on data and results ,  meanwhile ,  drives accountability ,  encouraging persistent striving for customer-focused ,  scalable results 


-  This system of interrelated values and digitally enabled practices can be remarkably effective when management gets it right 


-  ,  Traditional companies tend to share their digital counterparts focus on customers and results 


-  They differ culturally in how they aim to minimize problems through strict rules ,  drive integrity into all daily behaviors ,  and work to create stability for stakeholders 


-  ,  Amazon ,  for example ,  was seen historically as cultivating  high-pressure and argumentative work environment ,  believing that only the fittest should survive for the long run 


-  But that approach ,  which led to poor press and high turnover among certain groups ,  is starting to change: By experimenting with more schedule flexibility and explicit support for more gender balance ,  the company is now beginning to set  less cutthroat ,  more inclusive tone 


-  Google ,  too ,  realized that more stability for employees can benefit the companys stability; after internal analytics showed that new mothers were leaving at higher rates than other employees ,  it boosted family leave policies ,  reduced on-call demands ,  and achieved  50% reduction in attrition among these employees 


-  After HubSpot developed  reputation as  difficult place to work ,  with long hours and insensitive graduation announcements for terminated employees ,  the founders made changes to build more empathy into the companys culture 


-  Facebook has been widely criticized for its perceived indifference about user data privacy and informed consent 


-  Autonomy ,  experimentation ,  and self-organization can drive marvelous innovation but ,  in the absence of sound guidance ,  can also lead to abuse 


-  ,  The challenge ,  then ,  is to develop the elements of digital culture to promote innovation without sacrificing integrity and stability 


-  In fact ,  our research on more than 500 digital and traditional companies shows that striving for integrity and stability in  companys culture does not hurt self-reported measures of innovation ,  profitability ,  and customer satisfaction 


-  Thats good news for traditional companies ,  maturing digital companies ,  and millennial workers who now care as much about growing families and communities as they do about growing businesses 


-  Instead of ditching all past practices ,  traditional companies should try to create  digital culture that embraces the best of their legacy 


-  The greatest advantage of digital companies is the speed with which they create and test innovations 


-  Traditional businesses must try to cultivate habits of rapid experimentation and self-organization within  framework of data-driven decision-making 


-  These practices may feel alien to companies whose structures ,  values ,  and governance rules were designed for cautious stability 


-  Yet our analysis shows that rapid experimentation and self-organizing strongly drive measures of self-reported performance ,  including growth and innovation 


-  Moreover ,  organizations cant experiment effectively without the data to measure change 


-  Your customers ,  employees ,  regulators ,  and shareholders deeply appreciate these qualities and the practices that support them 


-  Thats why many successful digital businesses have begun to improve their integrity and stability practices as they mature 


-  The speed and interconnectedness of the digital world demands  new orientation to customers ,  results ,  and rules 


-  Asking customers about their needs must be supplemented by anticipating customer desires and proactively experimenting to delight the customer 


-  Infrequent and opaque performance evaluations must be replaced or supplemented by ongoing attention to transparent goals and performance metrics 


-  Wherever possible ,  strict rules and controls must give way to broader guidelines and transparent monitoring 


-  Employees who use rules to prevent change must be counseled to be more flexible 


-  For example ,  Google requires employees to follow strong technical and data standards but encourages innovation that builds on those guidelines 


-  Objectives and key results at the company ,  team ,  and individual levels are visible widely 


-  This transparency encourages higher performance and improves collaboration 


-  As recently as 2009 ,  DBS was ranked last of the regions top five players in customer experience 


-  Customers joked that DBS stood for damn bloody slow 


-  But ,  by 2013 ,  through  constant focus on reducing process failures and improving speed and customer turnaround time ,  DBS ranked first in customer experience among the same group 


- 11 ,  But that was just the beginning 


-  As we learned in our discussions with company leaders over the years , 12 senior executives envisaged DBS as  leading digital company ,  not just  leading bank 


-  Achieving this audacious goal would require further improvements in the companys technology platforms and product development processes 


-  DBS also needed to foster  digital culture ,  improving its innovativeness without alienating its best customers or risking regulatory lapses 


-  ,  CEO Piyush Gupta and CIO David Gledhill started promoting the idea of DBS as  22 , 000-person startup 


-  They wanted the existing customer focus to become  data-driven customer obsession 


-  The company analyzed 250 customer and employee journeys to identify process issues and then built analytic models to improve those processes and enhance employee performance 


-  For instance ,  by modeling demand in its ATM network ,  which ,  the company says ,  handled more transactions per month than any other bank in the world ,  DBS ensured that its ATMs never ran out of cash 


-  Another model developed to predict salesperson turnover proved to be 85% accurate ,  allowing executives to intervene and have  conversation with the banks top salespeople before they decided to leave 


-  ,  DBS leaders also encouraged ideation and experimentation at all levels 


-  They urged employees to identify ways to remove millions of hours of customer wait time 


-  Strategy workshops ,  daily briefings ,  startup exchanges ,  and  variety of other supports drove more than  , 000 experiments ,  many of which led to new products or improved services 


-  The bank also redefined internal processes to build agility in IT units and product development teams 


-  IT staff and business product owners now work closely together to rapidly develop ,  test ,  and refine products ,  increasing the speed and quality of product launches 


-  The company has removed more than 250 million hours of annual customer wait time and more than  million hours of employee wait time 


- 13 ,  In addition ,  leaders strove to build  learning organization where every worker can engage in continual self-improvement 


-  Experiential learning opportunities such as hackathons ,  job shadowing ,  and immersion experiences helped employees gain greater understanding of DBS itself 


-  Collaboration platforms ,  pop-up classes ,  innovation fellowships ,  learning days ,  fast-paced PechaKucha sessions  ( essentially rapid-fire presentations )  ,  and other methods enabled peer-to-peer mentoring 


-  It rapidly launches digital innovations to meet  variety of voiced or unvoiced customer needs 


-  Its customers are quickly shifting to cashless processes 


-  New products ,  such as  gamified mobile app to help parents teach children about savings ,  both test market opportunities and connect customers more closely to the bank 


-  ,  Another unforeseen opportunity emerged from the many process improvements identified by employees 


-  Automation and process changes had reduced costs significantly ,  but two processes  customer service and identity verification  still required employee actions 


-  In India ,  DBS used chatbots and the countrys biometric identity system ,  along with product simplification and some partnering ,  to create  digital bank that requires virtually no intervention from DBS employees 


-  At near-zero marginal cost ,  the digital banks processes make it possible to serve hundreds of millions of poor Indians who could not be served profitably by traditional banking processes 


-  People in digital startups tend to have  sense of purpose that goes far beyond the walls of the office and motivates them to work hard and innovate 


-  To start your digital culture transformation ,  create  vision that is bigger than your business 


-  Nike doesnt just try to sell shoes; it wants to be part of its customers lives 


-  It wants to be part of the conversation around any sport ,  any time ,  in any channel 


-  But by promoting  richer conversation around sports ,  Nike gets closer to sports fans  its customers  by making them feel they are part of  community 


-  ,  In the B2B world ,  Rio Tinto is redesigning mines with the goal that no miner will ever again work in  dangerous underground environment 


-  By improving the lives of its employees ,  it also increases efficiency and profits 


-  Other B2B companies are linking their work to end customers; employees feel more connected when they serve humans instead of companies 


-  At the office ,  apartment ,  or mall ,  Schindler aims to improve customer experience by having elevators that arrive when needed ,  provide  smooth and fast ride ,  and feature useful media and information 


-  That vision helps employees see how they help people ,  not just buildings 


-  As  leader ,  you must live the change you want from your company 


-  Identify company stories that broadly inform and reinforce these values 


-  Engage in open conversations so that employees can comfortably express their hopes ,  doubts ,  and fears about what might be lost ,  and so that unconscious beliefs can come into the open for discussion 


-  For example ,  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella encourages employees to transition from being know-it-alls to being learn-it-alls ,  underlining  new cultural emphasis on learning ,  openness ,  and empathy 


-  In meetings where managers make decisions based on experience or intuition ,  ask what experiments they might conduct to test their beliefs 


-  Make key decisions based on  diverse set of perspectives ,  including those of customers or partners 


-  Be transparent in rewarding people who engage in valued practices and in encouraging behavior change in those who dont 


-  One or two high-profile stories can yield  long tail of conversations throughout the company 


-  Not every unit of  company needs  digital culture 


-  Change is more urgent for units in dynamic environments like sales ,  marketing ,  or product development than for more stable areas like finance 


-  Even if you believe you need to revitalize culture company-wide ,  as Microsoft and Electrolux do ,  feel free to pay more attention to some units than to others as you learn what works best in your company 


-  Focusing on quick wins and high-potential opportunities can build momentum for broader challenges later 


-  ,  Consider creating  separate unit that can safely experiment with new modes of thinking and acting while staying connected to the rest of the organization 


-  Seeing  new culture successfully take shape in this unit can break down resistance elsewhere in the organization 


-  The digital units in companies as diverse as Nestl ,  P&G ,  and Lloyds Banking Group ,  for example ,  started as concentrated sources of talent ,  tools ,  and culture to drive digital innovations and then began to diffuse those practices back to the main company 


- 16 ,  Give people the chance to make an impact 


-  Even if they want to innovate ,  busy people often feel that they dont have time to do so 


-  Googles 20% rule makes it clear that every employee has the opportunity and the expectation to innovate 


-  But in practice ,  such policies dont reduce productive time by 15% or 20% but rather add an expectation that people will innovate on top of  full workweek 


-  You can change the situation by providing opportunities for employees to contribute in small ways that have  huge cumulative impact 


-  Innovation contests ,  hackathons ,  and recognition go  long way toward cementing the idea that innovation should be routine ,  not the exception 


-  At DBS ,  employees were encouraged during normal work hours to identify conditions that make customers or employees wait or to suggest potential ways to reduce wait time ,  even if they couldnt solve those challenges themselves 


-  At some companies ,  employees whose innovation suggestions are selected can get  temporary assignment to the team implementing the innovation before returning to their original roles 


-  Often ,  the best examples of rapid experimentation and self-organizing can be found in an unexpected place  the IT unit 


-  The best IT units have been experimenting with agile IT ,  where teams of tech and business people constantly self-organize and experiment to rapidly develop new enterprise software features 


-  Whether they practice agility or not ,  great IT leaders understand what gets in the way of innovation and speed and have tools to help 


-  They understand the difficulty of working with spaghetti-like legacy systems and can help you fix them 


-  But if you think your company doesnt ,  then its worth looking more closely to test your assumptions 


-  If they cant ,  you may need to transform your IT unit and its leadership so that it can support the kinds of change you want to see in your company 


-  Its also tough to work with people around the world without the tools that make collaboration easy 


-  For example ,  your employees need effective ways to download data safely ,  collaborate smoothly across locations and time zones ,  examine their customers journey in detail ,  or monitor  production process in real time 


-  Make these tools part of everyday work ,  rather than just another password to remember 


-  Dont set up your employees to fail by asking them to engage in 21st century practices using 20th century tools 


-  Is your company as transparent as your favorite digital company? Is it as successful? The answer to the first question shapes the answer to the second 


-  ,  In many organizations ,  the operations group is more transparent than other divisions 


-  Transparency around output ,  quality ,  and safety helps factory workers collaborate to fix problems and raise productivity 


-  Showing real-time performance in IT operations increases uptime and employee engagement 


-  In Chinese tech company Luculent ,  the front doors to many departments have screens showing the units real-time key performance indicators and performance to all passersby 


- 17 Transparency can raise productivity ,  help teams police themselves ,  and build greater understanding and trust across units 


-  Nonetheless ,  it can scare employees if they feel as though theyre under constant surveillance 


-  You can begin to overcome this resistance by defining KPIs that are truly meaningful and by clearly using the data for the agreed-upon purposes 


-  But ,  in the long run ,  true transparency is possible only with  sustained effort led personally by  companys top leaders that emphasizes the value of performance and innovation while reinforcing trust 


-  Launching technology projects is just the starting point 


-  The ultimate goal is to move from building systems and processes to building capabilities  building  culture where innovation is the norm and where employees constantly seek learning and growth ,  making the most of the best new technologies and techniques 


-  It promotes rapid experimentation with products and business models while staying true to valuable capabilities that help the company thrive 


-  Culture comprises  mutually reinforcing set of values and practices ,  only some of them conscious 


-  Shifting culture takes intense effort and sustained attention 


-  It takes constant adjustment to ensure values and practices remain aligned even as the companys competitive demands change 


-  It takes continuous performance management at all levels 


-  And it takes the commitment of everyone across the company to live by the culture you want to achieve 


-  ,  Developing  digital-ready culture does not mean doing away with all that is good in  traditional companys culture 


-  Combining  traditional companys assets and competencies with  digital-ready culture can be  winning formula for competing with fast-moving digital entrants in any industry
