-  ,  Enterprises that understand and embody the vital components of customer focus can move ahead in  way that makes it difficult for others to catch up 


-  Today the company is capitalizing on the growing numbers of cash-rich but time-poor customers who may have been loyal to cleaning products in the past but who now want everything cleaned for them 


-  They purchase the assets they want and self-assess performance as often as they like by monitoring their portfolios against all the major stock exchanges 


-  They can talk to other online customers their own age with similar problems and aspirations  or to customers who have already bought stocks from suppliers they are considering 


-  ,  So another vital component of customer focus is the ability to articulate and define the market space or spaces that the enterprise wants to occupy and in which it intends to dominate customer activities and spending 


-  ,   market space is ,  in  sense ,  an aggregation of all the customer-activity cycles in  particular segment 


-  )  In the travel industry ,  for example ,  the pre ,  during and post phases of  customer-activity cycle might include: first ,  deciding where to go and how ,  booking flights and getting to the airport; second ,  taking the trip ,  getting to and experiencing the destination; and finally ,  leaving the destination ,  finding transport ,  coming home and paying the bills 


-  ,  Any interruption in the flow of the customer-activity cycle creates value gaps ,  or discontinuities ,  that open access to competitors ,  unless the company fills the gaps first with value add-ons

-  Virgin is reducing seat size for its upper-class travelers in  belief that they dont need large seats at the pre and post stages but do want in-flight restaurants ,  lounges ,  and exercise and sleep areas at the during stage of the activity cycle 


-  ,  In the pre stage of the renal patients customer-activity cycle ,  the experience begins with symptoms ,   doctor visit and choosing treatment 


-  ,  Under the traditional customer-loyalty focus ,  companies tried to maximize volumes of core items to reduce the marginal costs per unit 


-  ,  Internet technology also keeps expenses level ,  no matter how many customers want  service at  given time 


-  ,  Why does customer focus lead to economies of spread? First ,  its information- and knowledge-intensive offerings reduce marginal costs ,  so that initial investments are amortized over longer periods and larger numbers of customers  than is the case with traditional customer-retention and customer-loyalty strategies
