- As service and product outsourcing become more commonplace ,  new organizational forms are emerging to facilitate these relationships 


-  Chase Bank has created shared services units that compete with outside vendors to furnish services to the banks own operating units 


-  Delta Airlines has established  business partners unit to oversee its relations with some 250 vendors and  , 600 contracts for ground crew and customer services at 186 airports around the world 


-  Microsoft out-sources almost everything  from the manufacturing of its computer software to the distribution of its software products ,  thereby focusing the organization on its primary area of competitive advantage: the writing of software code 


-  Still other firms are creating strategic service divisions in which activities formerly decentralized into autonomous business units are now being recentralized for outside contracting 


-  As these various approaches suggest ,  the best ways to structure out-sourcing remain the subject of ongoing management debate and media coverage 


-  Rather than issuing orders ,  managers must concentrate on negotiating results ,  replacing  skill for sending work downward with  talent for arranging work outward 


-  Thus ,  the outsourcing of services necessitates lateral leadership 


-  ,  We have reached these conclusions about the leadership capabilities required for outsourcing through intensive interviews conducted from 1997 to 1998 with 54 senior managers of twenty-five large firms in the United States and abroad and from  subsequent 1998 survey of 423 managers in  


-  companies  ( see sidebars about participants )  


-  What emerges from the in-depth interviews and the broader survey is  picture of  more demanding leadership environment ,  even as day-to-day management tasks are streamlined by outsourcing 


-  ,  Our interviews of senior managers at twenty-five companies revealed that four individual capabilities encompass much of what is now required of managers as outsourcing becomes commonplace: ,  Strategic thinking 


-  Within the outsourcing framework ,  managers must understand whether and how to out-source in ways that improve competitive advantage 


-  Outsource process managers must broker deals in two directions simultaneously  securing the right services from external providers and ensuring their use by internal managers 


-  After identifying areas suitable for outsourcing through strategic assessment and upon clinching  deal ,  effectively overseeing the relationship is essential 


-  ,  These four capabilities emerged repeatedly when discussing the essential skills of those responsible for outsourcing decisions ,  contracting ,  and oversight 


-  In fact ,  this repertoire of capabilities is probably also critical for joint venturing and other company initiatives that entail working across boundaries without direct authority 


-  ,  Our subsequent survey of 423 managers at  


-  companies corroborated the importance of these four components of lateral leadership for managing an outsourcing contract and relationship across  broad array of industries and company sizes 


-  We also asked these managers how much of  pay premium they would offer  person having all of the capabilities 


-  ,  Moreover ,  because the four leadership attributes constitute  bundle ,  managers who are willing to pay  premium for one capability tend to do so for each of them 


-  billion  similarly value the four qualities ,  although deal making brings the highest premium and is comparably valued regardless of company size  ( see Figure  )  


-  In most industries ,  lateral leadership capabilities command  pay premium  though slightly less so in consumer products and financial services ,  and considerably less so in the utilities industry 


-  ,  Earlier studies of information systems outsourcing touched on aspects of the four leadership capabilities we have noted 


-   detailed examination of thirteen such cases ,  for example ,  found elements of partnership governing to be essential 


-  Another study of sourcing decisions among forty  


-  We also found that companies require this unique blend not only for leadership in the outsourcing of information systems and component manufacturing in which many companies have pioneered ,  but more recently in an array of areas 


-  But certain types of work experience that foster such qualities may be evident ,  and managers reported  willingness to pay substantially higher salaries to those with such  track record 


-  Most of the surveyed managers were willing to pay  premium of  percent or more for previous experience in  (  )  outsourc-ing management ,  (  )  the activity being outsourced ,  (  )  leading of multi-skilled or cross-functional teams ,  and  (  )  joint-venture management 


-  For such backgrounds ,  one-third to two-fifths of the managers are prepared to offer at least an additional 10 percent salary  ( see Figure  )  


-  ,  Seasoned veterans in outsourcing ,  the responding managers confirmed the value of their own prior experience for their current work in outsourcing 


-  More than 80 percent said that their previous out-sourcing management ,  team leadership ,  and joint-venture management were of great value to what they are doing now 


-  ,  The four capabilities associated with lateral leadership are evident in day-to-day decision making as well as in longer-term initiatives 


-  Moments of decision by several managers  ( whose names have been changed )  illustrate the four capabilities in action 


-   first quality of lateral leadership is the ability to determine how the outsourcing will serve the companys strategy and gain competitive advantage 


-  ,  Though outsourcing is on the rise ,  company expenditures on outsourcing contracts still account for only  fraction of annual spending  ( see Figure  )  


-  While not  major preoccupation of most top executives ,  sourcing decisions are  critical component of many managers work days and the sole responsibility for some 


-  For both top executives and front-line managers ,  deciding which activities to be contracted out requires an understanding of the firms strategic imperatives and how to achieve them 


-  Strategic thinking is thus essential for making sourcing decisions at all levels even though such decisions constitute only one part of  far larger mosaic of managerial action 


-  ,  Consider John Thompson ,   manager at  leading  


-  telecommunications company ,  who is responsible for developing the firms outsourcing agenda ,   daunting assignment that involves more than $1 billion in hotly contested sourcing contracts 


-  ,  Thompsons senior managers have told him that cutting service costs and reducing management distraction are essential 


-  Theyve indicated that outsourcing must reduce the complexity of the companys management agenda ,  pointing out that some necessary functions consume more energy and management time than warranted 


-  Precisely where to reduce management distraction depends on the companys core competencies ,  defined in Thompsons words as something that gives us competitive advantage ,  something we are highly competent at as an enterprise 


-  ,  While ridding the company of peripheral in-house functions ,  Thompson studies the inside prospects and outside providers for handling integrated customer billing and concludes that we dont have the wherewithal to do that on our own in my lifetime 


-  Thompson identifies which activities are not core but are cardinal  ( and ,  conversely ,  which are core but not realizable )  ,  and he must have  sound appreciation for the companys strategic direction if he is to make the right choices 


-  Bank manager Susan Meyers says that the crux of the matter is understanding how customers make choices ,  and how we make money 


-  Accordingly ,  the bank is phasing out the high-volume but largely routine authorization of purchases and posting of charges ,  because transaction processing is akin to selling  commodity 


-  Most banks supply these services reasonably well ,  margins are thin ,  and little opportunity remains for outperforming competitors 


-  Customers make predictable choices ,  the bank profits only slightly ,  and outsourcing vendors furnish the services at lower cost and less aggravation to the bank 


-  Value-added services include credit assessment  ( identifying prospective customers as good bets )  ,  reward programs  ( linking card usage to airline mileage )  ,  and seamless service  ( integrating  customers credit card ,  checking ,  and savings accounts )  


-  In an era of mass customization for markets of one ,  the bank is retaining marketing functions in-house to focus on establishing and preserving customer loyalty 


-  And because the risk of outsourcing is perceived to be too high ,  the bank retains the function of reissuing stolen or lost credit cards 


-  As the manager who drafted the banks first sourcing contract pointed out ,  determining what to outsource followed  textbook prescription for attaining competitive advantage 


-  ,  Outsourcing managers create  web of relations between outside vendors and inside operations ,  brokering deals in two directions simultaneously: Securing the right services from external providers and ensuring their effective use by internal managers 


-  The leadership capacity required is comparable to what investment bankers bring to the high-stakes world of mergers and acquisitions: An uncommon ability to create common ground between prospective but wary partners 


-  Picking  vendor is sometimes compared to choosing  marriage partner: The decision can be extremely fateful ,  though the vendor relationship is shorter and the vows narrower 


-  One telecommunications manager had arranged three vendor contracts that she considered make or break decisions 


-  Shared services are most advantageous when they are managed company-wide ,  but this requires reclaiming the discretionary decision-making authority of the operating presidents 


-  Outsourcing thus often leads to partially recentralizing processes that had earlier been decentralized among business units 


-  Yes ,  our individual businesses are accountable for their bottom line ,  and we are eager for each to be productive ,  observed the CEO of the  


-  petroleum company in our study ,  but the well-being of one business unit may impede the well-being of the group or other business units 


-  To transcend such divisions ,  weve got to move forward as  team 


-  Outsourcing managers work doggedly to persuade the business-unit heads to accept services not entirely of their own choosing 


-  ,  Establishing the wrong terms in  sourcing contract can be as calamitous as overpaying for  company acquisition 


-  Fred Steinmetz ,   manager at  commercial bank ,  had negotiated  contract with  provider  decade earlier to support the banks vast credit-card operations 


-  Even with the database swelling to 15 million account holders ,  the contract language withstood the test of time 


-  ,  The steel company in our study opted for giant strides in outsourcing rather than incremental steps 


-  Were in the steel business ,  not the data-processing business ,  explained executive Robert Hunter ,  justifying the decision to outsource management of the firms information systems 


-  We recognized that costs were escalating in that part of our business and that we were incapable of managing them appropriately 


-  ,  Hunter decided to contract out part of the outsourc-ing process itself 


-  He hired several companies that specialize in negotiating contracts ranging from IT management to food-service operations 


-  ,  By contracting with the vendor on such  massive scale and prolonged basis ,  steel company managers supplied this particular vendor with proprietary information that could enable the vendor to service other steelmakers 


-  As positive inducement ,  he inserted incentives for the vendor to help the steelmaker further reduce its internal costs 


-  To monitor and thoroughly understand the firms information systems and to substantiate the vendors implementations ,  Hunter also retained  small ,  but dedicated ,  high-end staff of information technologists 


-  ,  Underestimating long-term problems in an outsourcing deal occurred at one of the commercial banks in our study 


-  For more than  decade ,  it contracted with an information service provider for all back-office processing of its growing credit-card business 


-  The full-service contract had worked well: The bank contained its rising costs and acquired fast-changing technologies 


-  ,  But the bank president believed that the deal may have been working too well for the vendor ,  because of  unique service capacity that the banks contract had allowed it to build 


-  When Visa and Mastercard change their policies ,  for instance ,  the bank informs the vendor ,  and the vendor in turn incorporates the new policies into its service for other banking customers too 


-  Moreover ,  the banks dependency on the vendor for so many services  ( more than  fifth of the banks annual budget is allocated to the relationship )  means that no other vendor knows the banks needs well enough to realistically bid on its work 


-  The downside of being joined at the hip: The bank has lost the upper hand in this vendor relationship and has also foregone any returns from what amounts to  long-term investment in the vendor 


-  ,  To effectively manage their outsourcing relationships ,  partners must not view  deal as one between armslength contractors ,  but rather as between locked-arm partners 


-   third quality of leadership ,  then ,  is adept governing of partnerships 


-  ,   partnership generally connotes the willingness of the two sides to work actively and constructively over time not only to achieve what is required by contract ,  but also to enhance the service quality and financial benefit to each 


-  Not all sourcing contracts lend themselves to partnerships: If the service is clearly delineated ,  relatively unchanging ,  and zero-sum in payoff ,  governance of the contract may require little more than enforcement 


-  But several studies suggest that when one or more of these conditions is absent ,  viewing the relationship as an enduring partnership yields superior results for both sides 


-  ,  The telecommunications firm in our study outsourced part of its retail customer care ,  including telemarketing ,  billing ,  and account management 


-  John Griffith built the enterprise from  desert start to  fully running system 17 days after the company committed to the deal 


-  He became responsible for the service product of  , 400 people  only 150 of whom still wore his companys badge 


-  The company initially forecasted 10 , 000 telephone queries per day from customers ,  but the daily tally soon climbed to 55 , 000 ,   staggering surge requiring three contractors to handle 


-  If you are in an entrepreneurial environment or when market conditions are highly dynamic ,  said Griffith ,  outsourcing is ideal 


-  ,  The telecommunication companys attorneys resisted the formal partnership label to describe the relationship since it connoted liability ,  but Griffith embraced the concept operationally ,  and he picked vendors who sought it as well 


-  ,   partnership implies an enduring engagement that survives and even strengthens with stress and conflict 


-  I want somebody who is with me for the long haul ,  said Griffith ,  who views every contact with providers as either building or eroding their long-term relationship 


-  Like customer-focused companies that treat every employee contact with customers as  moment of truth ,  he saw the most routine encounter with the providers and every decision about them as either helping or hindering his efforts 


-  He could impose stringent demands on the vendor as long as they fell within the terms of their contract; but he also knew that forcing compliance now would probably result in less responsiveness later 


-  During the summer of the contracts first year ,  an unanticipated downturn in customer demand resulted in fewer calls and higher costs 


-  By agreement ,  one vendor reduced staffing by relying on employee attrition; another reduced its service charges but not its staff; and the third ,  whose agent performance was most uneven ,  dismissed its least productive employees 


-  For Griffith ,  governing partnerships required patience and an eye toward the future: I dont want to win the battle and lose the war 


-  ,  In many firms ,  relationship skills are  prerequisite for promotion into positions that are responsible for outsourcing 


-  At  major computer manufacturer ,  for instance ,  the director of strategic staffing ,  Mary Jackson ,  described her ideal candidate to head  global operation with  staff of 700 and an inventory of $700 million 


-  She sought  deal maker and  partnership overseer: Ive got to appoint somebody who can be rigorous and analytical about determining what we do inside and outside the firm ,  someone who can choose the vendors and manage them so that  dont have hiccups 


-  ,  When asked to choose among two candidates ,  only one of whom had already managed an outsourcing contract or  joint venture ,  the candidate with sourcing or joint-venture experience was Jacksons unequivocal choice 


-  Is such experience essential? Absolutely ,  she says ,  its  requirement 


-  Even for the top marketing jobs ,  she wants people who can work to establish partnerships ,  joint ventures ,  and joint marketing arrangements 


-  Since so little outsourcing had been done in the past ,  few inside the company had the skill sets she required 


-  To refocus on the competition ,  top managers wanted to implement global sourcing with  limited number of supplier partners ,  and Jackson knew that this required going outside the company for the talent 


-  For most hourly employees and many managers ,  outsourcing is synonymous with job loss or change 


-  Employees of the express delivery company in our study viewed partnering with  provider as one step removed from consorting with the devil 


-  ,  Thus ,  it is not surprising that the labor union at  steel company with  recent history of outsourcing but  far longer history of collective bargaining has insisted on inserting restrictions on outsourcing into the union-management agreement 


-  The two parties recognize the seriousness of the problems associated with contracting out work both inside and outside the plant ,  the contract states 


-  The agreement prohibits the company from further outsourcing unless managers prove that the existing labor force cannot do the work 


-   manager at an old-line industrial company had sought to migrate all of his companys business units onto  new information platform managed by an outside provider 


-  He encountered deep skepticism among the business-unit heads ,  who wanted to do it their own way 


-  But he discovered that the most vigorous opposition came from the information systems staff itself ,  who feared their own job vulnerability 


-  They dont really want this to happen ,  the manager observed 


-  One key systems engineer ,  for example ,  saw problems developing during the changeover to the provider ,  but he remained utterly unresponsive ,  volunteering nothing about the problems except when asked directly ,  and then offering minimal response 


-  For example ,  managers at one petroleum company dispatched teams to visit forty-five companies that employed outsourcing for some functions they never imagined could be out-sourced 


-  Each six-member team was comprised of people from the companys exploration ,  refining ,  and distribution units 


-  ,  After their return from the company visits ,  the reconnaissance teams reviewed the various functions in their own operations 


-  After the oil company managers had identified opportunities to outsource extensively ,  they still had to overcome employee hostility and reverse their perceptions: We are not saying that people are doing things poorly 


-  However ,  the manager continued ,  outsourcing should be viewed as an opportunity to go out and look at doing things better 


-  ,  The individual component of leadership is what is conventionally considered leadership:  vision of the future ,  excellence in judgment ,  the power of persuasion 


-  The organizational component is what we often fail to appreciate at first but almost always find close behind: cultures ,  incentives ,  and relations that encourage the widespread exercise of individual leadership 


-  Leadership in outsourcing organizations requires both the individual and organizational components 


-  ,  Top management support for outsourcing is widespread ,  and most of the managers we interviewed affirmed that their sourcing efforts are surely doomed without it 


-  More than 80 percent of the surveyed managers report that their top executives back the agenda ,  and ,  by contrast ,  only half viewed their middle-management ranks as supportive ,  and virtually all deemed hourly employees as opposed 


-  ,   nearly universal dictum in outsourcing management is: Measure what you plan to source 


-  Leading  partnership also requires an unambiguous understanding of  shared path ,  so managers must be clear-minded about how they will judge the results 


-  In the words of  manager at one of the commercial banks ,  echoed by virtually every manager we interviewed: If you can measure it ,  you can manage it 


-  If you can manage it ,  it will get better 


-  By pinpointing responsibility and accountability in business units and their subdivisions ,  companies provide managers with the tools required to know if and when they are meeting their performance criteria 


-  ,  At one of the computer manufacturers ,  internal accountability was demanded of four autonomous business units ,  each required by headquarters to meet tough performance objectives 


-  The four units annually purchased several billion dollars worth of outside components and services ,  ranging from disk drives to travel tickets; they later jointly managed purchasing through  practice of shared services 


-  They manage the outside relationships via ten teams whose members are drawn from the line managers of the four business units 


-  Under the leadership of  top executive from one of the four business units ,  each team takes complete responsibility for arranging the sourcing deals and managing the vendor contracts 


-  Several of the teams oversee contracts with providers exceeding $100 million annually ,  and some are managing aggregate annual outsourcing deals worth $300 million or more 


-  To ensure that the business-unit heads drive the shared sourcing ,  the company gives them authority over team appointments and the annual performance review of team members 


-  ,  The company has invested full responsibility and accountability in the teams and their directors for delivering the products and services that the business units demand 


-  With well-developed metrics of performance ,  ranging from cost and quality to timeliness and responsiveness ,  team directors know when they are getting the results they require 


-  So ,  too ,  do the business unit presidents ,  and ,  since they are footing the bill ,  this provides the foundation for their continued support 


-  ,  Corroborating the importance of an organizational architecture that supports rather than undermines effective individual leadership ,  our survey of 423 company managers revealed that companies with higher rates of outsourcing  greater proportions of their annual expenditures allocated to outsourcing contracts  are also more likely to have adopted pay-for-performance plans and created profit-and-loss centers 


-  More generally ,  the data revealed  cluster of company practices that foster  climate conducive to outsourcing and its leadership ,  namely ,  top executive commitment ,  incentive pay systems ,  leadership development programs ,  and profit-and-loss centers 


-  ,  For companies sourcing their services and products ,  the novel blend of requisite skills requires fresh ways of recruiting ,  grooming ,  and promoting 


-  For institutions responsible for educating those who will lead the reconfigured activities  whether outsourcing ,  joint venturing ,  or work teaming  the new demands dictate new forms of management training as well 


-  ,  Our interviews and survey results revealed four critical capabilities on which management recruitment ,  training ,  and promotion should focus 


-  The study indicates that emphasis on these capabilities is widespread ,  and they are equally relevant whatever the company size or product sector 


-  Two-thirds of participating managers reported that they would boost  managers compensation by at least  percent if he or she had the requisite skills ,  and one-third would increase the salary by at least 11 percent 


-  ,  Outsourcing across  broad array of functions is  relatively new arena at many companies ,  and few managers boast rsums with more than  few years of experience in making deals or governing partnerships 


-  Experience in leading cross-functional teams or overseeing joint ventures is useful background 


-  However ,  companies with little work teaming or joint venturing may not find this collateral experience in their ranks 


-  Three-fifths of the surveyed managers reported that their company recruits some managers for outsourcing deals from outside the company 


-  And ,  in their view ,  the company must also invest far more in developing the missing skills during the years ahead  ( see Figure  )  


-  Management development programs can be expensive ,  but if their annual cost runs less than  to 10 percent of  managers yearly compensation ,  the investment is likely to be worthwhile 


-  Teamwork for developing products and focusing on customers also places  premium on working well with those you cannot command 


-  Top-level managers  whether of  division or  company  need much the same skills to manage relations with major customers ,  primary investors ,  and regulatory agencies 


-  Building the four individual capabilities identified in our study and the two organizational capacities  ( see Figure  )  is likely to facilitate not only outsourcing but also joint venturing ,  team building ,  and ,  more generally ,  executive-style leadership throughout  firm 


-  ,  The emergence of shared services units and strategic service divisions in many companies will further foster these leadership capabilities 


-  In gathering  range of sourced services under  single administrative umbrella ,  companies are seeking to exploit the advantages of larger scale and lower price 


-  The director of shared services  increasingly  de facto chief resource officer for the firm  leads an operation that resides partly inside and partly outside the firm ,  with neither part under authoritative control 


-  ,  Although the four desirable managerial elements are bundled ,  specialists do emerge who are strong in one or two areas but not all 


-  The strategic thinkers and deal makers ,  for instance ,  often delegate direct oversight of  contract to other managers ,  and the latter must be effective in governing relationships but not necessarily enabled in the other ways 


-  We noted that managers who place  substantial pay premium on one capability tend to place  high premium on all ,  and specialization in just one or another of lateral skills is unlikely to be sufficient in  world where complete leadership is more widely required and increasingly expected 


-  ,  During the decade since outsourcing has spread from manufacturing components and information systems into  range of other areas ,  many best practices in contracting and managing these relationships have emerged from front-line experience and academic research 


-  Among practices that transcend specific applications are: ,  Managers with the ability to think and lead in  lateral fashion ,  according to the present study ,  are also an essential element if companies plan to successfully implement these and other best practices 


-  ,  Department of Defense ,  for instance ,  writes  million pay checks per pay period at  cost of $12 per check; Automatic Data Processing issues 20 million pay checks per pay period for its contracted customers at  cost of $1 per check 


-   manager acquires the ascribed power of the position to hire ,  fire ,  instruct ,  and budget  ( see Figure  )  


-  Can the manager think strategically? Is he or she able to catalyze  restructuring of the operation to ensure that it facilitates rather than undermines partnerships with outside organizations? We agree with John Gardner ,  Noel Tichy ,  Warren Bennis ,  and other writers on leadership ,  who extol such personal qualities as vision ,  integrity ,  and determination ,  as well as the ability to organizationally delegate responsibility and streamline processes 


-  As outsourcing becomes more prevalent ,  distinctive individual and organizational capabilities conducive to lateral leadership are also likely to become  required part of the managers basic repertoire
