- During this millennium ,  many marketers seem to have bet the family silver on customer relationship management investments with little to show for it ,  and those marketers are now attempting to justify further investment in order to achieve their original goals 


-  To suggest that they have arrived at this uncomfortable place because they are regarded as unaccountable and financially innumerate ,  or that CRM technologies are immature and consumers simply wont engage with such new technology ,  is too simplistic 


-  The problem is more fundamental: Most senior management teams have an unbalanced approach to managing marketing investments ,  and this is particularly evident in the case of CRM 


-  They focus on the key resources in which they invest capital ,  such as technology ,  location and advertising ,  but ignore the commensurate investment of time ,  energy and talent to develop the capabilities required to leverage those investments 


-  Of course ,  this approach to marketing investment is risky: It generates excessive investment before the organization is capable of leveraging it profitably 


-  Do you remember how new forms of consumer relationships were going to revolutionize marketing ,  rewriting its rules and calling into question decades of scholarship and practice?2 Buying behavior would change as consumers used the information-rich environment to secure better terms of trade ,  personalize service and join online communities to cocreate solutions with suppliers 


-  Marketers ,  armed with perfect information about consumers ,  would optimize every marketing cent they spent generating  step-change in marketing effectiveness 


-  ,  Companies bought heavily into this new paradigm thinking: Between 2000 and 2005 ,  organizations spent $220 billion implementing CRM solutions ,  creating  market worth almost $50 billion per annum and growing in excess of 16% prior to the credit crunch 


-  Yet despite these enormous investments ,  publicly available data consistently show that 55% to 75% of companies fail to meet the expected return on their CRM investments 


-  So ,  have organizations collectively wasted $150 billion on CRM during this period? ,  Our research suggests that the problem is relatively straightforward: Companies have bought sophisticated new relationship management resources ,  such as call centers ,  databases ,  software and websites ,  but continued running their businesses as they always had done and assumed that customers would value the results of their investments 


-  )  Business leaders have also assumed that the marketing capabilities needed to interact with consumers in new ways to build more enduring and loyal relationships will develop as  natural consequence of investing in CRM resources 


-  ,  Our research suggests that successful CRM investment begins by developing the new capabilities necessary to improve customer relationships and then backfilling with capital investment as needed to sustain and embed the capability development 


- com  ( now  division of Betfair Group ,   world leader in the online betting market )  


-  In the case of Flutter ,   program of identifying its true marketing capabilities led it to invest in  less expensive and different aspect of CRM than it had first intended ,  whereas BMW  ( UK )  decided to delay its investment pending further capability development in relationship management 


-  Both companies aligned their investment strategies to the development of their marketing capabilities ,  resulting in reduced capital outlay and improved performance 


-  ,  So what is the interrelationship between  companys resources and its capabilities? ,  Customer loyalty cannot be fast tracked merely through buying companies ,  mailing lists or CRM technology 


-  Where CRM is successful ,  organizations learn from customers and craft effective responses ,  renewing and enhancing the value each side derives to  point where the relationship itself is  source of sustainable advantage and profit 


-  Engaging with customers and responding effectively does not develop automatically from investments in CRM technology solutions; it requires  sustained program of investing in and developing  wide range of resources  (  


-  ,  brands ,  distribution networks ,  supply chains and know-how )  in consideration of customers needs 


-  To achieve this ,  companies must have the capabilities to continually renew and configure resources in the service of ever-changing customer needs 


-  It is the combination of these capabilities and CRM technology that enables  company to develop unique propositions that customers value 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  most managers do not seem to hold to this holistic view: the need to invest in both resources and capabilities 


-  Resource-pickers identify resources that can be bought for less than their value to the company ,  while resource-builders generate internally the brands ,  customer relationships and distribution networks that create sustained competitive advantage 


-  For example ,  it is hard to conceive of  company with loyal ,  committed customers that lacks the capabilities needed to engender that loyalty 


-  We posit that during the recent period of massive CRM investment ,  managers have lacked  suitable framework for assessing and developing their marketing capabilities and ,  consequently ,  have tended to default to  resource-picking approach 


-  ,  Why is this so? Perhaps managers do not fully understand the nature of these capabilities; how can they be developed and made to work with CRM technology to generate competitive advantage? Capabilities are difficult to observe ,  let alone understand and manage ,  because they arise from the tacit knowledge of managers and employees: unstated how-we-do-things-around-here routines8 that are second nature to people within the company 


-  By definition ,  these routines and tacit knowledge are hard to document and transfer even within  company 


-  ,  The problem is compounded by our observation that it is unclear exactly who is responsible for ensuring the development of these new relationship marketing capabilities 


-  Research suggests that such process-led change programs are directed mostly by the IT function 


- 10 The marketing and sales functions typically sponsor investment in new CRM technology and write the business case; however ,  they generally lack the systems and process re-engineering expertise required to effect technology-led change ,  and so they defer to IT for implementation 


-  The initiative then becomes  technology project whose focus is selecting and deploying new technology ,  and it limits the development of relationship marketing capability to training marketers in using the new technology and business processes ,  rather than helping marketers carry out new and different activities that glean knowledge about customers and change consumers attitudes and behaviors 


-  The human resources function focuses on skills development of individual marketers ,  rather than addressing how the organization develops new marketing capabilities 


-  Training to use the systems is necessary but not sufficient; marketing capabilities originate within organizations through collaboration  they are not merely the sum of the individuals knowledge 


- 11 ,  Arguably ,  it is relatively easy for senior executives to acquire CRM resources; it merely requires money to buy software ,  people and systems integrators 


-  Resource acquisition is also time-bound; indeed ,   leading software company once advertised Global CRM in 90 days ,  and todays cloud-based vendors offer CRM virtually on demand 


-  It is far harder to build capabilities to manage customers better; the time frame is uncertain ,  and it requires organizational learning and the will to change what you do as  result of what customers tell you they want 


-  Companies that try to improve their marketing capabilities ,  such as enhancing their customers service experience to help build greater loyalty ,  often take years to see improvements 


-  The question then becomes: How do managers ensure that resource acquisition and the management capabilities needed to deliver appropriate returns on such resources go hand in hand? ,  From our research ,  we have constructed  framework and process for identifying and managing marketing capabilities that enable executives to develop their CRM resources and capabilities concurrently 


-  This framework is built on four principal marketing capabilities: ,  Demand management: generating revenue for goods and services; ,  Creating marketing knowledge: generating and disseminating  throughout the company  insight about consumers ,  markets ,  competitors ,  alliance partners ,  online communities ,  etc 


-  ,  Building brands: creating and managing brands for products ,  services and the organization; ,  CRM: developing how the company relates to consumers 


-  Our research suggests that the evolution of these capabilities is time-based and usually coalesces around three types of marketing relationships between companies and consumers: transactions ,  one-to-one relationships and networks 


-  During the 1970s ,  marketing was described as  series of transactions ,  commercial exchanges ,  between the company and its consumers 


- 12 The 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of marketing defined as long-term relationships between the company and its consumers: the one-to-one13 or relationship marketing paradigm 


-  More recently ,  scholars have identified  new network marketing paradigm14 flowing from online networks of the company ,  its supply chain15 and the consumers themselves 


-  ,  From this analysis ,  we built  marketing capabilities framework in the form of  matrix defined by two axes: the four capabilities cited above and the three forms of marketing relationships 


-  )  ,  At the time of our research ,  both Flutter and BMW were strong brands in their respective markets ,  established through  traditional marketing mix based upon strong product differentiation ,  powerful emotional benefits and excellent service 


-  Nonetheless ,  both faced challenges for which increased reliance on product-based marketing was not proving sufficient 


-  Changing competitive conditions meant there was  clear need to manage consumer relationships differently 


-  Neither team of managers was confident that best practice in CRM would be relevant to their particular circumstances ,  nor did they feel confident about investing large sums of money behind what for them was  new form of consumer relationship 


-  ,  Flutter offered  web-based means for consumers to negotiate bets  ( and set odds )  directly with other consumers and disintermediate traditional betting shops 


-  Flutter hoped that social interaction would create  unique community ,  locking in groups of consumers 


-  When it was launched in the United Kingdom with  traditional mass marketing mix of advertising and promotion ,  it attracted the largest number of online bettors in the market 


-  At the same time ,    


- -based competitor ,  Betfair ,  also entered the market 


-  Instead of encouraging bettors to find one-to-one matches for their bets ,  Betfair created an anonymous betting exchange whereby individuals bets  ( back or lay17 )  were aggregated and resolved through the exchange without individuals having to parcel bets for individual takers or even communicate with takers of their bets 


-  Betfairs exchange betting appealed to the serious gambler more than Flutters one-to-one betting 


-  Despite having more consumers ,  Flutter had only 4% of the online betting market18 by the end of its launch year against Belfairs 50% 


-  Flutters low market share was  major concern ,  because market share is vital for survival in this business 


-  Betting sites must be sufficiently large to accommodate bets quickly: Serious bettors will not waste time on small sites but instead will opt for the biggest or most liquid immediately 


-  Flutter needed to build liquidity quickly 


-  It had already decided to abandon its social networking strategy in favor of  Betfair-style betting exchange and was poised to reinforce its traditional mass marketing strategy in order to promote this in the marketplace 


-  ,  When Flutters managers first reflected on their marketing capabilities ,  they were sure that the companys capabilities were  mix of transactional and one-to-one marketing 


-  Its demand management strategy at launch was to use mass advertising and promotion to attract the largest number of consumers 


-  Marketing activities focused upon promoting individual product offers such as betting on horses ,  greyhounds and football 


-  There was no formal program of individual consumer development 


-  Flutter was contemplating further ,  expensive ,  investments in transactional marketing to address share erosion 


-  ,  As  result of these realizations ,  managers identified market-making pundits who had personal followings of other bettors 


-  This led managers to an important conclusion: Betting markets grow in step-changes led by the market-makers activities rather than developing in  smooth line of increased numbers of transactions 


-  The commercial director realized: If you can get 20 key customers [into  new product] ,  then they drive the liquidity and that drives the market 


-  Identifying and getting those people are critical 


-  They are almost stakeholders in the business 


-  We cant stimulate that; we need them to stimulate that [new business] 


-  ,  Flutters accumulated consumer insight into the behavior and liquidity management issues surrounding market-makers was more advanced than that of competitors; this was verified through  series of experiments 


-  Flutters CRM strategy would be built on this insight 


-  ,  With  clear picture of Flutters both current and future marketing resources needed to deliver the strategy ,  managers determined the future marketing capabilities required 


-  This process generated specific actions arising from using the framework across each of the four capabilities requiring limited investment ,  such as plans for collaborating with key market-makers ,   new customer services program ,  reinstating  consumer E-bulletin board and  new working relationship with product development 


-  By recognizing and appreciating the CRM capabilities that matter for its business model ,  Flutter was able to avoid what certainly would have been unprofitable expenditure in mass marketing campaigns and traditional one-to-one CRM programs 


-  Instead ,  it was able to scale its business with  limited investment in new technology 


-  ,  The managers efforts ,  coupled with the changes to their offer ,  improved performance dramatically ,  and Flutters market share increased more than sevenfold to 30% 


-  It was at this juncture that Betfair and Flutter merged to create the worlds largest online betting company at the time 


-  Under European Union legislation at the time  ( known as the European Block Exemption )  ,  no other company could import BMWs to the United Kingdom ,  nor could BMW  ( UK )  sell cars directly to consumers; all cars were sold through  tied network of dealers 


-  ,  The EU was reviewing the Block Exemption ,  and BMW  ( UK )  managers accepted that car distribution would be liberalized but were unsure to what extent and its likely impact 


-  In addition to potential changes in distribution ,  managers were considering the Internets impact on consumer purchasing behavior 


-  Would changes in consumer buying behavior render BMW  ( UK ) s dealer network obsolete? ,  BMW AG was considering  large ,  global CRM investment ,  yet BMW  ( UK )  was already three years into its own program ,  which was neither developed fully nor used to maximum effect 


-  managers were wary of further investment ,  but the division faced  dilemma: Should BMW  ( UK )  make its current program work before embarking on this new and even more ambitious project ,  or should it abandon its current program in order to participate fully in the new global initiative? ,  Aligned with these concerns was the realization among BMW  ( UK )  management that they knew very little about their  


-  consumers ,  apart from the data on the original sales contract and warranty information 


-  Virtually all consumer contact was channeled through the dealer network 


-  However ,  consumer information held by dealers was not systematically shared nor mined centrally at the time 


-  marketing department conducted regular surveys on satisfaction ,  brand image and service experience ,  this mostly generated aggregate consumer data and failed to provide  truly rich understanding of an individual consumers motivation and behavior 


-  Hence ,  managers felt vulnerable should the distribution environment change dramatically 


-  Equally ,  managers worried that they did not have the relationship marketing capabilities required to manage consumers directly across multiple channels to market 


-  CRM was seen as  means of mitigating those risks ,  reinforcing consumer loyalty and improving the repurchase rate 


-  ,  BMW managers exploration of marketing capabilities generated two scenarios ,  each with dramatically different implications for its CRM capabilities and hence CRM investment posture 


-  Within the conservative scenario ,  the dealer network remained the dominant channel to market ,  and BMW  ( UK )  would need merely to develop some elements of one-to-one capabilities to support  limited online presence commensurate with its view of BMW consumers expectations for direct access to the company 


-  ,  Under the managers radical scenario ,  online relationships would change consumer behavior ,  European legislation would liberalize automotive distribution substantially and there would be sufficient margin in distribution to attract additional investment 


-  Lower-cost and more interactive new channels would promote  very radical move from transactional marketing in each of the four capabilities 


-  However ,  creating marketing knowledge about individual consumers was seen as the lynchpin marketing capability upon which all the others relied 


-  Managers could not begin to understand how they could develop BMW  ( UK ) s capabilities for demand management ,  branding or customer management further without detailed knowledge of individual drivers motivations ,  purchasing behaviors and even the networks of influencers who might impact their decision making 


-  Even when they imagined that they could identify and relate to high-value consumers ,  managers found it difficult to conceive of how they would use that knowledge to influence consumer behavior and increase sales 


-  ,  BMW  ( UK )  managers had reached  critical juncture in their deliberations ,  and  fundamental disagreement remained about the practical application of consumer insight that would be generated through any future one-to-one or network marketing capability 


-  Without  more advanced level of one-to-one or network marketing capabilities with which to make this judgment ,  BMW  ( UK )  managers could not even conceive of ,  let alone implement ,   sensible CRM investment program 


-  ,  The impasse reached by BMW  ( UK )  managers about investing in new marketing capabilities and resources had profound consequences for its CRM investment 


-  companys existing CRM resources and capabilities to  point at which it could decide upon the merits of further investment 


-  ,  From our research ,  four key insights emerge for managers responsible for their companies CRM investment decisions: ,  Capabilities are the precursor of CRM investment and not vice versa 


-  The findings from our research are clear: If appropriate marketing capabilities are not developed ,  little or no return will be generated from investments made in CRM 


-  The evidence from Flutter and BMW suggests that the starting point for profitable CRM investment lies in developing marketing capabilities in advance of major capital investments in resources ,  particularly CRM technologies 


-  ,  Flutter achieved commercial success by moving quickly from transactional to one-to-one relationships and finally to network marketing ,  in advance of relatively small investments in CRM systems 


-  company could not conceive of how it would generate sufficient return on such investment and was unwilling to hope that the answer would come from as-yet unknown benefits of  CRM system 


-  Any business case would have been arbitrary and theoretical 


-  For BMW  ( UK )  ,  the CRM investment case would be more of an evolving view based upon ever-expanding understanding about how its consumers reacted to new direct relationship initiatives 


-  ,  As CRM capabilities evolve through managers learning from real-world experience in their markets ,  the business case and the exact specification of CRM resources become more evident 


-  Moreover ,  the learning process underpinning this capability development means that once the company does acquire significant new CRM resources ,  it will have in place  team of skilled and knowledgeable people ready to make the best use of them 


-  We suggest that companies invest enough behind  new CRM strategy to promote sufficient learning ,  development or experimentation to take them to the next investment decision: Do they invest in  major new CRM technology or enhance existing processes and systems? By deferring the very large investments in big CRM solutions until the business case is clearly proven  ( or not )  and the CRM teams marketing capabilities are evident ,  financial and business risks are reduced ,  and substantial investments are allocated only to proven ideas and teams 


-  The rate of organizational learning ,  rather than the size of the companys CRM budget ,  determines how rapidly companies can change the way they relate to  consumer ,  which ,  in turn ,  is linked to the length of the consumer purchasing cycle 


-  The serious bettors targeted by Flutter were on the site several times  day ,  every day 


-  Flutter managers could experiment with customer service initiatives ,  partner website deals and so forth and quickly measure the impact on their sites liquidity and turnover 


-  In contrast ,  changes in the marketing capabilities at BMW are likely to happen slowly ,  given their typical three-year repurchase cycle 


-  Hence ,  the impact of changes to marketing activities will only reveal themselves over an extended time period 


-  ,  Managers should be realistic about both the level of return and the time it will take to develop new capabilities 


-  It is our experience that CRM programs are all too often designed to meet  short-term horizon of  business case ,  removing time from those in charge of implementing CRM to engage in cycles of learning and reflection; instead ,  there is  tendency to develop future cash flows that indicate some immediate payback 


-  ,  CRM cannot always be driven top-down 


-  Preceding any discussion of CRM investment ,  top management must ,  of course ,  arrive at an understanding that managing different customer segments through different relationships is the right strategy for them 


-  However ,  the understanding of CRM capabilities and the ability to develop them are emergent rather than immediately obvious; thus it is not always possible to move through  traditional ,  linear strategy sequence of analysis-strategy-setting-investment case and new resource acquisition-implementation-evaluation 


-  Over time ,  Flutters managers became better and quicker at learning about consumers and were able to move along the continuum of marketing relationships quickly 


-  Top management can provide the money ,  software and authority to create  CRM program ,  but such investment must be informed by cycles of learning from consumer insight 


-  ,  If CRM investment strategy is to be capability-led ,  then it follows that those managers with direct responsibility for consumer insight and relations will lead both the learning and subsequent specification of the resources needed for CRM investment 


-  Top management should encourage teams of consumer relationship managers to experiment and then monitor the extent to which each team is making progress 


-  These teams can then come back to top management when they need further investment or organizational changes to support further learning and development of their CRM programs 


-  ,  Top management must ensure that the organization is capable of supporting such an evolutionary approach to CRM investment decision making 


-  We speculate that well-structured ,  command-and-control-style companies that demand  full-blown ,  evidence-based business case too early in the CRM development process will inhibit the cycles of learning and action that permit operational managers to guide CRM investments intelligently through experimentation and evaluation 


-  Thus ,  rather than seeking  particular organizational structure that will promote CRM ,  we believe that an organizational culture that tolerates experimentation will be more successful at building new CRM capabilities 


-  ,  Hard work and commitment are what it takes to develop marketing capabilities 


-  Perhaps the most encouraging finding from our research is that the marketing capabilities linked to CRM are far from being  black box and can be developed through conscious ,  goal-directed learning by those responsible for CRM 


-  ,  Flutters marketing management was directly involved in the details of CRM by understanding individual bettors behavior and identifying key market-makers and their networks of followers 


-  They maintained  constant vigilance on site liquidity ,  adjusting the sites inflow of visitors as much as possible to ensure  balance of backing and laying ,  winning and losing ,  and this occurred across different betting products 


-  They did not merely know about consumer behavior  they knew their consumers 


-  BMW  ( UK )  traditionally relied upon survey data to know about consumers ,  rather than knowing their consumers 


-  It realized that in order to develop its one-to-one marketing capabilities ,  it would first need to take consumer relationships and their interaction in-house in order to start talking to individual consumers and to learn from the experience 


-  ,  So ,  why is it that so many large ,  well-managed and well-resourced companies fail to see adequate return on their CRM investments? We argue that it is precisely because these leading companies are usually so well endowed with resources that they rush too quickly into large-scale ,  IT-based CRM investments ,  seduced by best practice and management fashion 


-  Somehow ,  the capabilities needed to support these resource investments get forgotten 


-  The top team needs patience and the courage to eschew neat global solutions ,  consultants best practice models and their own preference for immediate results by allowing marketing capabilities to develop and lead CRM investments
