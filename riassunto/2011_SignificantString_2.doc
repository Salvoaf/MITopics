- From  business perspective  ( not to mention other perspectives )  ,  certain current events havent treated sustainability kindly 


-  Where do they say sustainability fits on top managements agenda? What sustainability approaches correlate with top competitive performance? And what does the C-suite think? ,  Here ,  in charts and notes ,  is  first look at what this years Sustainability  Innovation Study has begun to reveal 


-  Are these strategic intentions  reflection of deepening commitment to sustainability ,  or are they  broader sign that business spending in general is accelerating out of the downturn? ,  Results of other questions in the survey seem to confirm  growing sense that sustainability demands strategic attention 


-  Sustainability experts are more than two times as likely as sustainability novices to say that on the agenda of top management sustainability is already  permanent fixture and core strategic consideration 


-  ,  On average ,  though ,  the biggest cohort of respondents said they consider sustainability here to stay but not central 


-  Respondents at very large companies indicated sustainability was  much bigger concern than those at smaller companies 


-  ,  Novices are by far the most likely respondents to say sustainability is  temporary concern or even that at their organizations it is never considered for the agenda 


-  In contrast ,  results throughout the survey suggest that for experts whose businesses have already begun acting on sustainability-driven strategies ,  sustainability is  sort of perpetual motion machine  the more they do ,  the more they learn ,  the more advantages they achieve ,  and the more they realize that there is more to do 


-  ,  Some experts argue that this gap between embracers and cautious adopters presents  challenging and consequential question for CEOs 


-  Does the divergence of opinion between experts and novices reflect  fundamental disagreement about sustainabilitys significance ,  or do those opinions simply illustrate how views naturally evolve as managers learn more? If the latter ,  then there are easy-to-spot educational solutions 


-  ,  As executive thought leaders frequently argued in Sustainability  Innovation Study interviews ,  its possible that the biggest competitive benefits of sustainability strategies are intangible: employee engagement and productivity increase ,  talent is attracted ,  there are halo effects from increases in reputation among customers ,  investors or other stakeholders 


-  But how well are companies measuring the costs and benefits of their sustainability efforts? And to what extent do executives include intangibles and other qualitative information in their decision-making processes? ,  According to our survey ,  most executives continue to struggle in this area ,  preferring to make decisions on the things they can quantify using traditional tools 


-  The difficulty of quantifying costs and benefits of sustainability-related strategies and the difficulty of developing comprehensive metrics for assessing sustainability impacts are two of the most frequently cited obstacles for why its so challenging to make the business case for sustainability 


-  ,  As for the numbers ,  only one in five say they use intangibles or other qualitative factors in sustainability-related investment decisions; even fewer consider lower hurdle rates or longer payback periods for sustainability-related investments 


-  ,  We cant yet answer the headlined question  ( correlation isnt causation )  ,  but its provocative to consider the disparity that emerged between how top-performing companies and lower performers approach sustainability 


-  Distinctions appeared in how they pursue efficiency gains and waste reductions within their operations; how they assess risk; how they view investor expectations; and where they see new opportunities 


-  But sustainability finds some industries faster than others  often for reasons easy to understand 


-  Data throughout the survey show those industries have  better understanding of the business case for sustainability investments and have already realized  competitive advantage from it 


-  Many of these early movers were chemical and resource-based companies ,  where sustainability began as risk mitigation and license-to-operate issues and later evolved into something more holistic 


-  Would you have thought C-suite executives ,  charged as they are with driving financial success ,  to be more interested in long-term considerations than either senior managers or lower-level managers and professionals? ,  These four charts identify interesting aspects of C-suite thinking 


-  One is the variance between the weight the C-suite assigns to environmental issues and the weight it assigns to long-term considerations  ( particularly if employee and customer health and well-being are interpreted as long-term concerns )  


-  The disregard for potential risk-producing outcomes is 


-  ,  But interpretations vary regarding what that outlier branding result means 


-   cynical view: Sustainability-related branding is too often greenwashing ,  its reputational benefits  product of superior communications skills instead of superior sustainability performance or management 


-  But you dont need to look further than the reputation cloud on the opening page of this article  ( browse the names )  to be reminded how competitively useful  healthy sustainability brand can be 


-  ,  But the survey also suggested that  stronger brand may be less its own reward than an umbrella concept covering  diverse set of related benefits that go beyond the normal parameters of brand 


-  ,  Executives interviewed for the Sustainability  Innovation Study argued that engagement with sustainability inevitably breeds an improved understanding of system effects 


-  Survey respondents report that their own companys senior leaders are the top driver of action and organizational attention ,  but customer pressure is  close runner-up 


-  Apparently ,  this applies to both consumer-oriented markets ,  where customers are demanding more sustainable offerings ,  and business-to-business ,  where companies are looking to build greener supply chains 


-  The highest performers and those who consider themselves experts also tend to pay more attention to what rank-and-file employees have to say than other groups 


-  The biggest companies  ( those with more than 100 , 000 employees )  are more convinced that sustainability-driven efforts add to profitability; they are heavily focused on key environmental issues ,  particularly reducing carbon dioxide ,  other greenhouse gases and waste 


-  This acceptance of the need to push forward is displayed in  variety of ways 


-  Although they say they do more than others to quantify the benefits ,  they also are more inclined to consider intangibles and qualitative factors when making decisions ,  or to allow longer payback periods on investments 


-  ,  Smaller businesses ,  on the other hand ,  have  few concentrated sustainability-related advantages ,  the survey suggests ,  and on average they plan to invest more money and management time in sustainability-driven strategies next year than they have in past years 


-  The smallest organizations ,  in fact ,  may have the greatest opportunity to base an entire culture on sustainability-related positioning ,  potentially gaining outsized recognition and market presence
