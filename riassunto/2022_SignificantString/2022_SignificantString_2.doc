-  More than any other error ,  confusing the means with the end is responsible for the dismal digital track record of transformation efforts 


-  They consistently pick poor and misleading key performance indicators ,  such as the number of users per license purchased or the number of processes performed using new software 


-  ,  These digital KPIs miss the point 


-  Transformational leaders recognize digital strategy not as an end but as  means to achieving measurably better business outcomes 


-  They design digital plans around strategic objectives 


-  And ,  crucially ,  they identify  portfolio of enterprise KPIs that measure business value delivered by the transformation  not the companys technology infrastructure 


-  ,  In platform economies ,  radically enhanced digital capabilities become critical to actually achieving the results that manifest  companys strategic objectives 


-  The ability to meet complex supply chain challenges ,  innovate ,  enable hybrid distributed workforces ,  and continually improve both virtual and real-life customer experiences increasingly relies on digitally enabled capabilities 


-  ,  Unfortunately ,  we find KPIs undervalued and underutilized as analytic assets for leading digital change 


-  Most legacy companies treat KPIs as reporting and accounting mechanisms rather than strategic decision drivers; theyre used more to keep score than change the game 


-  Clinging to these legacy KPI perspectives gets in the way of successful digital transformation strategies; these KPIs are literally counterproductive 


-  Top management must define and communicate both the key performance that is required to execute its strategic plan and the digital capabilities that will enable that performance 


-  That distinction is not subtle: Dramatically upgrading technology infrastructure  so-called lift-and-shift approaches  typically results in nothing more transformative than the same old operating models running in the cloud 


-  The real transformation opportunity lies in making strategic enterprise metrics both individually and collectively more visible and valuable 


-  Strategic KPIs invite more rigorous oversight of data governance 


-  Ongoing improvements in predictive/prescriptive analytics ensure better and more effective decision-making 


-  ,  One financial services company we worked with identified agility  which it defined as the ability to rapidly react and respond to customer requests  as  key performance aspiration 


-  Legacy metrics stressing conformance and compliance in back-office processes proved irrelevant to improved customer care or responsiveness 


-  Measuring agility required the company to first identify underlying criteria and data  such as session time ,  autofill  ( whether regulatory and internal process forms could be automatically completed )  ,  customer effort ,  and loan approval cycles  that operationally defined agility 


-  Doing that also meant determining which use cases mattered most and looking for where agility would measurably improve outcomes for both customer and company 


-  It also meant gaining awareness of the risks agility created  most obviously ,  whether streamlining processes for some customers cut corners on creditworthiness reviews and regulatory compliance 


-  ,  Measuring agility along these dimensions forced  radical rethinking of client relationships ,  engagement ,  and use cases 


-  For example ,  why should loyal and established customers have to fill out the same forms and jump through the same approval hoops as newcomers and prospects? Shouldnt loyalty be recognized and rewarded by reducing customer effort and offering special notifications and alerts to valued clients? Doing that for customers meant baking speed and responsiveness into one-size-fits-all processes 


-  The result:  metric that didnt just monitor digital agility but also informed possible investments for agile improvement 


-  ,  By defining ,  designing ,  and delivering transformational KPIs ,  leaders quickly discover where digital transformation is most likely to offer measurably greater efficiencies and superior outcomes 


-  Customer lifetime value  ( CLV )  can be  profoundly transformational KPI: To wit ,  artfully architected CLVs can incorporate disparate data flows such as churn prediction ,  loyalty ,  propensity to buy ,  social network influence ,  and gift giving 


-  Starbuckss popular mobile app  the use of which increased significantly during the pandemic  is transforming how the global caf chain has managed customer relationships and workflows worldwide 


-  Its evolution was harnessed to the companys customer experience and CLV KPIs 


-  If certain data and data flows dont directly inform or enhance  proposed transformational KPI ,  they shouldnt be on the initial transformation road map 


-  As  rule ,  they reflect increased customer value and revenue growth; they operationally align digital capabilities with desired business outcomes 


-  They require  and guide  collaboration between digital developers and business process owners 


-  ,  Designing effective strategic KPI portfolios requires guiding principles ,  including having  balanced focus on predictive  ( leading )  and retroactive  ( lagging )  outcomes; establishing direct ,  observable links between KPIs and the organizations strategic objectives; and crafting KPIs to uncover root causes 


-  For example ,  Achieve 5x revenue uplift and 3x margin improvement by being hyperfocused on customer needs and simplifying operations 


-  Quantitative clarity is key: Measurably diversified sales channels ,  improved customer experience ,  and enhanced cross-functional collaboration are potential deliverables for the vision statement above 


-  For example ,  for the goal enhance cross-functional collaboration ,  high-level actions could be incentivize functions to cross-sell and go to market together and enable functions to effectively share data and reduce duplication 


-  ,  What is the prioritized portfolio of metrics? Winnowing the universe of KPIs into  prioritized portfolio  ( typically five to nine of them )  requires leadership art and management science 


-  ,  For example ,   global hardware company we worked with sought to transform from  product-focused enterprise to an end-to-end solutions provider 


-  With these aspirations in mind ,  we collaboratively created  portfolio of strategic KPIs 


-  These KPIs had technical ,  operational ,  and cultural implications and included the following: ,  Our digitally transforming financial services provider ,  in contrast ,  defined its sought-after capability  agility  along four tactical dimensions: business performance ,  risk management ,  operational excellence ,  and employee experience 


-  The KPIs were meant to reflect value-oriented speed and responsiveness for both people and processes 


-  The following were among them: ,  To be clear ,  there is no correct number of strategic KPIs for the digitally transforming company  though we find somewhere between five and nine to be most appealing 


-  Management debates around portfolio size and scope are invariably contentious ,  but they clarify executive and enterprise priorities ,  put the focus on business outcomes rather than digital inputs ,  and signal leaderships strategic and operational concerns 


-  More than one company weve worked with ,  for example ,  discovered that improving NPS and customer effort metrics required  reduction in the number of planned features and new functionality 


-  Novelty ,  simplicity ,  and perceived value can be at odds; leadership uses KPIs to define and determine the trade-offs 


-  ,  While strategic KPI portfolios may not necessarily be silo busters ,  they provoke internal conversations about interdependencies that havent occurred before 


-  ,  KPI discussions also sharpen leaders thinking about their portfolio mix of leading and lagging indicators 


-  CLV-oriented organizations ,  for example ,  need to consider where it makes more sense to invest in cultivating customer capability through digital diagnostics ,  training ,  and tools versus getting them to use existing products and services more frequently 


-  Does leadership get greater value from better anticipating the future or from better monetizing the moment? ,  Misunderstanding and mismanaging the role of data is the greatest obstacle to successful and sustainable digital transformation 


-  Defining the key data points that individually and collectively make up the KPI portfolio is the first and hardest task in this step 


-  For example ,  who or what is  customer? What constitutes acceptable data quality? What is standard output? Determining clear ,  objective ,  enterprisewide data standards and definitions is essential 


-  ,  Legacy organizations weve worked with have often possessed bold digital ambitions but inadequate command of their data 


-  We found no formal metadata management policies or programs in place 


-  The few data stewards did the best they could ,  given limited guidance and support 


-  No senior manager or working group was tasked with showing return on data as an asset 


-  ,  Yet data is always where the real work of digital transformation begins: Most companies quickly discover that they lack  or cant access  essential data for their KPI portfolios 


-  They may initially scramble to scrape good enough data ,  but ultimately ,  all of them will need to identify and audit both structured and unstructured databases and pinpoint responsibility for data collection and quality 


-  ,  One global technology business we worked with proposed  thoughtful strategic KPI portfolio to guide its customer-centric transformation ,  but two specific metrics exposed its data difficulties 


-  First ,  the company sought to reduce its total approval times for customer quotes 


-  Between the companys account management structure ,  its broad product array ,  and complicated sales incentives ,  detailed responses to customer or prospect queries could take weeks 


-  Second ,  the company sought to better leverage its sales force ,  making increased meetings with customers and prospects  transformation priority 


-  ,  The organization quickly realized that there was no single source of truth for its pricing information and that it had inadequate sales force time-tracking records 


-  Pricing data was owned by individual business groups that understandably wanted to maximize their flexibility 


-  Meanwhile ,  most sales teams didnt reliably or accurately track their members time 


-  While the proposed KPIs were excellent ,  the data to support them was not 


-  This forced the company to revisit and revise its transformation expectations and make  greater commitment to data acquisition and management 


-  For example ,  it began to reward sales teams that agreed to track their time in order to generate the data required to measure progress toward the goal of greater sales force effectiveness 


-  ,  Much transformation disappointment and failure follow expensive investments in superior digital tools that rely on data that is incomplete or inadequate 


-  Digital transformation requires  strategic investment in making data more valuable 


-  ,  Mapping quality data assets to the strategic KPI portfolio is the surest path to effective transformation alignment 


-  Asking executives the following two questions is indispensable to this task: ,  What are your most valuable data sets? This question proves most revealing once leaders define their portfolios 


-  Product and process owners alike are pushed to reevaluate their current data sets in light of their relevance to new KPIs 


-  For the technology company that aspired to establish more agile customer-centricity ,  for example ,  the need to measure total approval time highlighted the value of legacy CRM data sets that captured how long each quote sat at each step in the approval process ,  from pricing to legal ,  risk ,  and so on 


-  ,  What one thing would make your data more valuable? Transformation teams should take more holistic and systemic views of datas potential impact 


-  For example ,  the strategic objective of being more customer-oriented frequently inspires  commitment to tracking every prospect and customer touch point along the entirety of the customer journey 


-  Ultimately ,  return on data becomes an underlying transformation objective 


-  ,  Strategic KPIs  NPS ,  customer churn ,  daily active users ,  or perfect order rate  typically appear as single metrics ,  but they are calculated from skillfully sequenced combinations of data building blocks 


-  Data sets coalesce into data flows 


-  Coordinating ,  sequencing ,  and orchestrating the journey of reliable data through systems ,  processes ,  business units ,  functions ,  and geographies makes calculating trustworthy strategic metrics possible 


-  ,  Well-designed data flows not only aggregate\ninternal systems data but update and integrate relevant external data from third parties or novel sources 


-  Better and more timely orchestration ensures more reliable KPIs 


-  Lagging indicators can be transformed into leaders 


-  ,  Data flows both mirror and enable process flows: For example ,  underlying every digital customer journey is  data journey 


-  Successfully orchestrating strategic KPI data flows requires that data governance principles be intentionally aligned with desired performance outcomes 


-  That is ,  individuals and teams must ensure the quality ,  visibility ,  lineage ,  and timeliness of the data informing  performance metric 


-  Digital developers and their business transformation counterparts must collaborate here 


-  Business process owners ultimately become business process data and metadata owners as transformation efforts proceed 


-  ,  For example ,  who owns customer profile data  sales ,  marketing ,  or account management? Who has the right to make  recommendation to  client on  path to purchase? Does  customer qualify for  promotional offer? What were  clients last three NPS ratings? Effective KPI data governance means these questions arent hypothetical; they are essential to meaningfully measuring success 


-  The ability to reliably answer these kinds of questions is the surest signal of transformation success 


-  ,  Because digital transformation is  process ,  not  destination ,  KPIs are waypoints ,  not endpoints 


-  Culturally and operationally ,  leaders must accept that KPIs have to continuously evolve in order to continue to drive value creation 


-  ,  For example ,   telecom company embraced customer churn as  strategic KPI 


-  Its marketing and finance teams collaboratively created  CLV metric to identify ,  segment ,  and score customers at risk of canceling their service 


-  More-valuable customers would be targeted with promotional offers or upgrades to increase retention 


-  Analytics subsequently identified some previously undervalued customers as social media influencers who deserved higher scores 


-  Incorporating that data into decisions on whom to target with special offers reduced churn rates among high-value customers at very low cost 


-  ,  KPIs continuously improve when linked to better data ,  better analytics and machine learning ,  and better experimentation 


-  Leaders and teams that own transformational KPIs should always seek to make them more valuable by searching out additional data held by the company or third parties 


-  If NPS and customer satisfaction are critical ,  then ever more granular data on on-time delivery ,  returns ,  and customer service queries provides useful leading indicators 


-  If  perfect order rate is paramount ,  then data sets providing better visibility into suppliers reliability are key 


-  For example ,  digital marketers increasingly run experiments to refine messages ,  segment customers ,  and build loyalty 


-  Such experiments might determine when or whether better segmenting customers is more valuable in reducing churn or increasing sales than better personalizing offers for them 


-  ,  Some practitioners may also clone real-time data sets ,  data flows ,  and the analytics composing them in order to simulate different scenarios and experiment with options for improvement 


-  They might test whether more granular data might lead to better performance or how changes in one KPI might affect or influence the performance of another 


-  Better data and analytics improve and enhance KPIs; better data orchestration encourages the discovery of and access to new data sources that strengthen strategic metrics; seeing KPIs as dynamically evolving encourages leaders to look for new KPIs to track new kinds of value the company can create; and ongoing improvement and growth is baked in ,  so digital transformation is ongoing 


-  ,  Too many organizations fail to see transformation as an opportunity to rethink strategic priorities and operations 


-  Our most important insight about transformation is that successful leaders privilege performance and capability improvements over cost and head count reductions 


-  These leaders champion KPIs as  way of holding themselves and their employees accountable against strategic goals 


-  They look to metrics and measures that inspire new thinking ,  new customer insights ,  and new growth opportunities 


-  Their KPIs are as innovative and empowering as the products ,  services ,  and user experiences they sell
