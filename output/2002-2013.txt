2002 fall 1 :
    multimarket and competitive pressure between firms
    overlapping markets create reciprocal problems to firms
    in overlapping market firms attack with aggressive pricing 
    competitive pressure goes from hypercompetition to collusion 
    competition mesured with indexes based on distribution of market shares 
    2 firms experiment an asymmetrical pressure   
    you can't put pressure on each competitor nor cooperate with all of them
    you should do a mix of them
    competitive pressure as being based on five forces:
    buyer power ,  supplier power ,  barriers to entry ,
    threats posed by substitute products and 
    intraindustry rivalry 
    However,none of these factors explicitly accounts the multimarket competition problem

    questions vital to the dynamic stability of an industry
    and the profitability of firms in it
    essential for : ompetitor selection ,  growth plans ,
    product portfolio and diversification strategy ,
    resource allocation priorities ,
    competitive intelligence system ,
    merger and acquisition strategy ,
    and scenario planning process .

    sometimes it is also possible to achieve a win-win situation  
    or create mutual forbearance or encourage indirect competition
