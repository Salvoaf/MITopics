    multimarket and competitive pressure between firms
    overlapping markets create reciprocal problems to firms
    in overlapping market firms attack with aggressive pricing 
    competitive pressure goes from hypercompetition to collusion 
    competition mesured with indexes based on distribution of market shares 
    2 firms experiment an asymmetrical pressure   
    you can't put pressure on each competitor nor cooperate with all of them
    you should do a mix of them
    competitive pressure as being based on five forces:
    buyer power ,  supplier power ,  barriers to entry ,
    threats posed by substitute products and 
    intraindustry rivalry 
    However,none of these factors explicitly accounts the multimarket competition problem
    map based on measured pressures is essential to answering 
    questions vital to the dynamic stability of an industry
    and the profitability of firms in it
    essential for : competitor selection ,  growth plans ,
    product portfolio and diversification strategy ,
    resource allocation priorities ,
    competitive intelligence system ,
    merger and acquisition strategy ,
    and scenario planning process .
    map based can make proactively measurements in competition 
    sometimes it is also possible to achieve a win-win situation  
    or create mutual forbearance or encourage indirect competition
    coherent competitive pressure strategy

    tacit allies and to identify potential acquisitions or opportunities

    firms pressuring each other in this way often improve their profitability ,  avoid further expansion in the overlapping rivals markets ,  limit aggressive actions to the rivals least important markets ,  and focus on growth elsewhere
    Rivals may even give up share in their weak markets in exchange for greater share in their strong markets so they both gain economies of scale

    to create  joint Web site
    strategic advantage through competitor and market selection ,  mergers and acquisitions or formal alliances
    achieve that stability: checks and balances; tit for tat; shared power systems; polarized blocs; and collective security arrangements
    joint operating system
    Bluethooth tecnology was an agreement for big and small companies that led then other companies to use this standard
    selection of the appropriate allies and selection of the appropriate target
    These five types of alliances can be established informally by signaling through public announcements or by applying pressure to create mutual forbearance ,  or they can be created formally through joint ventures and long-term contracts
    Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy saw this as an assimilation strategy to squeeze his company ,  since Suns biggest business at the time was selling Suns Solaris Unix operating systems to communications companies ,  its largest customer segment
    Most industry leaders prefer to fight small battles rather than large ,  risky ones ,  so they target the most vulnerable player
    On the surface ,  the map indicates clearly that ,  in 2001 ,  players such as British Telecom ,  France Telecoms Orange A/S and DT were on the defensive and had to counter Vodafone if they wished to avoid becoming second-tier players
    The simple solution  an assimilation strategy  would have been to merge their mobile operations ,  attract several smaller players and form another pan-European mobile telecom ,   powerful counter-balancing rival to Vodafone ,  thereby creating two polarized blocs in the European wireless industry
    ,  by using competitive pressure maps and  systems approach to understanding the dynamic patterns underlying multimarket contacts within an industry ,  competitors can make  good plan for making contact with enemies and allies alike
-  In fact ,  if used properly ,  pressure mapping can actually reduce the temptation to collude ,  drive industry growth to new heights and in new directions through increased indirect competition ,  and make room for clever small players that act as balancers or members of polarized blocs and collective security agreements
pressure systems require constant reexamination
Indeed ,  if several maps done at periodic intervals are viewed electronically in rapid sequence ,  like an animated film ,  an industry can be seen evolving ,  providing  powerful and visceral understanding of how the world is moving and how the pressure is flowing

the social and environmental pressures facing business 
innovation is one of the primary means by which companies can achieve sustainable growth 
managers have had considerable difficulty dealing with sustainable development pressures 
strategy that integrates the goals of innovation and sustainable development is needed 
In contrast to conventional ,  market-driven innovation ,  sustainable development innovation  ( SDI )  must incorporate the added constraints of social and environmental pressures as well as consider future generations 
SDI is therefore usually more complex and more ambiguous , difficuylty and risky
investments in innovation
improving both environmental and economic performance (win-win)
sustainable development can generate  creative destruction offering opportunities for new entrants and potential threats for incumbent businesses 
competency-destroying radical innovation is needed and it will likely create new capabilities that will ultimately challenge current business practices 
-  The company successfully made the difficult and risky transition from chemicals to bioscience ,
GM crops to wild plant species ,  increased pest resistance and the possibility of the developing economies becoming overly dependent on seed companies 
Traditional approaches to innovation usually ignore such stakeholders ,  but many of them can play pivotal roles in sustainable development initiatives 
-  And that was Monsantos mistake: It failed to recognize the complex ,  ambiguous and ultimately disruptive impact of such secondary stakeholders 
-  With an aggressive ,  scientific corporate culture ,  the company was not prepared to assuage the public fears of genetic modification 
We didnt listen very well to people who insisted that there were relevant ethical ,  religious ,  cultural ,  social and economic issues as well 
innovation
Innovation is now widely recognized as the main driver of industrial growth  as well as  major cause of social and environmental disruption 
From  companys perspective ,  innovation can be  primary source of sustained competitive advantage as well as  significant source of risk ,  competitive disruption and failure 
R&D projects ,  for instance ,  can be unpredictable ,  and even when they are successful ,  unforeseen or uncontrollable external factors often determine whether an innovation gains widespread acceptance 
The Double-Edged Sword of Innovation 
The development of any radical technology can be  particularly difficult task ,  irrespective of SDI ,  because it usually involves  departure from the present knowledge base  ( and is thus competency-destroying )  and may also require vastly different organizational ,  administrative and infrastructure requirements 
-  Companies often prefer an incremental  ( or competency-enhancing )  approach ,  because it allows them to continue profiting from their proven technology and organizational competency base 
Sustainable development requires the recognition of  wide range of stakeholders ,  including secondary ones  ( such as environmental groups )  that are not directly involved in  market relationship but can still greatly affect  companys business 
Stakeholder ambiguity: Because the various stakeholders often have disparate goals ,  demands and opinions ,  they can easily interpret the same situation differently 
The traditional approaches to innovation have generally focused on  narrow range of stakeholders ,  including suppliers ,  complementary innovators ,  customers ,  investors and regulators 
strategies have been driven in part by concerns over energy security ,  sustainability and ,  more specifically ,  climate change
strategic bridging  has allowed Suncor not only to accumulate capabilities for managing secondary stakeholders ,  but also to access  network of credible allies that can help reduce the ambiguity of stakeholder concerns 
addressing the publics concerns and perceptions  that is ,  managing stakeholder ambiguity  might well be the key to the technologys success

that alliances work best when there are moderate differences in technological capabilities between the partners 
the organizational form of an alliance can have  significant effect on the amount of innovation it yields 
Alliances have become increasingly popular as companies look for  higher return on their R&D investments 
allowing companies to share risks and costs 
-  Knowledge transfer is  tricky business ,  particularly when knowledge is complex or tacit 
mutual distrust often hinders learning within alliances 
-  Todays partner ,  after all ,  may turn out to be tomorrows competitor 
In order for alliances to succeed ,  Sampson observes ,  the partners must be both able and willing to share knowledge-based capabilities 
 if the partners are too different ,  theyll have little to say to one another; if theyre too similar ,  theyll have little to learn 
knowledge transfer is easier within more hierarchical organizational forms ,  such as equity joint ventures ,  which benefit from clear lines of authority and common routines 
bilateral contracts and equity joint ventures 
When diversity was high ,  the median firm was found to have benefited over 100 times more from  joint venture 
there is an optimal level of technological diversity within an alliance and organization matters 


2005 fall 1 :
the convergence of the Web and wireless technology has begun to challenge many of the assumptions companies have about their marketing strategies 
advertising and branding models were based primarily on 30-second commercials and magazine ads 
 Within this market segment ,  cell phones have become  status symbol and  means for individuals to express themselves through customized face plates ,  ring tones ,  carrying cases and so on 
mobile communication devices may represent the ultimate expression of an individualistic society 
segmenting people on the basis of their acceptance and use of technology 
As increasing numbers of consumers become users of mobile devices ,  companies will likely develop marketing strategies for exploiting that new medium 
one of the newest forms of marketing is the text-in promotion ,  in which people with cell phones can engage in  variety of promotions by text messaging certain codes (recently partnered to promote the popular movie Finding Nemo by distributing 25 million drink cups that each contained  unique text message code   Consumers could submit the text code through their cell phones to win prizes and downloads such as mobile postcards and Nemo wallpaper )
Like Web communications ,  mobile marketing can be interactive ,  but it offers the possibility of  closer brand connection because of the personal nature of hand-held electronic devices 
Cell phones and PDAs store information about individuals social networks of friends ,  family ,  and business or school contacts 
,  mobile marketing is tied primarily to cell phones because of widespread use as well as the portability of the devices 
brand-in-the-hand strategies 
the true benefit of mobile marketing is realized when brand-consumer communications and interactivity takes place at the more personal ,  contextual and location-based levels 
,  mobile marketing can be used to collect data through the wireless Internet to determine not only the exact location of  consumer at  given time but also the context of why that individual might be there  
With that information ,  more meaningful or relevant advertising messages or promotions can be delivered to the consumer  
Some traditional marketing media ,  like radio ,  TV and print advertising ,  are independent of location  ( for example ,  an ad in  magazine might be read at home or during an airline flight )  ,  while others ,  like billboard and retail advertising ,  are specific to the consumers location  ( for example ,  an Everything on sale sign that is posted in the window of  jewelry store )  
Traditional media are typically lean-back ,  involving little interactivity ,  In contrast ,  some newer types of media are lean-forward ,  requiring  greater degree of interactivity 
mobile marketing is that it enables both brand-consumer interactivity and location specificity 
mobile marketing that enable brands to achieve three objectives:  (  )  foster top-of-mind awareness and attitude formation ,  (  )  increase brand-consumer involvement and interaction through content downloads ,  e-mails that trigger  viral effect and other activities , 
,  recording labels and artists are employing mobile marketing to launch new albums 
Mobile marketing enables frequent consumer involvement and interaction through repeated content downloads and online games and contests 
,  One limitation of traditional marketing approaches is that companies often dont know what actions ,  if any ,  consumers take after being exposed to an ad 
Many organizations capture information about customers in various functional areas ,  including sales ,  marketing and customer service ,  but they lack  sophisticated system for integrating those multiple databases 
iTunes ,  through which iPod users can purchase music recordings over the Web and manage those digital files in their personal libraries 
 MTV has managed to mix universal appeals with local tastes   tactic that could be applied to mobile marketing h
-  For instance ,   company could test  mobile-marketing campaign in  market that is advanced technologically but is not deemed critical  )  and use the results from that effort to launch  more refined campaign at  later date in  market that has less advanced but developing technology and is deemed crucial  
Privacy issues are particularly sensitive with respect to brand-in-the-hand concepts ,  in part because of the personal nature of mobile devices 
they could feel particularly violated when receiving unwanted calls or messages 
mobile-marketing strategies 
although mobile marketing might be  more effective medium in terms of consumer involvement ,  interaction and response ,  it could also be  less efficient medium with respect to audience reach 
,  One way to assess the effectiveness of  mobile-marketing campaign is to use traditional Internet measures ,  such as click-stream activity and the number of registrations ,  downloads and pass-alongs 
mobile marketing as an exploratory platform for experimentation and firm-based learning14 rather than as  vehicle for obtaining quick returns on investment 
,  Most likely ,  mobile marketing will complement  and not replace  the traditional forms of advertising media ,  including TV and print ,  that allow brands significant reach and efficiency in terms of cost per thousand viewers 


2006 fall 1 / winter 13 :
IKEA has emerged as  global player in one of the most fragmented industries in the world 
In general ,  IKEAs success is attributed to the fact that the company has redefined  number of organizational practices in the furniture business 
Its use of global product sourcing and customer self-service results in low costs 
has  tendency to choose the cheapest suppliers ,  and customers pick up ,  transport and assemble most furniture purchases from IKEA themselves 
,  well-designed furniture and an unusual shopping experience result in consumers perceiving that they receive superior value for money spent 
Although IKEAs products are simple ,  most of them benefit from high-quality Scandinavian design 
-  IKEAs huge stores provide plenty of amenities as well ,  such as coffee shops ,  restaurants and even child-care facilities 
,  In the academic literature ,  this approach is known as logical incrementalism 
The essence of IKEAs strategy ,  he wrote ,  consists of offering  wide range of well-designed ,  functional home furnishing products at prices that are so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them 
(Kamprad introduced the first piece of furniture in his mail-order catalog to imitate  successful competitor 


-  It is only because that initial piece of furniture was  huge success that he decided to focus on furniture and ended up discontinuing all other products  few years later 
)
IKEA owes much of its success to furniture that customers assemble and to flat packages that can easily be stacked in  warehouse or carried in  car 
IKEA could never achieve such  low-cost position if customers did not agree to take on some of the tasks usually performed by manufacturers and retailers 
ready-to-assemble furniture kits 
selling unassembled furniture that could be packed and shipped in flat boxes was  way both to reduce the damages that occurred during delivery and to lower shipping costs 
 It was only when IKEA began opening stores that the potential of customer-assembled furniture and flat packages was fully tapped 
,  Another key driver of IKEAs low-cost structure is global sourcing of products 
Kamprad made the pioneering decision to source furniture from communist Poland as early as 1961 
Furniture design is another key element of IKEAs success ,  and it ,  too ,  evolved in response to external pressures 
the decision to perform design in-house was one of the best moves ever made by IKEA
the origin of the companys in-store restaurants can be traced back to the coffee and buns that Kamprad promised to visitors if they came to the opening of the companys first store 
opening the warehouse to customers was totally unheard 
The result was so successful that all future IKEA warehouses were designed to allow for customer self-service 
Kamprad came up with the concept of  showroom 
-  The idea was to provide customers with an opportunity to see the products before ordering them through the mail 
ikea use an incremental approach 
-  In the case of IKEA ,  the vision of offering well-designed furniture at prices much lower than competitors was innovative 
many of the specifics of IKEAs strategy emerged through  process of trial and error 
,  The decision not to be more involved in manufacturing 
,  IKEA so often had its back to the wall that considering threats as potential opportunities became  key element of the companys corporate culture 
,  as noted earlier ,  selling ready-to-assemble furniture is  cornerstone of IKEAs strategy 
an experimental and incremental approach to strategy formation can also be useful for established corporations 
Logical incrementalism is  very useful conceptual tool for reconciling these two conflicting needs
